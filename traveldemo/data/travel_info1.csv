mexico,"As spicy as salsa, intoxicating as tequila and surreal as a Frida Kahlo canvas, Mexico fills the senses, energizes the intellect and nourishes the soul. This huge country encompasses epic landscapes; from northern deserts and snowy peaks of the central sierra, to the jungle highlands of southern Chiapas and the beaches of the Yucatán Peninsula.      Pre-Colombian civilisations made their mark with the vast pyramids of Teotihuacán, stunning temples of Chichén Itzá and countless other archaeological wonders. The Spanish heritage has also been well preserved, with charming towns built around shady plazas and whitewashed churches; San Miguel de Allende, Guanajuato and Dolores Hidalgo are treasures of the central Colonial Heartland.      Mexico today is a booming modern economy, led by its gargantuan capital, Mexico City. Once you adjust to the relentless pace of life in this metropolis, you can indulge in world-class museums, dine in exquisite restaurants, cut shapes in clubs and barter at sprawling markets. Beyond the modern cities, lie sleepy villages where age-old customs and ancient beliefs endure. San Cristobal de las Casas is a major hub, ringed by indigenous villages, with churches combining pagan beliefs with Roman Catholicism. Across the country, lively festivals reflect this blending of faiths, most famously at the Day of the Dead ceremony.      For visitors seeking outdoor adventure, Mexico delivers. Nature lovers can go whale watching in Baja California, reef diving off the Yucatán Peninsula and trekking through the jungle to glowing blue lagoons bordering Guatemala. Adrenaline activities are in amply supply too, from canyoning in Veracruz and hang-gliding in Hidalgo to volcano climbing, caving and river rafting.      One of the great joys of a visit to Mexico is its cuisine. Emulated around the world, its crispy tacos, mole sauces and burritos are amongst the mouth-watering specialities on offer. They are best washed down with one of Mexico’s many beers or a shot of mescal if you’re in the party mood, which everyone else here seems to be.","Mexico  Attractions in Mexico  All aboard the Tequila Express  Home to Mexico's most popular export, the town of Guadalajara in Jalisco state sits amidst fields of blue agave, the plant that is the basis of tequila. You can sample José Cuervo and Sauza's finest liquor at the distilleries, which can be reached via the Tequila Express, a lively tourist train that wends through agave fields whilst plying passengers with tequila.  Climb the mighty pyramids of Teotihuacán  Lying to the northeast of Mexico City, Teotihuacán grew to be the largest of Mexico's pre-Hispanic cities, constructing vast pyramids that surpass those of the ancient Egyptians. Its greatest building is the Pyramid of the Sun, standing at a height of 63m (207ft). It is joined on the Avenue of the Dead to the Pyramid of the Moon, which was originally part of a 'Moon Plaza'.  Commemorate the dead on Isla Janitzio  Janitzio, off Lake Pátzcuaro, is considered the most magical place to witness Mexico's Day of the Dead festival, with candlelit boats conveying Purépecha villagers to the tiny island where they decorate the tombs of their loved ones in an all-night vigil. Similar ceremonies are held from midnight on 1 November to 2 November (All Souls' Day) in cemeteries throughout Mexico; respectful visitors are welcomed.  Cruise the canals of Xochimilco  They may be a world away from Venice, but the beautiful, tree-lined canals and floating gardens of Xochimilco also draw romantic couples floating on brightly painted trajineras (a type of gondola, usually accompanied by mariachi singers).  The canals are the surviving remnants of the Aztecs' original lake and waterways built over by modern Mexico City.  Dip into an ancient cenote  The limestone terrain of the Yucatán peninsula is peppered with deep, naturally formed sinkhole pools known as cenotes, ideal for swimming or diving. Some, such as Xlacah near the archaeological site of Dzibilchaltún, have ritual significance for the local Maya. Others, like Dos Ojos near Akumal in the Yucatán Peninsula, connect to extensive underground cave networks.  Discover Mexico’s living Maya culture  An enclave of traditional Maya culture in the Chiapas highlands, San Cristobal is known for its magnificent weaving: the intricately designed huipiles (loose-fitting blouse) woven and worn by local women open a window on Maya cosmology. San Cristóbal is surrounded by fascinating indigenous villages like San Juan Chamula and Zinacantán.  Dive off Cozumel  From Baja California's deep Pacific waters to the warm Caribbean Sea, Mexico offers some fine dive sites. The reefs surrounding Cozumel island are prized diving spots known for their tropical marine life and unusual coral formations. Other fine spots for diving or snorkelling include Banco Chinchorro coral atoll off Yucatán's Costa Maya, and southern Baja California and Zihuatanejo on the Pacific coast.  Experience the equinox at Chichén-Itzá  The ceremonial city of Chichén-Itzá was built over 1,000 years ago, but the Maya mystique still draws crowds. The best time to visit is during the spring or autumn equinox when shadows show Kukulcan, a Mayan snake deity, working his way up the steps. Other amazing but less-visited Maya sites include Calakmul in southern Campeche and Bonampak, with its polychromatic murals, in Chiapas.  Find your own personal beach paradise  Mexico boasts fantastic beaches along both coasts. On the Baja California Peninsula, many head for Los Cabos, to San Lucas and San José. On the Caribbean side, make for Isla de Mujeres, a slender island off the Yucatán coast fringed by crushed coral sands. Surfers wil be right at home on the Pacific coast, notably along the Costa Azul of southern Baja, as well as to Sayulita and Puerto Escondido.  Greet the dawn at Tulum  Seeing the sunrise over the Maya-Toltec ruins of Tulum, near Playa del Carmen, is well worth an early start. The intentionally top-heavy temples were dedicated to the setting sun, but if you want to avoid the evening crowds, explore in peace then take a pre-breakfast dip in the turquoise sea – the ruins virtually sit on the beach.  Party all night in Cancun  Hedonists should book a ticket to one of Cancún's 15,000-capacity beach parties, which go on all night and most of the day.  Spring Break is the ultimate party period, when many American students come to town to let their hair down. For a more distinctively Mexican blowout, try the Pacific port of Mazatlán for Carnival (preceding Ash Wednesday).  Plunge into the mayhem of Mexico City  One of the world's biggest cities, Mexico's capital brims with historic and cultural attractions. Its gigantic main square is overlooked by the imposing Catedral Metropolitana and flanked by the remains of the ceremonial centre of the original Aztec city of Tenochtitlán. Of the city's myriad museums, the one must-see is the vast National Museum of Anthropology, covering Mexico's astounding archaeological legacy by region.  Saddle up on a Mexican ranch  Luxury guest ranches let you play at being a charro – Mexico's more dressy version of the US western cowboy – with action-packed days in the saddle and relaxing evenings of fine local cuisine and indulgent tequila tastings. Horseback adventures are available all over the country, from a few hours riding for beginners, to weeklong stays in a traditional hacienda, trekking deep into the countryside.  Scale the peaks of Popocatépetl and Iztaccíhuatl  The two snow-capped volcanoes east of Mexico City make for memorable hiking and climbing. Popo, though still active, is ringed by a series of indigenous villages and 16th-century monasteries, which are inscribed on UNESCO's World Heritage list. Popo is a relatively easy hike, but dormant Izta should only be scaled by experienced climbers with proper gear.  See sunset at sacred Monte Albán  Monte Albán, a sacred ceremonial site and centre of the 2,000 year-old Zapotec culture, stands on a hilltop overlooking the surrounding valley. Relive the majestic past glory of this UNESCO World Heritage Site by watching sunset from the top of one of its prominent pyramids. The Central Plaza, the Ball Court, and some of the tombs are also open to the public.  Shop for silver in Taxco  The ornate silver jewellery produced in Taxco is a joy to behold. Fortunes were made from the silver mines here in this stunning colonial town that is a delight to explore on foot. The first booty was sent back to Spain, but much wealth was also poured back into the Church of Santa Prisca and San Sebastián, jewels of Churrigueresque architecture.  Sink into a bubbling hot spa  Central America's ancient civilisations knew what was good for them and they made full use of Mexico's countless hot springs. Follow in the footsteps of the Aztecs with a relaxing spa break. Many luxury resorts boast a pampering spa, but natural hot springs offer a more authentic experience, with many in volcanically active central states including Puebla and near the colonial town of San Miguel de Allende in Guanajuato,  Tour the colourful talavera tiles of Puebla  For chic colonial-style, look no further than Puebla, one of the oldest and best-preserved cities in Mexico, nestled in the foothills of the central Sierra Madre. Many church domes and house walls are covered in talavera, colourful glazed tiles that are still produced by the town's artisans. In particular, don't miss the gorgeously decorated Patio de los Azulejos.",north america,,
cook islands,"Find lazy days dripping with sunshine in the tranquil Cook Islands, 15 sandy freckles in the South Pacific. There are no two ways about it, people come to the Cook Islands for the beaches: pristine ribbons, lapped by sparkling aquamarine waters. For those eager to dive straight in, the Cook Islands' best beaches are at Muri Lagoon and Titikaveka.  Despite covering a vast area, the Cook Islands host a tiny population, and secluded spots are easy to come by. Some islands, such as Rarotonga (where the international airport is situated) and Aitutaki, do feature a number of developed resorts. Mountainous Rarotonga also offers plenty of verdant scenery, should you – unlikely though it sounds – grow tired of the tropical beach paradise.  Situated between Samoa and French Polynesia, the inhabitants of the Cook Islands are Polynesian, with a proud and interesting culture. Calling themselves the Cook Island Maori, they trace their roots on the southern islands back a millennium to Tahiti and the Marquesas, while Samoans and Togans are responsible for settling the northern islands. The Cook Islanders also hold the tradition that New Zealand Maori migrations originated from their islands.  Named after Captain James Cook, who came here in 1770, the Cook Islands didn't come under British control until 1888. In 1965, the inhabitants chose self-government in free association with New Zealand, which had assumed administrative control over the islands at the turn of the century.  Apart from the interesting culture, it's the natural beauty of the Cook Islands that most captivates visitors. The islands are both volcanic and 'near atolls', which is to say land that's mostly lagoon and edged by islets. You'll find Rarotonga teeming with jungle, while Aitutake is the most photogenic island – a true paradise. Expect powdery sand, an abundance of tropical fruits, palm trees and no worries.","Cook Islands  Attractions in Cook Islands  Book yourself on a tour  Whether you want to discover the Cook Islands by foot, in the saddle or on a bike, a land tour will ensure you get the most out of your trip. On the water, kayaking tours, lagoon cruises and excursions in semi-submersible vessels offer the chance to get close to coral reefs and colourful marine life. A cultural village tour provides the opportunity to learn about local traditions such as weaving, coconut husking, fire making and carving.  Embrace the festival spirit  There are various jamborees taking place on the Cook Islands throughout the year, most famously Te Maeva Nui Festival, which happens every July. A celebration of independence, as with most festivals here it is marked with float parades, singing, dancing and sport. Festivals on the islands are often characterised by mixture of traditional rituals grafted onto Christian music and ceremony.  Escape to the Takuvaine and Avatiu Valleys  Scenic drives into the Takuvaine and Avatiu Valleys offer a pretty panorama of lush, tropical scenery. Head inland from the newly redeveloped Avatiu Harbour for the scenic excursion and find maximum tranquillity along the aptly named Happy Valley Road in Takuvaine.  Go whale watching  Come face to fin with humpback whales, which frequent the archipelago's crystalline waters between July and October. In addition to observing the whales from a boat, it is possible to snorkel with them. The waters around the Cook Islands is a designated whale sanctuary, so there's a good chance you'll see one.  Immerse yourself in the underwater world  The Cook Islands are a mecca for scuba divers and snorkelers; visibility is seldom under 30m (100ft) and the underwater sights are stunning with canyons, caves, colourful coral reefs and bountiful marine life. Impressive dive sites include the Matavera Drop-off, the Ngatangiia Swimthroughs, the Koromiri Coral Garden, Mataora Wreck, Papua Canyon and Sand River.  Seek out Arai Te Tonga  On the outskirts of Avarua lie the stone ruins of Arai Te Tonga, one of the most sacred marae sites in the Cook Islands. Before the Europeans arrived this is was the administrative capital of the islands; it was where the ruling Makea family lived and where tribal chiefs were sworn in. It takes a bit of finding, with the quiet back roads proving as exciting as the destination.  Take a dip at Papua Waterfall  Also known as Wigmore's Waterfall, this is the only waterfall on Rarotonga and is a popular spot for a dip. There are pony treks to the falls, which take you through steamy forests, but be warned; the humid conditions are a breeding ground for mosquitos.  Take a hike  Hiking trails abound on Rarotonga, the most popular being the Cross Island Trek, which wends along ancient warpaths. Other popular trails include Pa's Mountain Walk, which takes hikers through the island's lush interior; Te Kou Trek, with its steep ascents and great views; and the Ikurangi Trek, which also provides rock climbing opportunities. Guided reef walks are possible at low tide along Rarotonga's coral fringe.",oceania,,
honduras,"The second-largest country in Central America – and also one of the poorest – Honduras is once ugly and beautiful. Behind the reefs and rainforests, it has the unfortunate claim to being the murder capital of the world and the high crime risk means visitors should be cautious at all times. Some may advise against visiting altogether, but to do so would be to miss out – for Honduras has much to offer those adventurous enough to visit.      The Bay Islands are perhaps the country’s biggest drawing card. The archipelago offers some of the best diving in Central America, not to mention the chance to swim with dolphins and come face to face with whale sharks. The less adventurous can lounge in hammocks and soak up the party vibe, if that sounds too wild.      Back on the mainland, sweeping Caribbean beaches are scattered with charming towns such as Trujillo, with its pirate history, and traditional Garifuna villages, whose Afro-Caribbean culture is an integral part of the national identity. The great Pico Bonito National Park boasts jaguars, monkeys and countless bird species, while the Rio Plátano Biosphere Reserve, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, teems with exotic wildlife and indigenous communities.      In the midst of all this nature, Honduras’ cities are easily forgotten and although soaring crime rates in the likes of San Pedro Sula keep visitors away, it would be a shame to miss out on the colonial architecture of the capital city Tegucigalpa, the Semana Santa celebrations in Comayagua or the lively carnival in La Ceiba.      It may be troubled, but Honduras is a passionate nation, where religion, tradition and family values are the backbone of society and where a love for the national football team can unite even ardent enemies. It is a country where tortillas and beans are served with every meal, where hips swing to Latino beats and the national beer is called Salva Vida, meaning “lifesaver.” It is a country of untamed beauty and wild tropical adventure. Just tread carefully.","Honduras  Attractions in Honduras  Celebrate Easter in Comayagua  If heritage and history are your thing, you'll love Comayagua. The first capital of Honduras is a masterpiece of Spanish colonial architecture: cobbled streets, tiny plazas, whitewashed houses and grand churches, all of which frankly upstage rather tatty Tegucigalpa. The best time to visit is during the unique and fervent celebrations of Easter week (Semana Santa).  Climb Copán’s magnificent ruins  The ancient city of Copán is one of the wonders of the Maya world, a major testament to this advanced culture, most notable for its intricately carved stelae. Highlights of the ruins include the magnificent Acropolis, the Great Plaza, and the Court of the Hieroglyphic Stairway. Base yourself in the charming nearby town of Copán, with its cobbled streets and excellent hotels and restaurants.  Discover La Mosquiitia, Central America’s Amazon  This vast and untamed wilderness is characterised by tropical forests, swamps, rivers and mangroves, and is one of the premier ecotourism destinations in the Americas. At its heart is the Rio Plátano Biosphere Reserve, a UNESCO World Heritage Site teeming with wildlife. Jump aboard a motorised dugout canoe and embark on a safari, staying in a straw-roofed hut in a riverside indigenous village.  Fly through the forest canopy  Try canopy touring: a series of cables are fixed from tree to tree and, attached to a pulley while wearing a harness, you can 'fly' through the rainforest's canopy. Honduras' abundance of thick rainforests and jungles provide ideal opportunities for thrill-seeking canopy tours, with numerous circuits on the Bay Islands, Copán and Sambo Creek, on the north coast near La Ceiba.  Get to know the local wildlife  Honduras' wildlife refuges and national parks offer an exciting, unspoiled landscape, a multitude of flora and fauna, and huge biodiversity including rare mammals such as jaguars, pumas, ocelots, anteaters and tapirs. Tropical and pine forests, mountains, coastal wetlands and huge rivers create a wonderful opportunity for eco-tourism, with high-quality accommodation and expert local guides.  Go birdwatching on Lake Yojoa  Honduras' largest freshwater lake is a magnet for hundreds of species of birds and considered the country's premier birding destination. Flanked by the highway between Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula, the lake is surrounded by coffee plantations, hot springs, caves and waterfalls; and there are plenty of hiking and fishing opportunities along its shores. Lakeside restaurants also serve up some of the tastiest fish dishes in the region.  Hike in Pico Bonito National Park  Take advantage of the excellent hiking on offer in Pico Bonito National Park, near La Ceiba on the north coast. It offers dense green jungle, steep mountainsides, sparkling waterfalls and world-class birding. Pico Bonito itself is a challenging, climb, but there are plenty of gentler hikes through the vast park.  Hop aboard a wildlife boat safari  Nature guides lead boat tours along the winding canals of the Cuero y Salado Wildlife Refuge on the edge of the Pico Bonito National Park, which provides a wildlife habitat for monkeys, alligators and manatees, and some 200 species of birds. Drift through these vast wetlands that lead all the way to the Caribbean Sea and don't forget your binoculars.  Relive the pirate history of Trujillo  Play at being a pirate in Trujillo on Honduras' gorgeous Caribbean coast. Once a thriving port and a former capital of colonial Honduras, Trujillo is today home to many old Spanish buildings, a fascinating pirate history and superb tropical beaches. Nearby are several traditional Garifuna villages and the city is surrounded by national parks.  Scuba dive over coral reefs  The crystalline waters and pristine coral reefs of the Bay Islands provide some of Central America's best dive sites. The islands are one of the world's top destinations for learning to dive, with warm, calm waters and high quality, reasonably priced dive centres. And if you already have your PADI certificate, you can also take courses in underwater photography, cave diving and instructor training.  Splash out in the Bay Islands  The exotic archipelago of the English-speaking Bay Islands is famed as one of the world's premier diving destinations and home to some of Honduras' top beach resorts. Hilly, tropical Guanaja and Roatán are protected by a great coral reef. Backpackers' favourite Utila has sandy beaches ringed by tiny cays shaded by palm trees. There are several smaller islands worth visiting, including the Cayos Cochinos.  Swim with whale sharks  The Bay Islands are considered one of the best locations to spot the world's largest fish, the whale shark. Measuring up to 10m (33ft) in length, these gentle, plankton-eating creatures glide through the waters and it is possible to slip gently into the water and swim alongside them. The Utila Whale Shark and Oceanic Research Centre runs excursions all year round, with the highest numbers seen in March and April.  Tackle the white-water rapids  Experience some of Central America's best white-water rafting along the Cangrejal River, near La Ceiba. The steep terrain of the Pico Bonito National Park creates raging rivers and waterfalls, the most spectacular of which is the Cangrejal. Several outfits offer jungle lodges and rafting experiences outside of rainy season, with the wettest months from August to December.  Take on Tegucigalpa  Admire the view across Tegucigalpa, the temperate capital city, from the site of its Christ of the Picacho monument, set atop the eponymous mountain to the north. Be sure to take a look around the city itself too; it has a certain rough-edged charm, especially the old historical centre with its colonial buildings and winding stone streets.  Try spelunking in Talgua Caves  Also known as the 'Caves of the Glowing Skulls', because of the sparkling reflection off the human bones found here, these caves in the northeast near Catacamas are a spelunker's paradise. The caves have been used by various ethnic groups since pre-Colombian times and are rich in Maya archaeology. Hire a guide as they are well hidden but worth seeking out.",north america,,
northern ireland,"Northern Ireland distils the best of Britain into a bite-sized bundle: its plunging glens and pristine lochs are as gorgeous as any in Scotland; its quaint countryside villages as olde-worlde as anything in rural Wales; and Belfast borrows its Victorian pomp from London.      Of course, it’s irrefutably Irish too, and few visitors get further than ordering a pint of Guinness before encountering the wit and loquacious charm of its inhabitants.  This hasn’t always been the case. For decades it was best avoided due to the riots and bombings of The Troubles, which erupted between Unionists and Republicans in the late 1960s. But since 1998’s Good Friday Agreement, which calmed the fighting and quelled the geopolitical disorder, tourists are starting to appreciate what they’ve missed for so long.      Covering little more than a sixth of the Irish landmass, Northern Ireland has plenty to pique attention: from majestic mountains and bracing coastline to ancient monasteries and toe-tapping live music joints.      As locals will proudly tell you, Game of Thrones was filmed across the country, and coaches now make their way to The Mourne Mountains (Vaes Dothrak), The Haunted Forest (Tollymore Forest Park) and Beric Dondarrion’s hideout (Pollnagollum Cave) for picture opportunities.      Belfast remains the showpiece. Its patched history offset by unbridled nightlife, major cultural attractions (not least the incredible Titanic Belfast museum) and an invigorating restaurant scene. Further west, highbrow arts and goodtime festivals thrive in absorbing Derry/Londonderry, while the tiny cathedral city of Armagh still stands as the ecclesiastical capital of all Ireland.      From the rugged hills of County Armagh and the quiet loughs of County Down to the granite bulk of the Mountains of Mourne, its al fresco treats are many, but one indoor pursuit prevails: drinking, which is as important here as it is south of the border. From countryside boozers to time-burnished city saloons, you’re never far from a pub here.  Northern Ireland’s compact size stands as a selling point. You can sample the pulse of city living, see the sea-bashed magnificence of the Giant’s Causeway, and then mosey back via its mollifying mountains – all in the space of a few days.","Northern Ireland  Attractions in Northern Ireland  Cast a line into Lough Erne  From its salmon to its sea trout, Northern Ireland's fish stock means it's considered one of Europe's best angling destinations. Try Lower Lough Erne in the Fermanagh Lakelands for a prime fishing spot. The rivers of the Causeway Coast in Antrim have several fruitful options too.  Climb Cave Hill  Giving a broad panorama over Belfast city and the surrounding coastal hills, Cave Hill is a rewarding place to head for a view of the capital region – from the bold cranes of the docks to the silvery waters of Belfast Lough. Measuring 368m (1,207 ft) at its peak, it’s said that on a clear day, you can see as far as Scotland.  Discover the Marble Arch Caves  Take an underground boat trip to see the magnificent caverns of Marble Arch Caves in County Fermanagh. Together with the rolling landscapes above ground, the caves form the Marble Arch Caves Geopark giving a rich insight into the region's 650 million years of geological glory.  Discover the charms of Derry  Visit Northern Ireland's second largest city, which combines a riverside setting and a glut of historical sights with an artsy oomph that saw it named the UK's Capital of Culture for 2013. Its name remains a slightly hazy notion (it's legal name is Londonderry, but the local government refers to it as Derry).  Enjoy a pint in a fine Victorian gin palace  Belfast's most famous pub, the Crown Liquor Saloon is a splendidly ornate Victorian gin palace renowned for its glittering decor, its long history (it dates back to the 1820s) and its wide selection of real ales. Order a pint, find a nook and let the worries of the world drift away.  Enjoy the striking landscape over the Glens of Antrim  Admire the nine interlinking Glens of Antrim, a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, which run inland from the rugged and spectacular eastern coast. Covering a distance of some 52sq km (20sq miles), the area incorporates everything from glacial valleys and sandy beaches to waterfalls and forests.  Explore Devenish Island  A 'holy island' in Lough Erne, Devenish Island in County Fermanagh still bears the remains of an Augustinian monastery, including a church, an abbey and a plethora of old gravestones. It's stirring stuff – the island is accessible by ferry from the landing at nearby Trory Point.  Explore the remains of Dunluce Castle  Once the seat of the Earls of Antrim, the fiercely picturesque Dunluce Castle sits half-ruined on a coastal crag. Its cliff-top remains can be explored at will (once you’ve paid for entry). After crossing the bridge and entering the courtyard, it’s surprising to see how large the medieval castle once was.  Hike the heights of the Mourne Mountains  The granite bulk of the Mourne Mountains forms a brooding backdrop to one of the most appealing corners of Northern Ireland – a picture-book amalgam of coast, hillside and wide sky. Their tranquil centrepiece, the aptly named Silent Valley Reservoir, sits surrounded by cottage-speckled valleys and wild slopes. It's little wonder it draws in hill walkers and rock climbers.  Hit the links  Rory McIlroy, Darren Clarke and Graeme McDowell – familiar names on golf leaderboards around the world – all hail from Northern Ireland, and the country has the courses to match. Royal Portrush and Royal County Down at Newcastle are among its most renowned links courses.  Kick back in Belfast  Once the most troubled city in Europe, the last two decades have wrought an extraordinary transformation in Belfast and have seen the Northern Ireland capital become one of the UK's most interesting cities. Fine restaurants, lively boozers and a burgeoning collection of cultural attractions are part of the city's appeal.  Learn of the Troubles with a tour of Shankill and Falls Road  The best guided tours to brace the Troubles (the ethno-nationalist conflict that blighted Northern Ireland for 40 years) are by black cab drivers who bring Belfast's troubled modern history to life. They head along the Shankill and the Falls Roads, taking in the imposing Peace Lines and the famed Republican and Unionist wall murals.  Revel in the relics at Ulster Museum  Trawl through Northern Ireland's best collection of art, archaeology and natural history at Belfast's Ulster Museum. It’s free to enter, and inside you’ll find eye-opening relics from Ancient Egypt, the South Pacific, Africa and elsewhere.     There’s also some very interesting stuff on Ireland’s early days too, as well as various art collections.  Step aboard the Titanic  Unveiled to great fanfare in 2012, on the slipways where the RMS Titanic was built, this large-scale visitor attraction extends over nine galleries, taking visitors through the construction, launch and ill-fated voyage of the world's best-known ocean liner. Titanic Belfast opened 100 years after the ship's infamous sinking.  Step back in time at the Ulster Folk & Transport Museum  Located on the outskirts of Belfast, the Ulster Folk & Transport Museum is two quality attractions in one. The Folk Museum gives visitors the chance to wander through farms, cottages and homesteads preserved as they would have been 100 years ago. The Transport Museum is a lovingly maintained collection of trams, motorbikes and vintage cars.  Taste a tumbler of fine Irish whiskey  You'll find the Old Bushmills Distillery in the village of (that's right) Bushmills in the north of County Antrim. It bills itself as Ireland's oldest distillery and has been knocking out barrels of the good stuff for more than 400 years. Take a tour to get to the heart of the whiskey-making process.  Tour the country on two wheels  With its quiet minor roads, exceptional natural sites and fine coastal paths, cyclists in Northern Ireland are spoilt for choice. Whether you take to the tarmac or venture off-road, the National Cycle Network has over 1,290 km (800 miles) of routes from long distance rides to short trails for a lighter jaunt.  Visit the grave of St Patrick, Down Cathedral  Visit the pilgrimage site of Ireland’s patron saint, St Patrick. He may be the reason that massive amounts of Guinness are consumed worldwide every 17 March, but his burial site at Down Cathedral, in the town of Downpatrick, is a more sobering affair – a lonely granite slab in the churchyard marks his grave.  Wonder at the Giant's Causeway  Ireland's most famous World Heritage Site is a natural wonder, an otherworldly rock formation of some 40,000 basalt columns. Located on the Antrim coastline, the Giant's Causeway draws visitors in droves – try arriving at sunset for fewer crowds and spectacular photo opportunities.",europe,united kingdom,
new jersey,"The famed home of fictional gangster, Tony Soprano, New Jersey might be a compact state, but it packs in bustling cities, hedonistic seaside towns and excellent beaches.      Separated from NYC by the Hudson River, New Jersey’s own cities might feel like an extension the Big Apple, but they have a charm of their own. In fact, Jersey City’s creative culinary scene has wooed many visitors from the other side of the river, while Newark and Hoboken offer a gamut of cultural attractions, leafy parks and hallowed Civil War grounds.      But most fun is the Jersey Shore, an irresistible stretch of coastline luring beachgoers to expansive sweeps of white sand, historic boardwalks and buzzing resorts.

togo,"A great introduction to Africa, ever smiling Togo is a melting pot of more than 40 tribes that together have managed to create a relaxed yet offhand charm in a country so small you can drive across it in under an hour.       Even its biggest city, the capital, Lomé, feels more like a town and is small enough to comfortably traverse on foot. Experience Togolese joie de vivre at the Grand Marche, which occupies an entire city block and sells everything from artisan products to fresh fruit. Better yet head to the Fetish Market, where fetish priests will fix you up with your own protective charm.      Voodoo and other animist beliefs are not just for tourists, with half the population following such practices. Togoville, on the banks of Lac Togo, is the historic home of voodoo in the country, and is a great place to learn more about religious customs and the meaning of shrines. Meanwhile, the lake itself is becoming something of a weekend retreat for the burgeoning middle-class and its desire for fine food and exciting nightlife.      Few leave the palm-fringed Atlantic beaches of Lomé and Aneho, but those who do head off the beaten track and into the hills or savannah will be richly rewarded. The hills offer superb hiking among the dense green foliage of coffee and cocoa plantations, and are where you can find the Kloto carvers, famed for creating multiple connected rings from a single piece of wood.      The savannahs of the north, by contrast, offer the chance to witness a more traditional way of life. Considered a symbol of Togo itself, Koutammakou is home to the remarkable takienta mud houses of the Batammariba people, structures that need to be seen to be believed.      Togo has a peaceful nonchalance that makes a quick conversation in Lomé’s Grand Marche as much of a highlight as any attraction, while its small size makes travel a relaxed and stress-free experience.","Togo  Attractions in Togo  Be at the centre of it all in Lomé  Togo's capital is a mixture of the traditional and the modern. Its old heart is centred on the Grand Marché, a vibrant mishmash of stalls and people selling everything under the sun. A few streets away, the Akodessewa voodoo market is possibly the largest in Africa and welcoming of tourists.  Discover where modern Togo was born in Togoville  In this picturesque location on Lake Togo in 1884 Germany signed a colonial treaty with the Ewe king Mlapa III, making his land a German protectorate. The modern-day chief still shows copies of the treaty to visitors. In the village itself there are numerous voodoo shrines as well as a colonial-era Roman Catholic cathedral.  Explore Aného’s colonial past  Formerly known as Little Popo, this town developed from a slave port and is a place where fisherman in colourful canoes ply the Atlantic waves. Aného became Togo's capital for a brief period in the 19th century and the town preserves a distinctively colonial air reflected in its churches and German cemetery.  Get wet whale watching  Go whale watching in the Gulf of Benin, where humpback whales can be seen breaching the Atlantic surf and thrashing their huge tails every October. Though best observed on an organised boat tour, they can sometimes be witnessed from dry land.  Head north to Koutammakou’s traditional dwellings  See the traditional mud tower-houses of Koutammakou, home to the Batammariba and a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2004. Though basic, the predominately two-storey structures are unique, built to designs handed down unchanged for generations to include space for animals on the ground floor and near-spherical granaries.  Relax in sleepy fishing villages  Explore the country's short coastline, home to several small fishing villages, many of which are home to examples of colonial-era architecture. Head out into the Atlantic on a traditional canoe to catch some fish before having them grilled back on land, or soak up the atmosphere of these welcoming tightknit communities.  Spot wildlife in national parks  Fazao Mafakassa National Park in the semi-mountainous wetland outside Sokodé is Togo's largest and home to 300 species including primates and elephant. Kéran National Park near Kara and the Fosse aux Lions (Lions' Den) southwest of Dapaong are also major drawers for wildlife enthusiasts, while exotic butterflies abound in the lush forests around Kapilmé.  Stretch your legs hiking in Kapilmé  Not only does the hill country surrounding Kapilmé offer a range of hiking opportunities, it also offers rewarding views of the lush countryside while you climb. The walk to Togo's highest peak, Mount Agou, which kisses the sky at 1,000m (3,280ft), takes you through mountain villages and promises views of Ghana on clear days.  Take to the water  Enjoy watersports at Lake Togo's premier resort, the palm-lined Hotel le Lac at Agbodrafo (also called Porto Seguro), which has water-skiing and sailing facilities. For a swim, you can do worse than West Africa's largest pool, the Olympic-sized pool at the Hotel Sarkawa in Lomé.  Unwind on the beach  Togo has many miles of secluded clean sandy beaches lined with coconut palms on its Atlantic coast. Many of the most popular, including Le Ramatou and Robinson Plage, are easily reached from Lomé. The resorts at these beaches also offer the chance to head into the waves, with diving and snorkelling equipment for hire.",africa,,
slovakia,"Like the Czech Republic minus the crowds, Slovakia may sit in the shadows of its neighbour, but the country quietly impresses with its epic alpine scenery, clifftop castles and exquisite capital.     Following the 'Velvet Divorce' of 1993, which saw Czechoslovakia split into two constituent parts (the Czech Republic and Slovakia), the nation set about reasserting its independent spirit, and today there's a humble, creative nature to Slovakia that wins over visitors of all stripes. Enthusiastic about art and music, the country is even home to a burgeoning hip-hop scene.      A small country of just five million odd inhabitants, Slovakia appeals to a broad range of travellers: from backpackers and businesspeople, to skiers and history buffs. It has one or two surprises up its sleeve. It is, for example, quietly gaining prestige as an alternative skiing destination. With its modern skiing infrastructure and new budget flights, Slovakia’s High Tatras mountains are becoming a tantalising destination for winter sports enthusiasts.      As for the capital, it may be compared unfavourably with its neighbour, Prague, but Bratislava is nevertheless an alluring option for a city break. With an air of glamorous Vienna, it is home to gorgeous churches dating back to the 15th century, countless cafes squeezed onto cobblestone streets, and a slew of terrific, sometimes quirky museums.      Part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire for centuries, Bratislava’s architecture is grand Central European in style. It was the Hungarian capital for nearly 300 years, with 11 monarchs crowned in the extraordinary 500-year-old St Martin’s Cathedral.      Beyond its stunning capital, Slovakia boasts some impressive natural landscapes, which remain relatively unspoiled and uncrowded. The country has 10 national parks to speak of, which offer sprawling forests, rolling hills and meandering rivers.      Though Bratislava and the High Tatras mountains remain the star attractions in Slovakia, beyond them lies a diverse and decidedly beautiful land, rich in rewards for those bold enough to explore it.","Slovakia  Attractions in Slovakia  Follow the Carpathian wine route  Starting just outside the Slovakian capital, the Small Carpathian Wine Route snakes through glorious countryside, past ancient wine towns and the wonderfully preserved Červený Kameň Castle. The route offers plenty of stopover options where you can sample the local wine.  Get sporty in Vrátna Valley  From skiing in winter to hiking or biking through glorious countryside in summer, there's plenty to do in the Malá Fatra mountain range resort of Vrátna. The view from the cable car on a sunny day is a must, though impressive all-year-round.  Go underground in Slovakia’s second city  Waterways, fortifications and the cathedral's foundation are all waiting to be discovered by intrepid visitors willing to head underground at Kosice's archaeological site. There's a labyrinth of passages beneath the earth linking together different parts of the ancient town.  Hike the Tatras National Park  Tatras National Park is the oldest national park in Slovakia and home to the famous High Tatras Mountains. Covering an area of 741 sq km (286 sq miles), it's a hiker's paradise. The landscape incorporates dense forest on the mountains' lower slopes, as well as glacial lakes and mountain streams. It's also famous for its chamois (mountain goats), bears and marmots.  Marvel at Bratislava's architecture  To get a sense of the country's past, take a walk up to Bratislava Castle (itself an impressive cultural monument) above the Old Town and gaze out. You'll see the pretty medieval core spread below, while rows of socialist-era tower blocks line up in the distance.  People watch in Kosice  Slovakia's second city is known for its buzzy atmosphere and pretty Old Town. Grab a coffee in the town square, and then take a terrace seat and watch the world go by. When evening rolls around, visit the State Theatre for a taste of high culture.  Relax in the spas of Starý Smokovec  With its stunning views over the Tatras mountain range, this town famed for its mineral waters has a plethora of therapeutic spas where visitors can frolic in mineral-charged, hot spring waters said to cure everything from asthma to arthritis. Slovakia's copious mineral springs mean the country boasts some of Europe's best spas.  Scale the ramparts of Spis Castle  Spis is the largest castle in Slovakia, and one of the biggest in Central Europe. Standing proud on a 200m high (656ft) dolomite hill, it's as impressive for its setting as it for its medieval architecture. Although many parts of the castle's Gothic tower, chapel ramparts and dungeons stand in ruins, there are fine views from the summit. It was once one of the most important Gothic castles in Europe and there's a small museum inside documenting its history during the late Middle Ages, when it was in its prime.  Settlement of Vlkolinec  Some 45 traditional log houses, one of which houses a folk museum, cluster together in Vlkolinec, a delightful village that was awarded UNESCO World Heritage Status in 1993. There's perhaps nowhere better in Slovake to glimpse traditional rural life.  Ski in Jasna  Take to the piste in Jasna, which offers some of Slovakia's best skiing. The Demanova Valley resort has modern lifts and well-maintained slopes. And with prices at a fraction of its Western European alternatives, what's not to like?  Wander around the Andy Warhol Gallery  The provincial town of Medzilaborce isn't the most obvious place to find a classy modern art museum, which makes the Andy Warhol Gallery something of a curiosity. Warhol's parents were from the area. The man himself would have been pleased with the collection on show.",europe,,
gabon,"Gabon is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean, Equatorial Guinea, Cameroon and the Congo. The 800km- (500-mile-) long sandy coastal strip is a series of palm-fringed bays, lagoons and estuaries. The lush tropical vegetation (which covers much of the interior) gives way in parts to the savannah.      There are many rivers along which settlements have grown. Many of the Bantu people are concentrated in coastal areas and villages along the banks of the many rivers. The main cities are Libreville, Port Gentil, Lambaréné, Moanda, Oyem, Mouila and Franceville.      The Republic of Gabon moved peacefully into independence (from France) in 1960. President Omar Bongo, who succeeded Léon M'Ba as president on the latter's death in 1967 is now one of Africa's longest serving heads of state. In 2003, a change of constitution meant that Bongo could run for office as many times as he wanted and Bongo, now in his 70s, is likely to remain as president for life. Gabon's only problem in the region concerns the island of Mbagne which lies in the Corisco Bay, potentially the site of large oil and gas deposits: occupied by Gabon in 1970, it is also claimed by Equatorial Guinea.      But touristic natural resources are likely to centre around features such as stunning white beaches, an abundance of wildlife, including gorillas, panthers, parrots and elephants, and verdant forests.","Gabon  Attractions in Gabon  Explore Bateke and Mayumba  The Bateke Plateau, comprising savannah and forest galleries shaped by tumultuous rivers is a known wildlife hotspot. Creatures include forest elephants, buffalos, river hogs, gorillas, panthers, crocodiles, monkeys and parrots. Alternatively, traverse the enchanting Mayumba, a thin strip of land set between sea and lake, where up to 3,000 humpback whales can be seen between July and September.  Gawp at the Presidential Palace  Gabon's former president, Omar Bongo, ordered the construction of the Palais Presidential on Libreville's waterfront in the 1970s. Costing an estimated US$800 million, it came close to bankrupting the newly independent nation. Even though visitors are not permitted inside the heavily-guarded palace, you are able to view its spectacular modernist design and take photographs from outside.  Get active on the beach  The best beaches for peace and quiet are the deserted beaches of Pointe Denis and Ekwata in Gabon's north, and Mayumba and Sette Cama in the south. Both Libreville and Port Gentil have beaches equipped for waterskiing, while Cap Estérias, 35km (22 miles) from Libreville, is a popular water sports centre at weekends. Perroquet and Pointe Denis offer good skin diving.  Go fishing  Popular among European visitors, many of Gabon's rivers and lakes offer excellent catches, though local fishermen can find the largest variety of fish along the country's 900km (550 mile) Atlantic coast and in the numerous lagoons located at the mouth of the River Ogooué. Equipment can be hired at Port Gentil.  Haggle at Mount Bouet Market  Don't miss the hustle and bustle of Mount Bouet Market, Libreville's largest market. The hundreds of stalls selling food, textiles, household goods and traditional medicines funnel visitors into narrow maze-like alleys. On the market's outskirts is a more relaxed shopping district, predominantly selling printed clothes.  Study local customs at the National Museum  The National Museum of Art and Traditions in Libreville, a short stroll from the Presidential Palace, contains some of the most beautiful wood carvings in Africa, especially the indigenous Fang style of carving, which influenced Picasso's figures and busts. The photographs of Gabon in bygone days, and the musical instruments are also worth some time.  Take a forest safari in Lopé National Park  Easily accessible in the centre of the country, Lopé National Park is Gabon's largest. Its landscape, containing a mixture of savannah and dense forest, provide habitats for lowland gorillas, chimpanzees and forest elephants, as well as a variety of other primates, large mammals and around 350 species of bird which can all be tracked on foot or by car.  Tour Lambaréné’s famed hospital  Spanning the Ogooué River, Lambaréné was brought to the world's attention by the lifelong dedication of Albert Schweitzer, a German-French doctor and world-class musician awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1952. Still functioning, the Schweitzer Hospital includes a small museum dedicated to the doctor created from his basic living accommodation.  Visit the craftsmen of M'Bigou  The villages of M'Bigou and Eteke in Gabon's south are famed for the quality of the normally light grey soapstone extracted from the surrounding hills, and the carvings produced by the craftsmen there that result. The nearby gold mines are also well worth a visit.  Walk the Atlantic coast  The winding route leading from Libreville to the beach of Cap Estérias 35km (22 miles) north offers a chance to explore Gabon's natural beauty, such as the forest of giant trees you will pass through. Rocks abound with sea urchins, oysters and lobsters. Cap Estérias itself is a safe place to swim in the ocean.  Wonder at the carved church of St Michael  The wooden church of St Michael of Nkembo in Libreville is supported by 31 tall and heavily-carved wooden columns, each depicting a scene from Christian and African legend, that were created by a blind Gabonese craftsman. A hall-like structure in comparison to Libreville's other European-style churches, the rich exterior painting depicts St George killing the dragon.",africa,,
montenegro,"Montenegro remains one of Europe’s hidden gems… but for how much longer? Independent since 2006, the country has been quietly developing its fledgling tourism industry and is now being vaunted as one of the continent’s hottest new destinations.      So what does this nascent nation have to offer? Well, inland it’s all pine-scented mountains, rolling prairies and traditional, stone villages, which are a joy for hikers, bikers and nature lovers. The star attraction, though, is the blissful, 293km (183mile) coastline, which gives onto the calm blue waters of the Adriatic Sea.      The most popular coastal destinations are the enchanting Venetian-era port towns of Kotor and Budva, with their medieval stone buildings, family-run seafood restaurants and burgeoning hotel scene. Other less developed seaside towns include Herceg Novi, Petrovac, Bar and Ulcinj, where travellers can get a taste of local life.      The coastline harbours a pleasing combination of long sandy beaches to the south, near Ulcinj, curving pebble bays along the so-called Budva Riviera, and little coves around the perimeter of the meandering Bay of Kotor to the north.      As investment arrives, luxury marina-resorts have begun to spring up, offering mooring facilities for sailing boats as well as accommodation, restaurants, cafes, spas and shops. Porto Montenegro in Tivat is designed to accommodate some of the world’s biggest mega yachts and is indicative of the kind of travellers Montenegro seems to be targeting.      Of course, it’s not all about wealthy oligarchs. Particularly inland, where travellers can grab a slice of traditional Balkan life and lose themselves in rugged mountains, many of which rise above 2,000m (6,560ft).      The hinterland is also home to five national parks. Go in search of bears, wolves and lynx atop the peaks of Durmitor National Park; raft down the River Tara in Europe's deepest canyon; explore Europe's last virgin forest within Biogradska Gora National Park; or go bird watching in the wetlands of Lake Skadar National Park. But go now, before everyone else gets the same idea.","Montenegro  Attractions in Montenegro  Admire the lively port of Kotor  Visit the bustling port of Kotor, sitting at the end of the Kotor Bay. There's plenty to recommend this UNESCO-listed fortified old town, including its Venetian architecture, 17th-century clock tower, 12th-century Romanesque cathedral, naval museum, chic boutique hotels and seafood eateries.  Charter a yacht  It's possible to charter a private yacht for the day and sail around the Bay of Kotor. Ringed by dramatic soaring mountains, this meandering bay is often described as Europe's southernmost ""fjord"", though it is in fact a submerged river canyon. Its shores are dotted with waterside villages made up of centuries-old stone houses and fishing harbours filled with coloured wooden boats.  Discover the tiny floating islands of Perast  On the Bay of Kotor, Perast is made up of old stone villas, overlooking two tiny islets, Sveti Đorđe (St. George) and Gospa od Škrpjela (Our Lady of the Rocks), each capped by a church. The islets can be visited by boat from Perast's waterfront.  Enjoy the luxurious Sveti Sfetan  Southeast of Budva, this medieval stone village, perched on a fortified islet, connected to the mainland by a causeway, is a luxury resort. First converted into a hotel during the Yugoslav years, when guests included Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, it reopened as the 5-star Aman Sveti Stefan in 2009.  Explore the 700-year-oldHerceg Novi  A 700-year-old town with much to recommend, Herceg Novi is a must-see. Visit the fascinating baroque Savina Monastery and the beaches on Luštica peninsula, which overlook the entrance to the Bay of Kotor and are accessible by boat.  Explore the old town of Budva  Protected by medieval walls, Budva's car-free old town is made up of quaint cobbled alleys, lined by Venetian-era buildings, many now hosting restaurants, cafes and souvenir shops. East of town, Slovenska plaža is a long narrow beach overlooked by a string of big modern hotels.  Explore the rugged Durmitor National Park  Hike, bike, kayak, raft or paraglide in stunning Durmitor National Park, which has been awarded UNESCO World Natural Heritage status for its glacial landscapes, high peaks, dense pine forests and some of the deepest gorges in Europe. The highlight is the Crno Jezero (Black Lake), a 3km (2-mile) walk from the national park office in Žabljak.  Go birdwatching on Lake Skadar  The biggest lake in the Balkans, Lake Skadar, on the border between Montenegro and Albania, is on the Ramsar List of Wetlands and is a haven for birdwatching, hosting some 270 species, many endangered or rare. The National Park office is in Virpazar – from here you can take a boat trip across the lake, and eat fresh carp at waterside restaurants.  Go climbing in Lovćen National Park  Take a trip up the rocky mountain massif of Lovćen, towering above Kotor. Its peak, at 1,657m (5,440ft), is home to the Njegoš Mausoleum, dedicated to the Prince-Bishop and poet, Petar II Petrović-Njegoš. From here, you'll enjoy spectacular views, both inland and down onto the Bay of Kotor. The national park office is in Cetinje, which used to be home to the Montenegrin royal family and capital of Montenegro.  Go primordial at Biogradska Lake  Explore the Biogradska Gora National Park, home one of the last three jungles in Europe. The primal forest spans 5,400 hectares (13,343 acres) between the Lim and Tara Rivers. You can also find eagles inhabiting the soaring Bjelasica Mountains. The national park office is in Kolašin.  Hit Jaz, the best beach in Montenegro  Widely considered the best beach in Montenegro, Jaz, just west of Budva, is a 1.2km (0.7-mile) stretch of fine pebble beach, lined with sun beds and umbrellas, overlooking a turquoise bay. Open-air concerts are sometimes staged here – The Rolling Stones played in 2007, followed by Madonna in 2008.  Meet Tara, the deepest canyon in Europe  The highlight of inland Montenegro, at 82km (51 miles) in length and a depth of 1,300m (4,300ft), is the dramatic Tara Canyon. The deepest canyon in Europe boasts endless rapids, adventure sports such as rafting and canyoning. There's also bungee jumping and zip-lining off the Tara Bridge, a five-arch concrete road bridge with amazing views down into the canyon. The nearest towns are Kolašin and Žabljak.  Scale the cliff that bears Ostrog Monastery  You'll be amazed by the 17th-century Ostrog Monastery, which is built into a vertical cliff on the road between Danilovgrad and Nikšić. Inside, in a tiny cave church, lie the remains of the founder of the monastery, St Basil of Ostrog.  Take a tipple or two at Plantaže Winery  Montenegro's largest wine producer, Plantaže is best known for its potent red Vranac wine. Vranac means ""black horse"", which in the past was considered the symbol of strength and beauty, as is this wine. Visit Plantaže's Šipčanik wine cellar, between Podgorica and Lake Skadar, to taste their wines and purchase bottles to bring home.  Wander around timeworn Ulcinj  Walk around Ulcinj, one of the oldest towns on the Adriatic coast. Its top attractions include the Balsica Tower and Renaissance Church Mosque, which is also home to the City Museum. The 12km long (7-mile) Velika Plaža is a fine sandy beach, which remains largely underdeveloped and is backed by a flat hinterland.",europe,,
albania,"Idyllic beaches, warm weather, rich history, spectacular mountain scenery and bargain prices; it sounds like an impossible wishlist for a European destination. Yet Albania fulfils all of these criteria and more. Over the past quarter of a century, this Balkan land has gradually emerged from its austere communist cocoon and savvy travellers have been taking note.      The capital, Tirana, is a curious and cosmopolitan place. Its countless communist-era apartment blocks have been enlivened with licks of brash, bright paint, and in parts of the city these sit shoulder-to-shoulder with Ottoman and Italian architecture. It is haphazard and disorderly, but wildly alive, with the constant whir of traffic and cacophony of voices adding to the buzz.      Leading down to the Greek border is Albania’s greatest asset: the Adriatic coastline (touted as the “Albanian Riviera”). It would be disingenuous to call it undiscovered; the beaches here draw significant sunbathing crowds during July and August. Even so, these heavenly stretches are fresh to foreign tourists - and among the best in the Med. If you can tear yourself off the towel, there are also interesting remnants of Greek, Ottoman and communist history to be explored in nearby towns. Of particular note are the now deteriorated and occasionally repurposed domed bunkers, paranoid follies ordered by the isolationist ex-ruler Enver Hoxha.      Further inland, stony hiking trails weave among the lunar, sun-bleached mountains, where remote rural villages offer up a warm welcome to any inquisitive visitors. With unpaved, pothole-strewn roads and unreliable bus routes, just getting to the country’s interior can be an adventure in itself. But when the logistics of travel prove taxing, there’s always the dangling carrot of lovingly-prepared meals, tasty wine and ever-hospitable locals to spur you onward.      With its winning combination of sandy beaches, engaging history and affordable prices, Albania's once-unsung charms are now being shouted from the garishly-coloured rooftops.","Albania  Attractions in Albania  Berat: Stand in awe at the religious art  Berat is a must-see spot for the fresco-frenzied. St. Todri’s Church, one of the ten surviving churches built since the 15th century inside Berat Castle, boasts paintings of post-Byzantian grandeur by the famous 16th-century Albanian artist Onufri. The Dormition of Saint Mary Cathedral, built in the 18th century is also home to the Museum of Medieval Art.  Butrint: Reclaim the abandoned city  Don't miss the UNESCO-listed, ancient city of Butrint, with archaeological remains and inhabitancy dating back to prehistoric times.

Durrës: Explore ancient archaeological sites  See interesting and accessible archaeological sites in Albania’s second-largest city, such as the abandoned ancient Greek city of Apollonia and the steep-sided Roman amphitheatre in Durrës. The city also boasts a second-century bathhouse and a marble Byzantine forum from the fifth and sixth centuries. Near the coast of the Adriatic Sea, find preserved historical remnants at The Archaeological Museum.  Gjirokastra: Explore the Ottoman architecture  Explore the well-preserved Ottoman city of Gjirokastra for its unique domestic architecture. A UNESCO World Heritage Site, the ‘Stone City’ of Gjirokastra features cobblestone streets, the Bazaar Mosque, unique 17th-century assembly houses and Albania’s largest castle. The fortress sits imposingly on its hill with views of the city and Albanian alps. Visit the Museum of Weapons inside, established in 1971.  Karavastaia: Look out for birds of prey  Pack the binoculars and bird watch in the coastal wetlands of Karavastaja. Part of the Divjake-Karavasta National Park, the lagoon is the westernmost breeding site of the Dalmatian pelican. The birds and their nests cover the 22,230-hectare area, basking in lagoons of sand dunes and deltas.  Kruja: Meet Albania's national hero  Make the easy day trip from Tirana to the family seat of Albania's 15th-century hero, Skanderbeg. Within the medieval castle's walls are two interesting museums, the Gjergj Kastrioti Skanderbeg Museum and the Ethnographic Museum, the latter an immersive view of the Albanian home and customs throughout history. The restored Ottoman bazaar just outside the castle is one of the best for souvenir shopping in Albania.  Lake Komani: Set sail on the ferry  Cameras at the ready; take the ferry up the jade waters of Lake Komani. Hemmed in on both sides with rugged and verdant towering cliffs, the Lake Koman Ferry cruise (komanilakeferry.com/en/) is an enchanting introduction to northern Albania, running from Koman to Fierza.  Porto Palermo: Cycle to a submarine bunker  Cycle from the Borsh village to Porto Palermo peninsula, a former restricted military zone. This 13km (8 miles) trip leads you through views of the Ionian sea and with moderate ascents it is easy on the thighs and pleasant on the eyes. A special detour at the start of the peninsula region leads to a hidden submarine bunker worth taking a break from the pedal for.  Shkodra: Uncover the legend of Rozafa Castle  Built before the Roman conquest, this castle in Shkodra was last used for military purposes as recent as 1913. Rozafa was the last fortress in Albania to fall to the Ottomans in 1479. Legend has it the castle was named after a woman who was walled into the bulwark as an offering so the castle would stand.  Skrapar District: Raft down the Osumi River  With an impressive network of inland waterways, Albania has an abundance of rafting opportunities. In the Skrapar district of Berat, white-water rafting through the spectacular Osumi River canyons is the ultimate adrenaline rush. Zoom from a UNESCO World Heritage Site, enjoy views of waterfalls and carved rock, and prepare to get wet.  Tirana: Delve into Albania’s communist past  For nearly 50 years, Albania was under Communist rule. Although the regime collapsed in 1990, many of Tirana’s communist sights remain, including the murals and statues in the city centre, the house where Enver Hoxha lived and the Pyramid, built as his mausoleum. Take a bus or taxi up to the Martyrs' Cemetery, with its statue of Mother Albania.  Valbona: Hike through the Albanian Alps  Hike in Albania's magnificent mountains. Outdoor Albania (www.outdooralbania.com) organises hiking, skiing and mountain-biking tours throughout the country, but boating to Valbona to trek through the peaks of the Balkans to Theti is a sure favourite. You’ll be accompanied by mountain goats on the trail and eagles overhead.  Voskopoja: Find fantastic frescoes  Admire the vibrant colours of the frescoes in Albania's little-known churches. Voskopoja, near Korça, was once the largest city in the Balkans, full of churches and basilicas, and with its own academy where artists were trained. Although the church buildings look a little tired, the fantastic frescoes still flourish.",europe,,
east timor,"Following its indepedence on 20 May 2002, East Timor became the only Asian country to be located completely in the Southern Hemisphere.      The Portuguese first arrived on the island in the early 16th century and by the 1550s had occupied the eastern part. The Dutch took control of the western part, which became part of the Dutch East Indies and, after independence, Indonesia. In 1975, the new left-wing Portuguese government relinquished all of its colonies. East Timor then enjoyed just a few days of independence, before the Indonesians annexed it as their 27th province. There was little local resistance and the international community largely acquiesced.      In the aftermath, the main independence movement faced a savage counter-insurgency, during which the Indonesian army killed over 100,000 East Timorese. Finally, a referendum was offered to East Timor in 1999, and 80% opted for independence. Violent reprisals by the military followed, but the country eventually became independent.      Colonial architecture, Portuguese fortresses and other treasures from the 100-year Portuguese occupation can be found all over the country. However, many towns and villages were destroyed during the Indonesian occupation and the fighting in 1999, and these are only slowly being rebuilt. Many houses are still erected on stilts in the traditional way, using local materials such as grass, bamboo, tree trunks and palm leaves.      Despite the tragic recent history, East Timor's immaculate reefs, little-trodden mountain paths and rich, traditional cultural that has endured in the face of war make it a true hidden gem. Hiking in the hills will bring you to otherworldly jungle caves, while exploring settlements away from the capital of Dili give a taste of village life. Well off the beaten track, East Timor is still getting back on its feet, but is a raw and compelling destination.","East Timor  Attractions in East Timor  Bask on the beach  There are many beautiful beaches in East Timor, but discerning bathers should make a beeline for Jaco Islands, which is home to the country's finest golden sands. It's about six hours by car from the capital, but the journey cuts through beautiful forests and wends along scenic coastal roads. Looking for something a little closer to Dili? Then try Areia Branca and Dollar Beach.  Discover the charms of Maubara  This small town is a few hours from Dili and notable for the fact that most inhabitants speak Tocodede, a language unique to this district of East Timor. Once in Maubara, visit the 17th-century fort. Once a prison, it has a substantial coastal wall with cannons still pointing out.  Dress up for Carnival de Timor  This annual jamboree lights up Dili every April (or sometimes May, depending on the duration of the rainy season). Revellers don traditional costumes during the carnival and compete for awards, which are given out to the best dressed. The dancing and merriment goes on long into the night with live music and much more entertainment.  Explore Baucau  As they retreated from East Timor, the Indonesians wrought carnage upon the town of Baucau. Yet its quaint, colonial charm still shines through and it remains a fine place to while away a few days. The city abounds with pretty Portuguese colonial architecture and visitors can explore caves used by the Japanese during WWII. There's also a pool, should you fancy cooling off.  Feed your brain in Dili  East Timor's colourful capital abounds with Portuguese architecture, which serves as a reminder of its colonial history. After independence the country was occupied by Indonesia and visitors can learn all about the country's struggle for sovereignty at the poignant Resistance Museum. Housed in a former prison, the Chega! Exhibition offers a grittier take on the struggle against Indonesia.  Go climb a mountain  Thrill seekers are well catered for on East Timor with a selection of mountains that make for world class trekking. The most notable climbs include Mount Matebian and Mount Kablaki in the Baucau district and Mount Ramelau in Ainaro. The breath-taking views are complemented by stunning wildlife that includes eight species of bird unique to Timor.  Plan a getaway to Com  Make a journey to Com, a beautiful fishing village, popular for weekend getaways. The main activities are fishing and snorkelling. The 20 sublime rooms of the Com Beach Resort are a sign of things to come, with talk of a real 5-star resort being developed in the future.  Set sail for Atauro Island  Tutuala is the region to head for if you like watersports and great beaches. Atauro Island and nearby Jaco Island offer excellent diving, snorkelling and birdwatching. Atauro (which means ""goat"") is now firmly on the map as an eco-tourism destination. Watch this space.  Venture into Oecussi province  Oecussi province belongs to East Timor politically, yet is a part of Indonesian West Timor culturally and geographically. Its capital, Pante Makassar is a sleepy little town that lies between the coast and the mountains. Coral reefs off coast offer spectacular diving and snorkelling. Mountain biking and hiking are possible in the interior or in the mountains.",asia,,
qatar,"The eyes of the world are on Qatar right now. Following the discovery of oil in the 1940s, this small Gulf state has been catapulted from a small fishing and trading hub to one of the richest (per capita) countries in the world.      Fuelled by oil and natural gas revenue, Qatar is developing at breakneck speed. Everything from universities to shopping malls, five-star hotels to football stadiums are springing up across the desert floor.      Modern Qatar is, for all intents and purposes, a city-state. Over half of the country's population lives in and around the capital, Doha. Other towns and districts are interspersed between oil compounds that provide Qatar with most of its wealth. Beyond oil fields, the country has its share of natural beauty, with gorgeous beaches line the western coast while spectacular dunes surround Khor Al Adaid in the south. The large expense of Al Thakira mangroves near Al Khor on the eastern seaboard also provides a sharp contrast to the adjoining desert landscape.      While Islam is the predominant religion in Qatar, the society is refreshingly tolerant. Expats are free to practise other religions and their civil liberties respected. The press is also among the freest in the region.      While matching towards liberalisation, Qatar has not lost sight of its deeply ingrained religious and cultural heritage either. Alcohol is only served in hotel bars and restaurants, work calendars are very much decided by religious commitments such as Ramadan, traditional sports such as falconry and camel-racing remain popular pastimes. Indeed, much like the geometrically patterned Islamic Art found all over the country, Qatar is a complex, yet beautiful country.","Qatar  Attractions in Qatar  Al Khor  50km (31 miles) north of Doha is Al Khor, a city with a decidedly laid-back atmosphere. It has beautiful beaches, a Family Park (with a zoo), and also Qatar's biggest dairy farm which has a petting zoo, a playground, an obstacle course, and a horse riding facility.  Al Zubarah  104km (65 miles) northwest from Doha is Al Zubarah. Once a thriving pearl fishing and trading port, Al Zubarah is now an excellent example of an 18th and 19th century Gulf merchant town and is a UNESCO World Heritage site. The most prominent feature here is the Al Zubarah Fort.  Dahl Al Misfir Cave  A geological wonder, this 40m (131ft) deep cave is formed largely of fibrous gypsum which is phosphorescent, meaning it can glow faintly under ultraviolet light. The cave is 40km (25 miles) west of Doha.  Doha  The cultural and economic hub of Qatar, Doha is where most visitors land and base. Within Doha, the 7km (4 miles) long waterfront promenade known as the Corniche is a popular tourist hotspot. Stretching from the Sheraton Hotel at one end to the Museum of Islamic Art at another, the Corniche offers great viewpoints, open lawns, and a harbour where you can hop on a dhow cruise.  Doha, Katara  A purpose-built cultural centre, Katara hosts many concerts, shows and exhibitions year-round. There is also a well-maintained public beach offering water sports, along with restaurants, cafés, markets.  Doha, Museum of Islamic Art  I. M. Pei's beautifully designed museum has become one of Doha's most iconic sights. Inside the space it is light and airy, and the collection of paintings, glassworks, ceramics, textiles and manuscripts is breathtaking. Allow plenty of time to wander. The outdoor terrace is perfect for an evening drink and the on-site three Michelin-starred restaurant is also worth a visit.  Doha, Souq Waqif  Try your bartering skills on the vendors in Souq Waqif where you can find excellent Middle Eastern merchandise from perfumes to spices. Inside, there is a traditional falconry market, a visitor centre hosting cultural shows, as well as a good mix of restaurants. If you don't like to shop, settle down for coffee and watch the world go by.  The desert  The sand desert in Qatar offers spectacular sunrises and clear night skies that are perfect for stargazing. You can also roar up and down the dunes in a 4x4s, a quad bike, or even a surfboard.  The desert, Khor Al Adaid  60km (37 miles) southeast from Doha lies the impressive 'Inland Sea' or Khor Al Adaid, where the sea, together with the surrounding large tidal embayment, spills into the desert. This place supports a diverse range of flora and fauna. Best to book an overnight tour that allows you to enjoy the breathtaking sunset and sunrise.",middle east,,
myanmar,"Once a pariah state, Myanmar – previously known as Burma – is fast becoming the must-see destination in Southeast Asia, helped by an incredible array of tourist sights: golden stupas as tall as skyscrapers, ancient ruins, fascinating hill tribes, unexplored jungles, peaceful beach resorts, legions of monks, and mesmerising cities made legendary by writers like Rudyard Kipling and George Orwell.      Ruled by a secretive military junta, Burma was closed for decades to the outside world. When it finally opened, travellers were initially restricted to a handful of locations: the magnificent temples of Bagan, the floating villages of Inle Lake, the monasteries of Mandalay, and Yangon, the former capital, with its colonial relics and towering pagodas.      That was then. With the end of the travel boycott called by Aung San Suu Kyi, travellers are queuing up to visit Myanmar, captivated by the idea of seeing what Asia was like before the tourists arrived. Nevertheless, the government still controls where visitors can go and what they can see, and many people have qualms that their tourist dollars help fund the military, which stands accused of widespread abuses.      Those who do visit discover a fascinating, and famously friendly culture on the threshold between tradition and modernity. Monasteries are the foundation of Burmese society and even in rapidly expanding Yangon life is focused on Buddhist rituals. The sense of devotion is tangible at the awe-inspiring Shwedagon Paya, which towers over Yangon like an enormous golden pillar.      As Myanmar has opened up to the outside world, travellers have pushed beyond the Bagan-Inle-Mandalay triangle, visiting peaceful outposts like Kalaw, Hsipaw and Kengtung and trekking to remote tribal villages. Smaller numbers make it to the jungles of northern Myanmar or the rain-drenched ports of the far south and west. Myanmar even has its own patch of the Himalaya, accessed from remote Putao in the far north.      Through it all, the mighty Irrawaddy River snakes like a twisting Burmese python, offering some of the most atmospheric river journeys in Southeast Asia. Nevertheless, Myanmar remains a controversial destination, promising significant challenges as well as rewarding experiences.","Myanmar  Attractions in Myanmar  Be bowled over by Bagan  Covering an area of 67sq km (26sq miles), the astonishing archaeological site of the ancient city of Bagan is dotted with the remains of some 2,000 temples, pagodas and stupas, mostly dating from the 11th century. The most atmospheric way to explore is by hot-air balloon, but you can also roam the site by bicycle, on foot or by horse and cart.  Catch a puppet show  Mandalay preserves many of Myanmar's ancient arts, including traditional dance and Burmese marionette theatre, with stunningly colourful wooden puppets. Also keep an eye out for anyeint (comedy) in Mandalay; the most famous comedians in the country are the Moustache Brothers, who were repeatedly arrested for satirising the government at the height of the regime's power.  Climb into the hills of Shan State  The parts of Shan State open to foreigners provide some of the country’s best hiking opportunities and, unusually for Myanmar, offer the chance to stay in local homes or monasteries. Walk through stunning valleys to remote ethnic minority villages close to the northern town of Hsipaw, or take the three-day trek between Kalaw and Inle Lake. Please check the security situation before you travel.  Count the Buddhas at Pindaya caves  The journey to the town of Pindaya from either Kalaw or Nyaungshwe passes through some of the lushest farmland in Myanmar, but the main attraction here is below the ground. The Shwe Oo Min caves are packed with thousands of Buddha images, installed here over three centuries.  Cruise the Irrawaddy River  It's hard to overstate the importance of the Irrawaddy River, which winds its way along pretty much the entire length of the country. A trip on the river offers a fascinating back window onto rural life in Myanmar, with rustic local ferries and long-distance tourist boats that cruise the river between Mandalay and Bagan.  Enjoy the slow pace of life in Hpa-an  Snoozing beside the Thanlwin River, the small town of Hpa-an, in the southeast of the country, is the leaping off point for visits to Buddhist monasteries and karst mountains topped by sacred pagodas. It's a tough climb to the summit of Mt Zwegabin, but the views from the top are stupendous.  Explore Mandalay’s lost cities  The hills around Mandalay are studded with the remains of former royal capitals. Sublime Sagaing is a jumble of hillside pagodas, while the highlight at Inwa is a famous 19th century teak monastery. Teak was also used to build the stunningly photogenic U Bein Bridge in Amarapura. Alternatively take a river trip to Mingun to see the world's largest intact hung bell.  Feel the mystery of Mandalay  Founded in 1857, the former royal city of Mandalay isn't as old as you might have thought, but the old town inside the city walls is rich in palaces, stupas, temples and pagodas. Take a walk up Mandalay Hill at sunset and help young monks to practice their English, or marvel at the gold-leaf-encrusted Buddha image inside Mahumuni Pagoda.  Gaze at golden Yangon  Yangon (formerly Rangoon) is a captivating collection of temples, markets, food stalls and fading colonial architecture. Highlights include the golden Shwedagon Pagoda, one of the most spectacular Buddhist monuments in the world, the gem and handicraft stalls of Bogyoke Aung San Market, and the fascinating colonial district around Sule Paya.  Join the crowds at a Burmese festival  Myanmar has an extensive calendar of Buddhist festivals, many timed to coincide with the full moon. Most feature music and dance, colourful processions and festival food. Highlights include the Amanda Pagoda Festival in January/February, the Pindaya Cave Festival in March, Maha Thingyan (New Year) in March and the Thihoshin Pagoda Festival, Pakkoku, in June/July.  Kick back in Hsipaw  The sleepy town of Hsipaw, northeast of Mandalay, is Myanmar's most popular backpacker hangout, but things here are very low-key. Trains rumble here from the British-era hill station of Pwin Oo Lwin, and the town has a lively market, golden pagodas and hikes to waterfalls, hot springs and ancient ruins in the surrounding hills.  Marvel at Mrauk U  The collection of temples in the former capital of Rakhine – once a powerful independent empire with territory stretching as far west as Bangladesh – are as mesmerising as the temples of Bagan, and still form the centre of a thriving community. This area has seen violence against Rohingya Muslims; check the security situation before you travel.  Meditate with monks  Yangon's Mahasi Sasana Yeik Tha Meditation Centre is a famous destination for travellers seeking to learn more about Theravada Buddhism. Those able to commit to at least six weeks (requiring a special visa) can learn the rituals and philosophy of Burmese Buddhism and participate fully in the daily routines of monastery life.  Ponder the physics of the balancing boulder  The temple town of Kyaiktiyo is famed across Asia for its balancing boulder, which forms the centrepiece of the Kyaiktiyo Pagoda. Pilgrims trek or ride packed trucks to the pagoda to gaze at the tiny stupa crowning a boulder which climbs precariously to the edge of rocky outcrop, held in place, locals believe, by the power of prayer.  Roam through Myanmar’s national parks  Myanmar offers rich opportunities for ecotourism, with national parks teeming with wildlife, including elephants, tigers, leopards and bears. The best parks include the Alaungdaw Kathapa National Park (northwest of Monywa); Hlawga National Park (near Yangon); Popa Mountain Park (central Myanmar); Lampi Island (Myeik Archipelago); and Shwesettaw Wildlife Sanctuary (located in Minbu).  Row out onto Inle Lake  Beautiful Inle Lake was one of the first places in Myanmar to be opened to tourism, and it still ranks high on the list of must-sees. As well as floating villages, floating plantations and floating markets, the lake is famous for its leg-rowers and its ancient stupas. The most popular place to stay is Nyaungshwe on the lakeshore.  Stroll the sand Ngapali Beach  Idyllic Ngapali in the far west of Myanmar is the most famous stretch of sand in the country, but it's hard to get here from Yangon other than by flying. Closer to the capital, Chaung Tha near Pathein is a popular escape for locals, while Ngwe Saung has a growing collection of upmarket beach resorts.  Tour the temples of Bago  One of the easiest trips from Yangon, Bago has its own collection of Buddhist buildings and monuments, including the impressive golden Shwemawdaw Pagoda – technically, the tallest stupa in the country – as well as the Shwethalyaung Buddha, which is considered one of the most beautiful reclining Buddhas in Asia.  Trek to hill tribe villages from Keng Tung  Hidden away in the dense jungles of Shan stage, Keng Tung is where Burmese culture melts into the tribal traditions of northern Thailand. This peaceful town is dotted with Thai-style pagodas, and local guides offer trips into the hills to visit the fascinating villages of Lisu, Lahu-Si and Akha people.  Wander around Shwedagon Pagoda  Rising above the rooftops of Yangon like a golden candlestick, the mighty Shwedagon Pagoda is one of the wonders of the Buddhist world. The stupa rises 112m (367ft) into the air, covered in sheets of real gold and crowned with a symbolic umbrella coated in thousands of carats of diamonds and rubies. Joining the crowds that circle the sacred stupa is one of Myanmar's most sublime experiences.  Watch traditional sports  Myanmar's national game, chinlone, is played with a woven cane ball. Teams of six players aim to keep the ball in the air for as long as possible, using any part of the body except the hands. Look out for impromptu matches in public places. Another sport to watch for its Burmese boxing, the local version of muay thai.",asia,,
belarus,"A country whose landscape is still engulfed by the memories of its Soviet past, Belarus is emerging as a trendy Eastern European hotspot - with the country slowly shedding its Communist reputation to become a budding and modern tourist destination.      Unlike many of its neighbours who chose to become part of the European Union after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, consumerism is notably absent in Belarus – and those who visit are treated to a multifaceted destination rich in history, brimming with culture and populated by warm and generous inhabitants.      And though its popularity is growing, Belarus' appeal might well be in its isolation. Indeed this is one of the few remaining places where you can still see what life was like during the days of communism. Largely untouched, Belarus offers an abundance of Soviet iconography, particularly in the big cities, allowing anyone with an imagination to visualise how things once were.      The main destination is the capital, Minsk, defined by clean streets and neoclassical Stalinist architecture and where a cosmopolitan vibe sits alongside intense national pride. A veritable survivor, Minsk is a city whose character is almost tangible - having time and time again throughout its tumultuous history, refused to say 'die'.      Brest is another city of interest. Nestled on the Polish border, Brest is possessed of charm and an abundance of history, also possibly the most Western of all the Belarusian cities.      Outside of the cities, travellers will discover wide plains, picturesque villages, ancient castles, monasteries and dense forests, not to mention thousands of lakes. National parks protect some of the continent's largest marshlands, as well as some of Europe's oldest untouched woodlands, including Bialowieza Forest, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The countryside also offers the chance to see some of the last remaining collective farms in action.      While Belarus may still represent a corner of Eastern Europe that's still developing in the wake of some difficult times, travellers who give this destination the time it deserves will reap the rewards and are sure to enjoy a colourful, compelling country.","Belarus  Attractions in Belarus  Belovezhskaya Pushcha National Park  Time appears to have stood still for centuries in this primeval forest surrounding Brest. Today, the park is home to over 900 plants and 250 animals and birds including European bison (reintroduced in 1929), tarpan (European wild horse), wolf and lynx. Foreign visitors can visit the National Park without a visa if they cross the border via the checkpoint Pererov-Belovezha but the process can be tricky so it is best to check the official website (https://npbp.by/eng) to obtain a pass before you go.  Braslav Lake District  Situated in the north of the country and some 250km (156 miles) from Minsk is the Braslaw Lake National Park, home to a network of lakes and an atmospheric forest. Flora and fauna are abundant in the region and the lakes are stocked with different types of fish, attracting keen fishermen near and afar. There are 30 campsites within the park plus other accommodation options along the lakeshore.  Brest  The historic city of Brest is 350km (217 miles) southwest of Minsk. One of the highlights of Brest is a tour of its fortress, which was used to repel the German forces during WWII. Inside, a museum chronicles its history back to the 13th century. This history is further illustrated by a fascinating selection of exhibits in the Museum of History and Archaeology. Other worthy diversions include the Puppet Theatre and the 13th century Belaya Vezha (Tower of Kamyenyets or White Tower).  Dudutki, Museum complex of ancient crafts and technologies  A museum dedicated to illuminating the traditional crafts, culture and way of 'old Belarusian life', The Dudutki Museum of Material Culture is 40km (25 miles) from the capital city and is the only private museum in Belarus that presents this elegant balance between past and present.  Grodno  Close to the borders of Lithuania and Poland, Grodno has for hundreds of years been a strategic border town, particularly relevant during WWII. The major sites are the Old Grodno Castle, New Hrodna Castle and Kalozha Church.  Khatyn (Chatyń)  In 1943, all 145 residents of Khatyn village were massacred by a Nazi battalion consisting of mostly Ukrainian collaborators. Khatyn has become a symbol of a number of mass killings that took place during the war, and the memorial now in place is a sobering yet suitable tribute to over 2,000,000 people that died during the three years of Nazi occupation. World leaders who have visited this site include Richard Nixon of the USA, Fidel Castro of Cuba, Yasser Arafat of the PLO, Jiang Zemin of China and Vladimir Putin of Russia.  Lida  About 170km (106 miles) west of Minsk is the city of Lida which once a stronghold of the Lithuanian Grand Duke Gediminas. Gediminas built the mighty Lida Castle on sands for protection against the assaults from Teutonic Knights. Today, the castle features regular knights' tournaments during the summer months and an ice-skating rink in the winter.  Minsk, Trinity Suburb (Troitskoye Predmestye)  The pretty suburb of Troitskoye Predmestye, commonly known as Trinity Suburb, has been loving rebuilt in the 1980s after decades of decline. Places of interest include: The Living Room of Vladislav Golubka, a monument to poet Maxim Bogdanovich and a pharmacy showing a collection of chemist's utensils and books from the 19th century.  Minsk, museums  With 160 museums ranging from Cat Museum to Olympic Glory Museum, the cultural scene in Minsk is surprisingly diverse. Major museums include: Belarusian Great Patriotic War Museum, National Arts Museum and Nature and Environment Museum. Another worthy diversion is the open-air Museum of Folk Architecture and Rural Lifestyle featuring century-old buildings from different regions in Belarus.  Mir  99km (62 miles) southwest of Minsk is the small town of Mir which was once an important centre of Jewish learning and prior to 1939, the town belonged to Poland. Key attractions include the Mir Castle Complex (a UNESCO World Heritage Site), Jewish war memorial, Church of St Nicholas and Trinity Orthodox Church.  Pinsk  Pinsk is 300km (186 miles) south of Minsk and located in the region known as the Marsh of Pinsk, a low-lying land of waters and mists. Apart from a good number of 19th century buildings gracing its city centre, key attractions include the Museum of Belarusian Polesie (Belorusskogo Poles'Ja) and Orthodox Church of St Barbara.  Polotsk  The centre of Christianity during the time of Rus (the first Russian state) lay in the Slavic town of Polotsk, 250km (155 miles) north of Minsk. Polotsk is the oldest of the Belarusian cities, founded in 862 and conquered by Ivan the Terrible in 1563. Key attractions include an 11th century Cathedral of Saint Sophia, Museum of Belarusian Typography and Museum of Local Lore.  Raubichi  About 22km (14 miles) from the capital is the picturesque village of Raubichi, with an interesting Museum of Belarussian Folk Art, housed in an old church. However the main draw nowadays is not the village but the Olympic standard sports complex close by. It is home to a specialized educational and sports institution where winter sports athletes are trained. It is possible to join guided tours of the complex and hotel accommodation is available in this beautiful setting.  Viskouli  For tourists seeking political history, the village of Viskouli is where, on 8 December 1991, leaders of Belarus, Russia and the Ukraine signed the famous agreement stipulating the final disintegration of the USSR.  Vitebsk  Vitebsk, situated 270km (169 miles) from Minsk is the birthplace of the painter Marc Chagall. There is a cultural centre named after him and his family house has been turned into a museum. One of Belarus' oldest buildings, the Cathedral of the Holy Assumption, can also be found here, dating back to the 11th century.  Zhirovichy  The village of Zhirovichy, 190km (119 miles) from Minsk, is renowned for the beautiful 15th century Orthodox Monastery which includes three churches, a cathedral and a belfry, among other buildings. The main building, Cathedral of the Assumption, is an important pilgrimage site as it contains an icon of the Mother of God of Zhirovichy.",europe,,

south carolina,"Sultry climes, a captivating history and enticing scenery: welcome to South Carolina y’all.       The ‘Palmetto State’ is blessed with stunning landscapes – from the rolling hills of the Upcountry to the glistening lakes of the midlands – but it’s the coastline that lures most visitors.       Plant your parasol on the sun-drenched shores of Myrtle Beach for classic seaside fun, with boardwalk amusements, boogie boarding and boat tours all up for grabs. The city is also home to the South Carolina Civil War Museum, which tells the story of the conflict through the eyes of the state.

egypt,"A complicated but fascinating country with some of the most enduring historical monuments on Earth, Egypt stands as an unforgettable travel destination. It’s had to deal with its fair share of turmoil in recent times, but this North African nation remains proud, welcoming and accessible. And with treasures as timeless as the temples and pyramids of the Nile to shout about, it’s not somewhere that’s going to slip from public consciousness any time soon. A trip here still very much has the potential to thrill.      In many ways, there are two Egypts. The first is the Egypt of Cairo and the Nile, of bustling medieval bazaars, noseless Sphinxes, river cruises and Agatha Christie-era exoticism.  The second, and just as integral to many visitors, is the Egypt of the Red Sea, where a spread of large-scale modern resorts caters to sun-seekers and scuba divers. Sharm el Sheikh, with its world-class diving, high-end hotels and desert adventures, is the best known of them.      Most of the country’s ancient treasures were built during the time of the pharaohs. The Pyramids of Giza (the sole survivors of the Seven Ancient Wonders of the World); the lotus-columned temples of Luxor and Karnak; the Valley of the Kings; Aswan and the temples of Abu Simbel: strung along the Nile, these monuments have drawn visitors for centuries. They represent a lasting legacy of one of the most fabled periods of human history.      Of course, the country is best understood not so much for its great monuments or its coral reefs, splendid though they are, but through its people. Bartering for a bargain in Cairo’s ancient Khan al-Khalili bazaar, taking tea and falling into long conversation with a local, or simply stopping awhile in a remote village, silent but for the chatter of hooves on tarmac, will give a glimpse of a country full of character, colour and fortitude.","Egypt  Attractions in Egypt  Admire Alexandria  Nestling the Mediterranean, Egypt's 'second city' has a French colonial atmosphere and a relaxed Greek influence, a mix of continental patisseries, art deco architecture and crowded sandy beaches in summer. Don't miss the Roman Amphitheatre's mosaics or the modern Bibliotecha and museums. Take a walk along the corniche to work up an appetite for a dinner of freshly-caught fish.  Discover the Valley of the Kings  The Valley of the Kings, in the Theban Hills, is where the mummified remains of many Egyptian pharaohs were interred. Although stripped of their contents centuries ago, the tombs still display fantastic wall paintings depicting the lives of the pharaohs. The most famous tomb is that of Tutankhamun, discovered in pristine condition by Howard Carter in 1922.  Dive the Red Sea  The Red Sea justly deserves its worldwide reputation for underwater adventure. Teeming with colourful marine life, the crystalline waters are landscaped with coral and dramatic drop-offs. The Ras Mohamed National Park, a headland 20 km (12 miles) west of Sharm el-Sheikh, shows off this underwater world at its best.  Experience Islamic Cairo  It's bustling and busy in ancient Islamic Cairo, but the crowds thin out along the serene street of Al-Muezz Al-Din, with spot lit mosques and mausoleums lining the pedestrianised cobbled street. A local will, doubtless, offer to take you up a minaret; ascend the one at Al-Azhar Mosque – home to the world's oldest university – for panoramic views.  Explore the temples at Luxor  Straddling the Nile, Luxor is the site of the ancient city of Thebes. On the east bank lies the spectacular Temple of Karnak featuring epic statues, obelisks and lotus-columned halls. In the city centre is Luxor Temple, spectacular when lit up at night. Make the most of the experience by taking a gods-eye view in a hot-air balloon.  Get lost in Khan-el Khalili bazaar  Take a trip to Cairo's famous labyrinthine, medieval Khan-el Khalili bazaar, where haggling for spices, copper, perfume and trinkets has been refined into an art form. Don't miss Fishawi's teahouse; in business for over 200 years, it is the ultimate place to people watch.  Go on pilgrimage to Mount Sinai  For centuries, Christian pilgrims have made the journey to Mount Sinai to witness the sunrise over the desert landscape. The three-hour trek is breathtaking, but if it sounds too ambitious, stay overnight at the UNESCO-listed 6th-century Saint Catherine's Monastery, hire a camel and walk down in leisure.  Kick back in Aswan  The former frontier town of Aswan is a popular stopping-point for cruise liners, and the feluccas drifting along the Nile at sunset is one of Egypt's enduring sights. Attractions include Elephantine Island and Elnabatat's Island (the 'island of plants'), upon which Lord Kitchener built a beautiful botanical garden in the 1890s that's still open to visitors today.  Marvel at the Pyramids of Giza  Egypt's main tourist attraction has long been the Giza Necropolis on the edge of Cairo. One of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, the Great Pyramid dates back to around 2500BC. Wander the site to truly understand the enormity of the building task, or take in the sights by horse or camel, not forgetting to visit the Great Sphinx nearby.  Play a round of golf  While it's not a sport readily associated with Egypt, the country has made quite a golfing name for itself and offers around 20 courses. They range from locations within sight of Cairo's Pyramids – the most famous being the Mena House Oberoi 18-hole course – to settings alongside the Nile and the Red Sea.  Relax at Siwa Oasis  One of six oases in the vast Western Desert, and a good base for desert exploration, Siwa is a peaceful haven of palm-fringed saltwater lakes. Home to the Oracle Temple of Amun visited by Alexander the Great, Siwa is dramatically crowned by the 13th-century fortress ruins of Shali, best climbed at sunrise or sunset to avoid the fierce desert heat.  Snorkel in Sharm el-Sheik  Diving is an ever-popular way to see the dazzling marine life and coral, however Egypt's spectacular coastline is accessible even without a wetsuit. Simply wade out with a mask or snorkel or take a glass-bottomed boat from the shores of Sharm el-Sheik and the fish will come to you.  Take in the Old Kingdom at Saqqara and Dahshur  Few visitors know before arriving in Egypt that the country's Old Kingdom precedes the building of the Pyramids of Giza by many centuries. Acting as the necropolis to the ancient capital of Memphis, Saqqara's crowning glory is the stepped Pyramid of Djoser. Nearby Dahshur is famous for its Bent Pyramid and a huge field of royal tombs.  Take to the Nile  Ply the river between Luxor and Aswan for that quintessential Nile experience. Egrets flock to the water's edge and Egypt's ancient archaeological wonders, including the temple of Kom Ombo, unfold like a storybook along the bank. Lasting between three and five days, take a traditional white-sailed felucca, or splash out on a dahabiya, a luxury furnished wooden barge.  Test your skills as a camel trader  Not the place to buy souvenirs, frenetic (and fragrant) trading takes place most mornings from 0700 at the Camel market (Souq al-Gamaal). An entertaining assault on the senses, Camels are transported from Sudan to Birqash 35 km (20 miles) west of Cairo, before being prodded and poked by potential buyers.  Traverse the Suez Canal  The best way to see this great feat of modern engineering is by boat; the view from the Peace Bridge that crosses the canal near Ismailiya comes a good second. The sight of giant tankers plying the narrow channel between the Red Sea with the Mediterranean is something you don't forget in a hurry.  Wander the Abu Simbel temples  Dedicated to the Pharaoh Ramses II (1304-1237 BC), and his beloved queen Nefertari, the two temples at Abu Simbel stand on the shores of the stunning Lake Nasser. Discovered covered in sand by the Swiss explorer Burckhardt in 1813, they were later moved as part of a massive UNESCO-funded project to save them from the rising water of the lake.",africa,,
brunei,"Thanks to sizeable deposits of oil and gas, the tiny tropical sultanate of Brunei Darussalam has one of the highest standards of living in the world. Its two non-contiguous territories, situated on the northern coast of Borneo in South-East Asia, are home to some of the region's most pristine rain forest habitats.      The country only gained independence in 1984, but has the world's oldest reigning monarchy and centuries of royal heritage. At the helm of the only remaining Malay Islamic monarchy in the world, the Sultan of Brunei comes from a family line that dates back over 600 years. The current sultan, His Majesty Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah, has been on the throne for 43 years and is one of the world's richest individuals.      Visitors to the ""Abode of Peace"" (the literal translation of darussalam) will find the country surprisingly laid-back and relaxing. In addition to admiring the gilded domes, towering minarets and extraordinary ornamentation of two landmark mosques in the capital, Bandar Seri Begawan, tourists can explore water villages by boat and on foot, learn about local culture in several interesting museums, sample delicious Malay cuising (some of the best can be found at open-air markets), and experience the incredibly biodiversity of the Bornean rain forest in Ulu Temburong National Park.","Brunei  Attractions in Brunei  Bandar Seri Begawan Waterfront  The waterfront of Brunei's capital, recently turned into a handsome pedestrian promenade, is a great place for a watery stroll, especially in the evening. Signs point out sights of historical interest, and restaurants offer local and ""exotic"" food and drink.  Bandar Seri Gegawan  Discover the finest view in Bandar Seri Gegawan, the capital, from the minaret crowning the golden-domed Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddien Mosque, which stands in the middle of its own artificial lagoon.  Billionth Barrel Monument  Witness the continuing importance of oil to Brunei's economy - the Billionth Barrel Monument near Kuala Belait is a testament to it.  Brunei Museum  The sultanate's national museum has sections on Islamic art, traditional Bruneian culture and natural history. Highlights include 9th- and 10th-century ceramics and blown glass from the Near East, and a life-size diorama of a Malay wedding.  Empire Hotel & Country Club  See the architectural masterpiece that is the Empire Hotel & Country Club (www.theempirehotel.com), set in acres of tropical gardens at the doorstep of one of the oldest rainforests in southeast Asia. Its golf course has views over the South China Sea and it is Brunei's only beach resort.  Istana Nurul Iman  Said to be the world's largest residence of any sort anywhere in the world, this 1788-room palace is home to the sultan and his family. The interior can be visited only during the three-day Hari Raya Aidilfitri celebrations at the end of Ramadan but the exterior can be admired from the Brunei River.  Jame'Asr Hassanil Bolkiah Mosque  Brunei's grandest mosque, built in 1992 to celebrate the current sultan's silver jubilee on the throne, features intricate terrazzo tilework on the outside and spectacular opulence inside. The complex is especially magical around sunset.  Jerudong Theme Park  This once-extravagant amusement park has lost most of its rides to bankruptcy but has recently recast itself as a family-oriented theme park with plenty of performances, gardens and fountains - fun for children and adults alike.  Kampong Ayer  Built on stilts along the banks of the Brunei River, the sultanate's largest water village is an ideal place to get a sense of Bruneians' traditional way of life. After taking a water taxi over from downtown Bandar Seri Begawan, visitors can stroll among colourfully painted houses on wooden boardwalks.  Kampong Labi  See the hot springs and waterfalls, along with remote forest communities and more longhouses, in the Belait district, near Kampong Labi. River safaris up the Belait River are the best way to experience these.  Kampung Ayer Cultural & Tourism Gallery  Opened in 2009, this museum offers an interesting look at the history of the water village of Kampung Ayer and the crafts traditionally practiced there. A viewing tower affords panoramic views of the bustling Brunei River and the centre of Bandar Seri Begawan.  Longhouses  Spot the splendid traditional longhouses in the Temburong district, an area with large tracts of virgin rainforest.  Malay Technology Museum  Just down the hill from the Brunei Museum, this institution illustrates life in both a Malay water village and a Dayak longhouse. The displays are not the newest but are interesting if you'd like to learn more about local culture.  Muara Beaches  Several stretches of sand suitable for sunbathing are situated not far from Brunei's main commercial and ferry ports. Food stalls make picnicking easy and delicious.  Oil & Gas Discovery Centre  Brunei's main centre of oil and gas production is home to a museum (www.ogdcbrunei.com) dedicated to the extraction of petroleum, source of the sultanate's extraordinary riches. Sponsored by Brunei Shell, the centre has educational programmes featuring science and engineering.  Omar Ali Saifuddien Mosque  Named after the father of the current sultan, this magnificent mosque boasts dazzling golden domes, a 44m-high minaret, sparkling chandeliers and fine carpets. Completed in 1958, it is surrounded by a lagoon that creates dazzling reflections after sundown.  Pulau Selirong mangrove  The largest island in Temburong District, much of it covered with mangroves, has been turned into a wildlife sanctuary where visitors can often spot endangered proboscis monkeys. To get there, book a tour in BSB; it takes 45 minutes from Muara by boat. Other wildlife includes macaques, kingfishers and eagles.  Royal Regalia Museum  The finest, most dazzling royal bling is the draw at this museum, which features the sultan's coronation parade on the ground floor and bejewelled gifts from world leaders upstairs.  Tasek Merimbun lake  Drive out to Tasek Merimbun, Brunei's largest lake. Located in a hill resort in the Tutong District just over an hour's drive from Bandar Seri Begawan, peaceful picnicking, birdwatching and jungle trails await.  Tomb of Sultan Bolkiah  Check out the other royal sites, including the ancient Tomb of Sultan Bolkiah, the fifth sultan, known as the 'singing admiral' for his love of both music and conquest, and the Royal Regalia Building in the heart of the capital, home to a collection of ceremonial objects.  Traditional sports  Try out traditional sporting activities, such as gasing, a game involving highly polished giant tops, and kite flying.  Twelve Roofs House  Once the colonial-era home of Brunei's British high commissioners, this hillside structure now houses exhibits illustrating the sultanate's ""special relationship"" with the United Kingdom. The evocative photos include views of Brunei a century ago.  Ulu Temburong National Park  Enlightened conservation practices have left Brunei's Temburong District with one of the largest tracts of unspoilt rain forest anywhere in Borneo. The small section open to visitors has a vertigo-inducing canopy walk. Access to the park is by motorised longboat.  Watersports  Find more beaches at Muara, Serasa, Kuala Belait and Lumut Beach near Tutong, where watersports are popular.",asia,,
belize,"Sandwiched between Mexico, Guatemala and the shimmering Caribbean Sea, Belize occupies a slice of paradise that is packed with culture, wildlife and a wondrous selection of historical sites. Much of the mainland remains swathed in jungle, where the vestiges of ancient cities punctuate verdant forest canopies. Caracol is the most famous. Its crumbling temples and stone pyramids stand as powerful reminders of the Maya civilisation.      The history is fascinating for sure, but most people visit Belize to see its natural wonders and admirable conservation work; the Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary was the first jaguar sanctuary in the world; the island of Half Moon Caye has been entirely dedicated to the conservation of birds; and the protected Belize Barrier Reef harbours an incredible array of marine life. Visitors can swim with sharks and stingrays along colourful walls of coral, or explore the Blue Hole, renowned as one of the world’s best dive sites.      Numbering fewer than 335,000, Belizeans have surprisingly diverse roots: the country is a melting pot of Creole, Garifuna, Mestizo, Spanish, Maya, English, Mennonite, Lebanese, Chinese and East Indian heritage. Racial harmony, religious tolerance and a relatively peaceful political culture, have allowed these different elements to blend successfully and have given Belize a reputation as a friendly, laidback destination.      Belize’s towns and cities are small and, on the whole, pleasantly unexciting. San Ignacio is a charming enough stop-off for those disappearing into the jungle and Punta Gorda offers insightful home stays with some of the country’s last remaining indigenous communities. The somewhat bland capital, Belmopan, however, is hardly worth going out your way for and bustling Belize City, though energetic and ruggedly charming, is used largely as a gateway to the islands.      And what exquisite islands they are. Caye Caulker, Ambergris Caye, Cayo Espanto (to name a few) are everything you expect from the Caribbean and more; swaying palms, pellucid waters, sandy shores, ramshackle beach bars and charming restaurants. All that’s missing are the crowds. Go figure.","Belize  Attractions in Belize  Climb up Caracol’s ‘Sky Palace’  The archaeological site of Caracol is one of Belize's best-preserved Maya remains, not far from San Ignacio. Thought to be one of the most important Maya cities in the region, Caracol covers a vast area larger than present-day Belize City. Its largest pyramid, Caana, meaning 'Sky Palace', is the largest Maya construction in the country.  Discover Belize’s floral abundance  Learn about the flora of Belize at the San Ignacio Botanical Gardens, its manicured grounds filled with orchids, heliconia and many more tropical plants. Or, if you're interested in the healing properties of plants, discover the native herbs of Belize at the Chaa Creek Medicine Trail nearby. And, while you're in the area, visit the ancient agricultural settlements of the Maya at the archaeological ruins of El Pilar.  Discover Mountain Pine Ridge’s epic waterfalls  Enjoy fine views and secluded streams in the 121-hectare (300-acre) Mountain Pine Ridge Forest Reserve in the Cayo district. The area contains the Hidden Valley Falls, which plunge 305m (1,000ft) into the valley. With many trails, rivers and waterfalls, the Reserve offers a wealth of outdoor activities, including hiking, horse riding, kayaking and birdwatching.  Dive off the Cayes  Belize's most popular destination, Ambergris Caye has everything from diving and snorkelling to golf and even a casino. The reefs and dive sites here are world class; it also has an excellent nightlife and fine seafood restaurants. Ambergris is now often called 'La Isla Bonita', from Madonna's song penned in tribute to its main town San Pedro.  Explore ancient ruins  Wander through Xunantunich, containing some of the most intricate carvings in the Maya world and the most popular Maya site in Belize. The ruins date from AD200 and are found close to the Guatemalan border. Dominating the site is the El Castillo Temple, looming some 40 m (131ft) over the Mopan River; you can climb its steep steps for awesome views over the surrounding jungle.  Get down and dirty in Belize City  An eye-opening alternative to the countryside's natural beauty, Belize City, though tiny, is its gritty capital, showing a different side to Belize. Here, however, is where you'll find real Belizean life, which doesn't depend solely on tourism. It's worth a couple of hours by day to witness its raunchy vibes, but don't expect a Caribbean paradise.  Go underground to discover hidden Belize  Belize's interior hides thousands of caves, providing a rich network of routes to attract cavers and spelunkers. The most accessible cave is Rio Frio Cave in the Mountain Pine Ridge area. Other caves that are easy to visit include Che Chem Ha Cave in Cayo district and Blue Creek Cave in Toledo.  Look out for jaguars in the Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary  Otherwise known as the Jaguar Sanctuary, the 40,500 hectares (100,000 acres) of tropical forest were set aside in the Maya Mountains in 1984 as the world's first reserve for this rare wild cat. You'll be extremely lucky to spot a jaguar, but other residents include jaguarundis, howler monkeys and toucans. There are nature trails and rustic accommodation for visitors.  Plunge into Actun Tunichil Muknal Cave  Near San Ignacio, Actun Tunichil Muknal Cave is a vast chamber used by the Maya for sacrifice to the gods; offering hardy visitors a full day of jungle hiking followed by wading, swimming and clambering through narrow passages. Not one for the claustrophobic or faint-hearted, but this site is possibly one of Belize's most rewarding adventures.  Scale a Maya temple at Altun Ha  Visit Altun Ha, a major Maya centre dating from 250BC. A huge quantity of jade was uncovered in the site, including an ornate carved head of a Maya god, which is now a national symbol of Belize. You can explore the plazas and temples dotted around the site, the largest of which is the Temple of the Masonry Altars, where the jade head was found.  See Belize’s amazing animal life  For its wealth of wildlife, in particular birds, Belize is a natural hotspot. Crooked Tree Wildlife Sanctuary is most notable for its jabiru storks as well as monkeys, coatimundis and reptiles. Alternatively, visit Half Moon Caye Bird Sanctuary between March and August to see the rare red-footed booby with its chicks. The island sanctuary is a day trip from either Belize City or Ambergris Caye.  Snorkel and dive off Belize’s barrier reef  Belize has the longest barrier reef in the Western hemisphere, a wall of coral stretching almost the length of the whole country. You can go snorkelling from cayes such as Ambergris, Caulker and Half Moon Caye; or for one of the world's best dive sites, try the Blue Hole: the vivid blue sinkhole measures 300m (1,000ft) across and over 120m (400ft) deep.  Surf or swim off Caye Caulker  Its pristine coral cayes are the main reason most people visit Belize, and Caye Caulker is the quiet, laid-back one. Windsurfing or kite-surfing here is magic: the water is so clear, you can spot fish, stingrays and even dolphins from above the waves. The best wind conditions usually occur from February to June.  Swim in St Herman's Blue Hole National Park  This inland pool is not to be confused with the offshore Blue Hole dive site. The turquoise waters of the Blue Hole, a 7.6m-deep (25ft) collapsed sinkhole, are a popular swimming spot within the national park near Belmopan. The park is home to an abundance of birds, animals, flora and St Herman's Cave, an ancient Maya cave.  Swim with sharks and rays in Hol Chan Marine Reserve  An option off Ambergris Caye for non-divers is to swim and snorkel with the nurse sharks and stingrays in the Hol Chan Marine Reserve. The animals swirl around you in the crystal-clear waters. This protective reserve is also the habitat of some 40 types of coral as well as dolphins, manatee and many tropical fish.  Take a boat trip to Lamanai  Some 25 miles (40km) by motorboat up the New River from Orange Walk leads through tropical jungle to Lamanai, site of a spectacular Maya citadel. Today, the ruin sits in its own archaeological reserve, home to howler monkeys and many birds. You can climb the High Temple, or visit the museum, the remains of two 16th-century Spanish churches and a 19th-century sugar mill.  Wait patiently for a passing manatee  Belize is one of the world's best places to observe manatees, or sea cows, in the wild. Join a tour at the Swallow Caye Marine Sanctuary: these gentle aquatic mammals are an endangered species, typically growing to about 3m (9.8ft) long. You'll need to have patience – but it'll be worth it.",north america,,
missouri,"Sophisticated cities, lazy summer road trips and adventures in the Ozark Mountains: all this, and more, awaits in Missouri.      Arrive in St Louis, the state’s largest city, and the distinctive Gateway Arch, which soars above the Mississippi River, might be the first thing you spot. But the city is also home to the stunning Forest Park, a fantastic art museum and more microbreweries than you can shake a stick at.      On the other side of the state lies Kansas City. Your mouth starts to water as you approach this western Missouri metropolis and snatch a whiff of its legendary barbecue joints, hickory-smoked meat and dry-rub ribs. It’s a sports-mad city that also lays claim to a thriving arts scene and terrific live music.      Away from the hustle and bustle, Missouri is ripe for road trips and outdoor adventure. You won’t find it marked on any modern maps, but historic Route 66 slices southwest from St Louis, mostly replaced today by I-44.

Missouri has its share of quirky roadside attractions, too. The biggest is surely the rather incongruous Titanic Museum Attraction in Branson, a half-scale replica of the ship (complete with iceberg poking into its hull) where you can walk the Grand Staircase and cabins, stand on a sloping deck and touch chilly water for the full sinking experience.      For a smaller-scale (and more realistic) floating adventure, you can raft or canoe the Current or Jacks Fork Rivers.

new south wales,"The oldest state in the country, New South Wales gives many travellers their first taste of Australia; and it tends to be a potent one. Sydney’s ravishing waterside setting and cultural vibrancy make it one of the greatest world cities and its overall package – beaches, skyscrapers, Opera House and all – means it remains very much the centrepiece of the state (even, some might argue, the entire country).      It’s a city to enjoy on your own terms. Lose yourself in the markets and coffee houses of the outer suburbs, laze in the open parklands of the centre, catch one of the ferries crisscrossing the water or tick off the big sights, from Bondi to the Harbour Bridge. History is a big draw here too, with much of the architecture, especially in ‘The Rocks’, harking back to the early days of settlement.      Heading out of town, one of the state’s biggest natural draws lies just an hour or two away: the eucalyptus-hazed spectacle of the Blue Mountains. And there’s more – much more – to enjoy once you travel further afield. From the country music vibe of rural Tamworth and the hippy surfing outpost of Byron Bay to the winelands of the Hunter Valley and the national parks of the interior, there are few regions that can boast such variety.      Whether you remain in NSW throughout your trip or use it as a springboard to travel elsewhere in the country, the state makes for an absorbing place to explore. From the soft, sandy beaches of Nelson Bay to the rainforested parklands of northern Nightcap National Park, it lays claim to being one of the headiest and multi-layered regions in Australia.","New South Wales  Attractions in New South Wales  Blue Mountains   74 km west of Sydney lies the World Heritage-listed Blue Mountains.

nebraska,"Outlaws, pioneers and adventurers have all sought a piece of Nebraska, so instead of zipping through on your way to somewhere else, take a look around and prepare to be surprised. Sure, there’s a lot of prairie and farmland, but there are also buzzing cities, unique landscapes and quirky sights.      State capital, Lincoln, has a student vibe, a hip and historic downtown, and flourishing arts and music scenes. You can catch big-name artists and sports stars in the shiny Pinnacle Bank Arena, tap your toes to jazz and blues in the Zoo Bar, or wander the sculpture garden of the Philip Johnson-designed Sheldon Museum of Art.      Nebraska’s biggest city, Omaha, reveals its own impressive line-up. Listen to the Omaha Symphony in the near-perfect acoustics of the Holland Performing Arts Center or rock to indie bands at the MAHA Music Festival. Slice through succulent hunks of Nebraskan ribeye in chic eateries or relive your teens (albeit with legal booze this time) through old-school arcade games and craft ales at Beercade.      Track those lawless criminals on the Outlaw Scenic Byway, which passes snaking rivers, grass-covered sand dunes (the Sandhills) and charging waterfalls. Stop off for wagon rides, bison-spotting, paddling and homemade pies.      Hike on giant fungi in Toadstool Geological Park, a classic Badlands landscape, named for its mushroom-shaped rock formations. And no, your eyes aren’t deceiving you: that really is a Stonehenge-inspired sculpture looming on the horizon near Alliance. Only this one is made from vintage cars, spray-painted grey to resemble its English cousin. And it’s called Carhenge.","Nebraska  Attractions in Nebraska  Chimney Rock  Discover state attractions such as the pioneer landmark of Chimney Rock; and Fort Robinson State Park, where Chief Crazy Horse surrendered in 1877.

saba,"Saba sits majestically at the peak of a submerged extinct volcano. As such, the island abounds with stunning vistas of dramatic cliff faces and spectacular rocky shorelines. With only one road ('The Road') and a population of less than 1,500, Saba is the most unspoilt island of the former Netherlands Antilles, and the superb preservation of the island's unique ecosystem has earned it the nickname of 'The Unspoiled Queen'.      In fact, until 50 years ago, Saba was a secluded oasis, having neither an airport nor a sheltered harbour. There are four villages, which until recently were only connected by thousands of steps cut into the rock. A road now links the airport with the island's capital, The Bottom. The Bottom is situated 250m (820ft) above the ocean on a plateau surrounded by volcanic domes.      Saba, a special municipality of The Netherlands, was a member of the Netherland Antilles until it was dissolved on 10 October 2010.","Saba  Attractions in Saba  Admire The Bottom  We're talking about Saba's capital, The Bottom, of course, which is surely one of the world's best-named cities. It's more of a town, actually – and it's a pretty one at that. Nestling in a verdant valley beneath lofty mountains, The Bottom is the entry point for most visitors to the island. There's not an awful lot to do in this town of 500 people, aside from admire the Dutch architecture and peruse the sleepy stores, though it does come alive for Carnival, which takes place over summer.  Delve into an underwater world  Experience the stunning marine life along Saba's craggy coastline. Although Saba has no beaches, the waters around the island have been declared a protected marine park in recognition of the unique opportunities for wall diving. Giant sea turtles and humpback whales are seasonal visitors.  Enjoy a climber's paradise  Climb up one of the island's many outcrops as recommended by the Saba Conservation Foundation. With its volcanic terrain and unique geology, Saba is something of a climber's paradise, with a wealth of dramatic drop-offs and boulders to keep even the most hardened adrenaline junky amused.  Go and explore Fort Bay  Visit the rocky beach at Fort Bay, where a dramatic steep climb has been carved out of the rock. En route to the summit walkers will pass the island's four villages, which are mere clusters of ornate timber cottages perching on the flanks of the mountain.  Go green on Saba  Saba has a burgeoning reputation for having impeccable green credentials and none more so than with its commitment to eco-tourism and exceptional scuba diving, climbing and hiking. Sabans are rightly proud of their history of environmental conservation and endearingly refer to their nation as the ""The Unspoiled Queen"".  Party at the carnival  In common with most other Caribbean islands, Sabans do like a party and naturally tend to throw an annual carnival. Saba's Carnival shimmies and shakes into life in the last week of July and boasts a dazzling parade, competitions, steel bands and mouth-watering food.  Take a hike on the trails  Get active and head up one of the many marked hiking trails that lead up to Mount Scenery, from where you can take in the stunning views. Although some of the more difficult trails require a guide, many of the easier routes will take you through Saba's lush rainforests, tide pools and historic ruins.  Take it easy at the Hilltop spa retreat  Relax at the island's hilltop spa retreat, where you can indulge in a treatment or meditate with a spot of yoga. Saba's undulating typography can be exhausting for hikers, so the spa can be a welcome sight.  Visit the Harry L Johnson Memorial Museum  Take in the Harry L Johnson Memorial Museum in Windwardside, the restored home of a Dutch sea captain. Windwardside also contains the tourist office, the island's two largest guesthouses and most of its shops.",caribbean,,
netherlands,"As flat as a local pannenkoek, the Netherlands is a land of colourful tulip fields and canals, sophisticated cities and some of the most striking coastline in Northern Europe. It punches well above its weight culturally, laying claim to the likes of Van Gogh, Rembrandt and Mondrian, amongst others.      At the head of the state sits the country's constitutional monarchy, whose palaces dominate many of the larger cities, including The Hague and the capital city, Amsterdam. The latter, renowned for its step-gabled houses, ubiquitous bikes, seedy red light district and hazy coffeeshops, is bisected by a UNESCO-listed network of waterways, many of which are spanned by beautiful, latticed bridges.      To the south lies Rotterdam, an industrial port city that has benefitted from a complete makeover in recent years, acquiring a slew of excellent museums and an unlikely affinity for hip-hop in the process.      The butt of many a northern joke, the southern city of Maastricht lies in the much-maligned Limburg region. Despite the teasing, this is a city of delicate beauty, dotted with churches, bisected by a mighty river and home to what is almost certainly the best bookshop in the world, Selexyz Dominicanen.      Back towards the coast, the Netherlands becomes more stereotypically Dutch, with vast colourful fields of tulips dotted with windmills and dairy farms producing the wheels of cheese for which the country is so famous. The low-lying Dutch countryside is scattered with a network of charming towns and villages such as Edam, Haarlem and Leiden, which have changed little over the centuries.      Best of all though, are the sandy, North Sea beaches of Zeeland, which stretch for an almost unbroken 650km (403-miles). With more sunshine than any other part of the Netherlands, Zeeland is the Dutch riposte to the Caribbean – and with better cycling trails and museums, if not the hot weather, to boot.","Netherlands  Attractions in Netherlands  Afsluitdijk  Drive or cycle across the Afsluitdijk, a 30km (19 mile) barrier built in the 1930s to close off the Zuiderzee from the North Sea, creating the now freshwater IJsselmeer.

Arnhem  Take a trip to Arnhem (www.vvvarnhemnijmegen.nl/arnhem), in southeastern Holland, scene of WWII's 'Operation Market Garden', in which the city's Rhine crossing proved a 'Bridge too Far' for the allied forces attempting to bring an early conclusion to hostilities.  Bloemenveiling Aalsmeer (the Aalsmeer Flower Auction)  Get up early to witness trading at Bloemenveiling Aalsmeer (the Aalsmeer Flower Auction) (www.royalfloraholland.com).

It's best to arrive by 7 am; Thursdays are busiest.  Boat tour  Take a glass-topped boat tour round Amsterdam's many waterways and harbour. It is an excellent way to see the city's most interesting areas. Another option is to take a boat tour (www.lovers.nl), which links most of the major cultural attractions.  Cheese markets  Enjoy the spectacle of one of Holland's cheese markets. The best are Waagplein, in Alkmaar (www.alkmaar.nl), where every Friday from mid-April to mid-September, thousands of wheels of cheese are lined up in rows by the central weighing house, taste-tested and carted away by guildsmen in traditional costume. The town of Edam holds a similar market on Wednesdays in summer.

Nationaal Park Zuid Kennemerland  Cycle or hike through the Kennemerland national park (www.np-zuidkennemerland.nl/299/en), a unique ecosystem skirting the coast west of Haarlem. Paths weave through woods, by lagoons, and up along massive dunes, which stretch 20km up the coast. Bright blooms enhance the golden sands in spring.  Rent a bicycle  Rent a bicycle and join the Dutch on the country's most popular form of transport. There are around 29,000km (18,019 miles) of designated cycle tracks around The Netherlands, which due to its generally flat landscape, is ideal.  Rotterdam  Standing at the mouth of the Rhine river, the port of Rotterdam (www.rotterdam.nl) is a showcase for innovative architecture. Ride the high-speed lift up Euromast in Rotterdam (www.euromast.nl), and dine at a height of 100m (328ft) overlooking the world's biggest harbour. Then, if you're brave, ascend even higher to 185m (605ft) with the Euroscoop experience. Step back into history at De Zaanse Schans village (www.dezaanseschans.nl), a short distance from Amsterdam, with its traditional houses, working windmills, clog factory, cheese farm, boat builder's and several museums.  Royal Palace (Koninklijk Paleis)  The Royal Palace (www.paleisamsterdam.nl/en), which dates from 1648, was originally Amsterdam's town hall; it is regarded as the most important cultural and historical building from 17th-century Amsterdam. The building's exterior was originally made of white stone, although none of the white is actually visible today, whilst famous painters including Rembrandt and Ferdinand Bol were brought in to contribute to the interior. Today, the palace, which has been state property since 1936, houses an impressive collection of furniture left behind by Napoleon who made it his home in 1808, as well as chandeliers and clocks from this period. The palace is the official residence of the Dutch Royal Family. Its interior is open to the public.  The Hague  Seat of Dutch government and royalty, as well as of the International Court of Justice, Den Haag (denhaag.com/en) thrills architecture fans with its rich catalogue of palaces and government buildings. As an added attraction, the adjacent seaside resort of Scheveningen features a vast sandy beach.

azerbaijan,"The original 'East-meets-West' destination, Azerbaijan sashays between space-age cityscapes and Arabian Nights exotica, taking in some of the most extraordinary landscapes in Caucasia en route.      Sitting at the crossroads between Europe and Asia, this former Soviet Republic is marginally bigger than Ireland, yet boasts an astonishing variety of natural wonders – from snow-capped mountains and bubbling mud volcanoes to sandy deserts and subtropical forests.      The northern hinterland is arguably the prettiest region thanks to the Caucasus Mountains, which rise to the misty heights of 4,466m (14,652ft). These lofty peaks are home to bears, wolves and leopards, not to mention nomadic shepherds, who move their flocks up and down these mountains in search of fresh pastures as they have done for thousands of year.      Meanwhile, along the boulevards of downtown Baku, nouveau riche residents butterfly between expensive boutiques. The capital's exclusive shops, modern architecture and luxury hotels – spoils of Caspian Sea oil – jar somewhat with the UNESCO old town.      Though oil has transformed the economy in recent years, Azerbaijan has always been of strategic importance. Nestling on the shores of the Caspian Sea, the camel caravans of the Silk Road once passed through the land, which, over the centuries, has been incorporated into the Persian, Turkish and Russian empires.      Today Azerbaijan is a sovereign state and, although Islamic, the mood is determinedly secular. Alcohol is not only readily available, but proudly produced. Grapes have been cultivated here for millennia and local vineyards develop some excellent wines. Azeri cuisine is also enjoying a renaissance thanks a profusion of new eateries popping up in downtown Baku.","Azerbaijan  Attractions in Azerbaijan  Baku, Fire Temple  18km (11 miles) west of Baku city centre is Surakhani, home to the Fire Temple of Baku or Ateshgah of Baku. Built in the 17th century, it was the worship place of Zoroastrians, but was also used by Indian devotees of Shiva.  Baku, Museums  Baku is home to several excellent museums including the Azerbaijan Carpet Museum, Azerbaijan National Art Museum and National History Museum.      Azerbaijan Carpet Museum      Located in a building modelled on the shape of a rolled carpet, this museum showcases a rich collection of beautiful carpets and artifacts. If you want to purchase a beautiful Azerbaijan carpet, we recommend you to get one from the shop at the Carpet Museum and keep the certificate with you. All carpets must have a certificate stating the price and the age of the carpet. Please note that anything more than 30 years old is subject to an export tax and must be approved by the Ministry of Culture.      Azerbaijan National Art Museum      This extensive collection displays Azeri, Russian and worldwide art from prehistoric times to modern movements, housed in two adjacent buildings. The local modern art is particularly interesting.      National History Museum      Housed in an oil baron's sumptuous Belle Époque mansion in central Baku, this informative museum provides a detailed overview of Azerbaijan's history with plenty of striking exhibits from Bronze Age jewellery to Ruritanian military costumes, all with English-language explanations. The no-expense-spared interior design and plush furnishings of the old house are also of interest.  Baku, stroll along Baku Boulevard  Take a stroll along Baku's tree-lined promenade for sea breezes, manicured gardens and soothing water fountains. A Ferris wheel offers fine panoramas of the Caspian Sea, while inviting garden cafés can be found scattered along the leafy promenade. Typically, the evening is the best time to visit when locals go to walk off dinner.  Baku, the Old City (Icheri Sheher)  Explore the fabulous Içeri Seher (or Icheri Sheher), the walled old city of Baku and a UNESCO World Heritage site. The narrow streets, honey-coloured city walls, caravanserais, quaint houses and mosques provide a nostalgic glimpse of old Baku before the oil boom of the 20th century created the modern city. Stop for tea in one of many atmospheric cafes and drink in the views. Famous sights within the Old City include the Maiden Tower and Palace of the Shirvanshahs.      Maiden Tower      Climb the spiral staircases inside Maiden's Tower, which overlooks the Caspian, and marvel at the stunning 360-degree view of the city from 30m up. Informative multi-lingual touch-screen installations provide a fascinating overview of the building's history, from 500BC onwards. It was rebuilt as a fortress in the 12th century.      Palace of the Shirvanshahs      This is the largest monument in Baku's Old City and dates from the 15th century. Painstaking restoration and imaginative new displays give a flavour of the rich and cultured lifestyle of the Persian Sufi ruling dynasty - the music, the paradise gardens, the lovely art and sumptuous costumes. The upper stories were blown away by an early Russian naval bombardment in the 18th century.  Beşbarmaq dağı (Besh Barmag Mountain)  Join mystic-minded Azeris on a climb up Beşbarmaq dağı (Five Finger Mountain), which rises dramatically 520m (1,706ft) above the coast just north of Baku and is one of Azerbaijan's most holy animist sites. Rock has been worn smooth by devout kisses and Tibetan-style prayer flags festoon the bushes. Prayers are led by mullahs but the mountain was considered sacred long before the advent of Islam.  Fire Mountain (Yanar Dag)  Watch the flames dance at Fire Mountain (Yanar Dag), a 30 minutes' drive from Baku, where a 10m (33ft) wall of fire blazes day and night thanks to underground natural gas. The spectacle is more impressive after dark.  Gobustan National Park  About an hour's drive from Baku is Gobustan National Park which is famous for three things: prehistoric rock carvings, mud volcanoes and Gaval Dash (musical stone).      Prehistoric rock carvings      The area is said to have been inhabited continuously for at least 20,000 years and early inhabitants have left striking petroglyphs of giraffes, elephants, aurochs, lions, shamans and tattooed dancers. Archaeologists believe that the first humans to migrate out of Africa also stopped here. It is a UNESCO World Heritage site and contains the earliest known representation of a boat.      Mud volcanoes      Bubbling out of the lonely hills of Gobustan, these enchanting mud volcanoes offer the chance to witness geology in action. The mud is reputed to have therapeutic properties, but don't get too close: it is boiling and from time to time splutters out in a great ball of fire.      Gaval Dash (musical stone)      This big flat stone makes a tambourine-like sound when it is hit with an object, quite a surreal experience.  Kiş, Sheki  High on a hillside above Sheki, this tiny village serves up a traditional slice of Azeri life. It's also home to a charming 12th century church which captivated the late Norwegian explorer, Thor Heyerdahl, who believed the original Norse gods were Azerbaijanis who migrated to Scandinavia during the Roman period.  Lahıc, Ismailli  Shop for exquisite copper products in the Persian mountain town of Lahic, where great hiking, charming architecture and natural beauty combine for the ultimate mountain escape. Workshops, smithies and craft shops line the cobbled streets and the tourist office can help arrange homestays with local families.  Shaki  Discover Shaki, one of Azerbaijan's most beautiful towns, which nestles in the foothills of the Caucasus Mountains. Highlights include Khan's Palace, which is set in ornamental Persian gardens and contains stunning murals and stained glass, and the Karavansarai Hotel, whose faded charm captures the once thriving days of the Silk Road.  Sirvan National Park  Get your binoculars out at Sirvan National Park. Due south of Gobustan, this little-visited slice of coastal wilderness is well worth exploring. The birdlife is outstanding, particularly during the spring and autumn migrations, and is easily viewed from lakeside platforms. Also on display are Azerbaijan's last goitered gazelles and their antagonists: wolves. Wild boar and jungle cats are also common.  Xinaliq  Discover the remote mountain village of Xinaliq, where you can find a unique ethnic group of proto-Caucasians who have inhabited this part of the mountains since the Bronze Age and have preserved their original language, customs and traditions. The best option to Xinaliq is to rent a car or share a jeep with others from Quba; the journey is about 1 hour and 25 minutes. Don your hiking boots as there are several great hikes around Xinaliq including the trail that connects Xinaliq and Laza.",asia,,
kentucky,"Bourbon, bluegrass and one heck of a horse race: what’s not to like about Kentucky? The beating heart of America’s bourbon industry, visitors can sip (okay, glug) their way through the likes of Jim Beam and Maker’s Mark on tasting tours of the state's top distilleries.      Much of this corn-based liquor is quaffed during the Kentucky Derby, described by plaudits as ‘the greatest two minutes in sport’. The state goes mad for this blink-and-you’ll-miss-it horse race: fancy hats are dusted off, bets are placed and mint juleps are quaffed at extraordinary speed. Held in Louisville, the Derby is part of a two-week festival, which kicks off with the USA’s biggest fireworks display, followed by a smorgasbord of events, including a marathon and steamboat race.      If you’re inspired to snatch a bit of action yourself, saddle up and canter across the prairies or take a tour of a thoroughbred centre to spot future winners.      Aside from riding, you can hike the Appalachian Mountains, rattle along mountain bike trails in the Daniel Boone Forest, or duck underground in Mammoth Cave, the world’s longest cave system. You can canoe gentle rivers, paddle white water rapids, or hook blue catfish in the Ohio. Or how about exploring Civil War battlefields and the birthplace of Abraham Lincoln?      The soundtrack for any Kentucky trip is bluegrass, and music aficionados can track the birthplaces of such legends as Billy Ray Cyrus and Loretta Lynn along Route 23, the Country Music Highway. Time it right, and it won’t be long before you’re slurping another bourbon and tapping your toes at a bluegrass festival.","Kentucky  Attractions in Kentucky  Belle of Louisville  Ride on the nation's oldest steamboat, the Belle of Louisville (www.belleoflouisville.org), which still sails along the Ohio River.

queensland,"Life in Queensland is riddled with all the right sorts of Australian clichés: lazy barbecues, golden beaches, reef and rainforest, limitless sunshine and cold beer. It’s a wonderfully diverse state; full of spirit and rich diversion, exuding a sense of life being lived at its rightful pace. With its wildlife, weather and the seemingly unlimited range of outdoor activities, it’s hard not to fall in love with its sandy shores. Bungee-jumper, birdwatcher or beach bum, you’ll find plenty to enjoy.      Attention tends to fall, naturally enough, on the coast. The Great Barrier Reef is the headline attraction, stretching along the coastline for 2,300km (1,429 miles), serving up some of the most spectacular scenery in the country, both above and below the water. Whether you’re joining a yacht in the Whitsundays, learning to dive in Cairns or just taking a road trip up to the tropical north, the reef can be experienced in all manner of ways.      To the south, state capital Brisbane is the third-largest city in Australia and a lively place to spend time, drawing plaudits for everything from its riverside setting to its food scene. Meanwhile, Surfers Paradise caters for the party crowd, Noosa is a super-relaxed coastal refuge, and Fraser Island lays on 4WD adventures. Heading inland, the craggy drama of the Great Dividing Range and the sweeping scenery of the outback hold highlights of their own.      To the north, Daintree Rainforest shelters a vast array of flora and fauna, stretching up to the lush greenery of Cape Tribulation. Slightly further west you can experience the magic waterfalls of Atherton Tablelands, of which Millaa Millaa is the most famous. A little further down and you stumble upon the old school charm of Magnetic Island, whose secluded beaches offer castaway vibes.      From the postcard glam of the Gold Coast to the back-of-beyond beauty of its furthest reaches, Queensland continues to be the state that arguably serves up more quintessentially Aussie experiences than any other.","Queensland  Attractions in Queensland  Beerwah, Australia Zoo  The Crocodile Hunter Steve Irwin's legacy lives on at this unique wildlife park in Beerwah, 74km (46 miles) north of Brisbane. The Australia Zoo is home to many animals, among them tigers, rhinoceros, elephants and, of course, crocodiles.  Brisbane  With its year-round sub-tropical climate and pretty riverside gardens, Brisbane makes a great base for visitors to delve into the eclectic art scene and take day trips to idyllic neighbouring islands. Must-see galleries include the Queensland Art Gallery and Gallery of Modern Art. The Henderson Gallery, which focuses on artists who are or were prisoners and first-time exhibitions, is also worth checking out.  Cape York Peninsula  At the northernmost tip of Queensland is Cape York, a peninsula jutting out into the Torres Strait. The Aboriginal Rock Art is one of the main draws – hundreds of paintings cover the rock walls, some dating back 4,000 years or even older. You can also take a Dreamtime walk with an Aboriginal guide, attend a cultural show, or try to paint your own boomerang.  Daintree Rainforest  On the northeast coast of Queensland lies the Daintree, a large expense of tropical rainforest. Take a guided walk, cruise the Daintree River looking for crocodiles, zip-line through the canopy, or head to Cape Tribulation, where the rainforest meets the Great Barrier Reef.  Fraser Island  Off the southeastern coast of Queensland, Fraser Island is the world's largest sand island. Characterised by stunning freshwater lakes, coloured sand cliffs, lush rainforests, secluded creeks and long, white sandy beaches, this idyllic island attracts thousands of visitors each year.  McPherson Range  On the border between Queensland and New South Wales lies the McPherson Range in all its glory, boasting lush rain-forested mountains and scenic wilderness areas. Visit Lamington National Park which has an extensive network of walking tracks along the McPherson Range, giving visitors a chance to explore the area’s forest creeks and waterfalls.  The Gold Coast  The Gold Coast runs for some 40km (25 miles) along Queensland's southeastern coastline. Its beautiful beaches and reliable swells are the main draws. Surfers Paradise is arguably the best-known tourist hotspot in the area. There are many activities to do in the Gold Coast, including surfing, whale watching, visiting one of the many waterfalls in the hinterland, or getting your heart racing at one of the many theme parks.  The Great Barrier Reef  A UNESCO World Heritage site, the Great Barrier Reef is arguably the most famous marine-protected region in the world. Stretching approximately 2,300km (1,429 miles) along the coast of north-eastern Australia from Bundaberg to Cape York, the Great Barrier Reef is the largest coral reef system in the world and home to approximately 400 types of coral, 1,500 species of fish and 4,000 types of mollusc. You can take a catamaran from Cairns to swim, dive, or snorkel.  The Sunshine Coast  Stretching from the Great Sandy National Park in the north to Caloundra (near Brisbane) in the south, the Sunshine Coast offers miles of beaches that are also renown surf spots. Noosa and Coolum are holiday hotspots while Maroochydore is the cultural capital of the region. From the village of Tewantin, you can also catch a ferry to explore the Noosa North Shore, the Great Sandy National Park and Fraser Island.",oceania,australia,
guinea,"Okay, so Guinea might not be the stuff bucket lists are made of. Tarnished by the Ebola crisis and long-term political instability, it is a country most people stay away from. But for travellers who like being far, far from the beaten track, Guinea has many enticements.      A land of remote hills, virgin rainforests and plunging waterfalls, this wild, West African nation is home to some mesmerising landscapes. If you like to immerse yourself in Mother Nature, you’ll love Guinea.      But don’t expect an easy time of it. The country has been mired in political instability and outbreaks of violence, and it was here that the first person died from Ebola in 2014. It is also an exceptionally poor country and beyond the capital, Conakry, it is not an easy place to travel: corruption is rife and the ubiquitous military checkpoints intimidating.      Conakry is a lot of fun, though. The city has a lively nightlife and a reasonable number of international standard restaurants serving predominantly French cuisine. Its hotel scene is hardly blazing a trail – accommodation ranges from small guesthouses to slightly run down international chains – but the city has a certain charm.      If chaotic Conakry wears you thin, hop on a ferry to Iles de Los, a small archipelago floating just off the coast. The antitheses to the bustling capital, these islands are blessed with clean sandy beaches, simple guesthouses and a relaxed vibe, which feels a world away from Conakry.      Beyond the capital Guinea is rarely visited by tourists due to the difficulty in getting around. Public transport is crowded, uncomfortable and slow, but avoids hassle from police officers, which you are likely to attract if driving your own car.      Guinea certainly isn’t for everyone, but those with a curious mind and sense of adventure will be richly rewarded.","Guinea  Attractions in Guinea  Bask on an island beach  The Îles de Los, off the Kaloum Peninsula some 10km (6 miles) southwest of Conakry, are easily accessible by boat from the capital. Good beaches can also be found at the Île de Roume and Île de Kassa. They make a popular daytrip for people escaping the city at the weekends.  Find the source of the Niger River  An expedition to the source of the Niger makes an interesting excursion from Faranah. The mighty river flows from Foroknia north to Bamako. If you want to seek the source, it's best to take a local guide on this adventure as the area is sacred to some local people and should be traversed sensitively.  Haggle for handicrafts  Not far from Conakry is the town of Kindia, renowned for its quality cloth and weaving. Visitors can stop by an indigo dyeing centre and make some purchases at the cloth market in the centre of town. In another nearby town, Katikan, open-air markets sell a range of handicrafts.  Hike in the hills  Known as the land of fruit, faith and freedom, the Fouta Djalon highlands are renowned for their picturesque hills, which offer superb views and are ideal for hiking. The highest point is Mount Loura at 1,515m (4,970ft). Mamou, a nearby town, has some good facilities and excellent street food.  Learn the secrets of the Kakimbon Caves  The Kakimbon Caves in the village of Ratoma, now a suburb of Conakry, are the source of many interesting legends and are bestowed with great religious significance by the local Baga people. With a local guide it is possible to explore the caves and learn their legends.  Party like a local in Faranah  If Guinea has a party town, it's probably Faranah. When the sun sets, this town buzzes with people frequenting the area's many cafes and restaurants. Its great mosque, villas, boulevards and markets also make this an interesting stop for visitors.  Spot some wildlife  There are no national parks in Guinea, but wildlife can be observed in the northeast savannahs between the Tinkisso River and the Mali border, in the foothills of the Fouta Djalon highlands and in the southeast of the country. Forest elephants and chimpanzees live in Guinea, but wildlife is under threat from mining, logging and the bush meat trade.  Take in some culture in the capital, Conakry  Conakry is located on the island of Tumbo and is connected to the Kaloum Peninsula by a pier. The botanical gardens, with impressive Kapok trees, are worth a visit. The Cathedral, built in the 1930s, is also well worth viewing. The National Museum, houses a collection of masks, statues and musical instruments. The Palais du Peuple is a large, Chinese-built auditorium home to two ballet troupes.  Watch a waterfall  Approximately 150km (93 miles) outside Conakry is the picturesque Le Voile de la Mariée. Amid lush vegetation the River Sabende plunges over a 70m-high (229ft) rock into a deep pond. Also worth visiting is the lofty Kinkon Falls in Pita, between Dalaba and Labé, which are most impressive in the rainy season between May and October.",africa,,
bosnia and herzegovina,"Despite a tumultuous background, Bosnia-Herzegovina has emerged as a compelling, multi-faceted travel destination. Most notable amongst the country's many charms is its lush, mountainous landscape, best seen from the vantage point of one of its national parks.      Bosnia-Herzegovina still bears the legacy of war, but there are plenty of positives to take from the country's urban centres, especially the cosmopolitan capital of Sarajevo. With its rich history and lively nightlife, this diverse city has become one of Europe's most curious, unique capitals. The old town of Sarajevo is divided between the evocative Ottoman quarter of historic mosques, little streets filled with cafes and craft workshops, and the trendy Austria-Hungarian quarter built during the late 19th century – truly a case of east meets west.      Sarajevo also has several museums explaining its history, while climbing the steep hills rewards you with a stirring view of the city. One oddity is the colossal bobsleigh track from the 1984 Winter Olympics that runs through the forests of Trebevic mountain; it was destroyed during the Siege of Sarajevo in 1990s and is now a canvas for local street artists.      Beyond Sarajevo, much of the country is relatively undeveloped, but there are several historic fortresses to see, no shortage of splendid old mosques, and a number of monasteries and Catholic shrines. The second city (at least by reputation), Mostar is also increasingly popular with tourists. Perhaps above all else, it is the city’s 16th century Ottoman bridge that symbolises both the past and a positive new beginning for the country. Destroyed during the war, it has since been painstakingly reconstructed, and was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2005.","Bosnia and Herzegovina  Attractions in Bosnia and Herzegovina  Cross Mostar Bridge  Visit Mostar to see the elegant bridge that links the two sides of the town across the Neretva River. The original 16th-century Ottoman bridge was destroyed in the 1990s conflict, but has since been reconstructed to the original specifications with Turkish help. In Mostar itself, there are also many well-preserved 16th and 17th-century mosques, medieval buildings and cobbled streets worth visiting.  Feel the history of Sarajevo  Although scarred by war, the Bosnia and Herzegovina capital is a vivacious place once more, with a great café culture and buzzing nightlife. The Ottoman quarter is particularly pretty with its historic mosques and timeworn monuments strewn about aged lanes and bazaars. The history is fascinating, too: visit the site where Franz Ferdinand was assassinated, an event that sparked WWI, and learn about the terrible Bosnian War in the Tunnel Museum and Sarajevo History Museum.  Get the popcorn out for Sarajevo Film Festival  Pop along to the Sarajevo Film Festival, the most popular of all Sarajevo's festivals, which is held annually in August. The jamboree showcases movies from mostly Balkan countries and consistently unearths films of an excellent artistic standard.  Go rafting near Bihac  See what was historically the westernmost Muslim settlement in Europe, the Bihac pocket in northwestern Bosnia and Herzegovina, close to the Croatian border. As well as being home to the Fathija Mosque, formerly a church, the town is also a superb base for rafting on the Una River.  Hike the hillscapes  Bosnia and Herzegovina's undulating landscape provides numerous hill-walking opportunities, although it is imperative to avoid areas where landmines still pose a threat. Bjelasnica Mountain offers the potential for combined hiking, rafting and village tourism. The hills around Sarajevo are also worth trekking into, home as they are to the ruined remains of the bobsled track used in the 1984 Winter Olympics.  Hit Bosnia's only beach  For Bosnia and Herzegovina's only beach, head to Neum. The tiny, solitary stretch of coast that divides Croatia's seashore is nevertheless beautiful, with golden sands and emerald waters courtesy of the fabled Adriatic Sea. Climb the hills for incredible views of the Neum corridor, a narrow dagger of sea slicing into the Dalmatian coast.  Marvel at Bosnian nature in Sutjeska National Park  Don't miss the wildlife and unspoiled beauty of Sutjeska National Park. This nature reserve boasts both Maglic Mountain – at 2,368m (7,769ft), the highest point in Bosnia and Herzegovina – and Perucica Forest, one of the last remaining primeval forests in Europe.  Pilgrimage to Medjugorje  On of Europe's most visited Catholic shrines, Medjugorje, south of Mostar, is where many claim to have seen apparitions of the Virgin Mary. Consequently, hundreds of thousands of pilgrims make their way to this holy town, which sits near the border with Croatia.  Revel at the Winter Festival  The Winter Festival in Sarajevo (usually held in February or March) is an arts festival established long before the war in the 1990s and, indeed, was determinedly held every year during the siege (the festival is usually bi-annual). The cultural festival is a two-month celebration of diversity and talent through assorted performances and workshops.  Ride the rivers  Go white-water rafting along one of the country's many mountain rivers. Rafting tours are available along the Neretva, Una and Tara rivers, which offer some of the most exciting locations in Europe for this activity. Kayaking is another water sport for which Bosnia and Herzegovina offers great potential.  See the Dervish house of Blagaj  Near Mostar, Blagaj is one of the prettiest sights in Bosnia and Herzegovina. With dramatic cliffs, turquoise waterways and mysterious caves, this peaceful village is a feast for the eyes, though the main attraction is the old Dervish house, which looms perilously over the river at the foot of a 200m-high rock face. Blagaj lies just a half-day trip from Mostar.  Visit Bosnia's second city, Banja Luka  Although most visitors to Bosnia make a beeline for Sarajevo, Banja Luka is definitely worth a visit. The country's second largest city is a hilly, picturesque town with a pleasant snaking river that's lined by many cafes, and willows dipping into the waters. Also check out the Ottoman fortress, originally Roman, and choose between several Orthodox monasteries.",europe,,
iraq,"Iraq may be synonymous with strife, a land of dusty, dubious conflicts, but what you don’t see in the mainstream media are the country’s many attributes: its fantastic birdlife, shimmering oases, turquoise rivers, fertile valleys, UNESCO World Heritage Sites and stunning cityscapes. Some of the world’s oldest societies came out of this ancient land and many refer to the region as the ‘cradle of civilisation.’      But despite its glorious past, the country has little to celebrate at present. Most of Iraq’s political, social, physical and economic infrastructures were destroyed by the US-led invasion in 2003. Successful elections and the withdrawal of troops in 2009 seemed to herald Iraq’s road to recovery and there were reasons to be optimistic: despite continuing violence, tourism had climbed back up to an impressive two million people a year by 2013 and plans were afoot to increase that number threefold.      The government even announced that it would restore the Arch of Ctesiphon, the world’s biggest arch made of bricks, and what remains of the ancient Persian capital of the same name. Also revealed were plans to repair the damage done to the southern marshes, which Sadam Hussein drained, and use its status as a bird haven to create a centre for eco-tourism.      Since 2013, though, the security situation has rapidly deteriorated, culminating with the Islamic militant group ISIS seizing large swathes of territory in the north in 2014. The Iraqi government has since pushed back against the insurgency, but the situation remains highly volatile with no end in sight.      Despite government warnings to avoid travelling to the country, a few adventure tour companies are still taking small groups to Iraq, albeit not the north. If and when the country finally stabilises, there’s little doubt that tourists will return in greater numbers to the ‘cradle of civilisation’. But until then, travel to Iraq is strongly advised against.","Iraq  Attractions in Iraq  Admire the Al-Kadhimiya Mosque  Marvel at the elaborate Al-Kadhimiya Mosque in Baghdad – one of the most important religious shrines in Iraq. This spectacular building has four gold-coated minarets and two domes. The current building dates back to the Ottomans in 1515 AD, although the original shrine is dated to the 8th century. Unfortunately, in recent years the site has been the target of numerous terrorist attacks.  Be amazed by the Islamic architecture of Karbala  Join the pilgrims travelling to Karbala, 100 km south of Baghdad. It's the spiritual home of Shi'ia Muslims who make pilgrimages to the impressive mosque housing the shrine of Hussein. The monuments there are amongst some of the finest in the Islamic world.  Be in awe of the ancient city of Ur  The ancient Sumerian city of Ur is one of the most impressive archaeological sites in Iraq, with its earliest buildings dating back to around 21st century BC. Archaeological excavations have revealed the remains of the Great Ziggurat, one of the most breath-taking structures of the ancient world.  Cruise through The Marshes  The Marshes are situated along the Shatt El-Arab waterway and are best explored by boat to experience the locals who live on man-made islands in beautiful dwellings woven in latticework from reeds.  Enter the Kurdistan capital of Erbil  Erbil is the capital and seat of the Kurdistan Regional Government in Northern Iraq. In strolling the city, you will be treading in the footsteps of Alexander the Great who defeated Darius III in the battle of Gaugamela here. The Erbil Museum marks this battle and houses a collection of Sumerian and Abbasid artefacts.  Explore Iraq's past at the National Museum  The Iraq National Museum finally reopened in 2015 after 12 years of not being opened due to a looting during the US invasions. The wealth of archaeological artefacts brings the ancient world of the Babylon to life, and is almost unrivalled in the region.  Explore the pretty canals of Basra  Once called the ""Venice of the East"", Basra's canals are lined with elegant 19th-century houses. Have a stroll on the lush island across from the Shatt Al-Arab Hotel where families picnic Basra remains the main seaport for large commercial ships and tankers as well as traditional dhows.  Explore the ruins of Babylon  An hour south of Baghdad is the historical site of Babylon and its legendary Hanging Gardens. Dating back to around 2300 BC, Babylon was a political and religious centre over several successive empires, the peak of which was the reign of Nebuchadnezzar II. Unfortunately, not much remains of the glorious palaces and temples of ancient Babylon.  Haggle in the Baghdad Bazaars  After being a no-go area for some years, the famous city bazaars have started to come to life again. Head to the colourful bird market Souk al-Ghazal and observe the famed pigeon fanciers buy birds, exchange tips and relax at local cafés.  Marvel at the Arch of Ctesiphon  Sitting east of Baghdad along the Tigris River, the Arch of Ctesiphon is built of mud brick and is probably the most spectacular archaeological remnant of a city that was captured variously through the century by the Romans, Byzantine Empire, Parthians and Sassanians. Erected in the 6th century, it was a remarkable feat of engineering for its time.  Relax in the Kurdish mountains  The foothills and mountains ring every town in Iraqi Kurdistan and in the spring and summer they are cool and beautiful places to escape the heat and dust of the towns. In the new Korek Mountain Resort, it's even possible to go skiing.  Sample Baghdad's glory days at Abbasid Palace  Overlooking the Tigris River, the Abbasid Palace is one of the finest surviving examples of 13th century Baghdad. It is one of the oldest buildings in the city, representing a period when Baghdad was a centre of education as well as trade.  See Assyrian bas-reliefs in Ninevah  If Mosul becomes accessible once more, it's essential to visit the bas-reliefs of Ninevah, the third capital of Assyria. Located on the Tigris River in the suburbs of modern Mosul, Nineveh was a centre of worship for the goddess Ishtar, an Assyrian capital and reached its height around 700 BC.  See the golden dome of Najaf  Najaf - air distance is about 146km; driving distance is about 190km - south of Baghdad, is another of the Shi'ia holy cities and famous for the mosque of Al-Haidariya, crowned with a resplendent golden dome made of gold tiles and minarets each made of 40,000 gold tiles. There are few more stunning sights in the Middle East.  See the pre-Islamic wonders of Mosul  At the time of writing, Mosul is under the control of Islamic State, but if the town becomes accessible again, you can visit the ruined city of Nineveh, while many pre-Islamic artefacts can be found in the Mosul Museum. Wander through the old city and explore mosques, churches and castles. The centre of town is famous for narrow streets of beautiful 19th century houses.  Visit The Green Zone  Don't miss visiting the vast fortified zone in the centre of Baghdad. You'll find various Iraqi government ministries in this heavily guarded area, as well as Western embassies and several ostentatious palaces, notably the Republican Palace, built by Saddam and his family.  Wander the early Islamic ruins of Samarra  Designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2007 due to its well-preserved ruins and history, Samarra represented the power of the vast Abbasid Empire. The 9th century Great Mosque and minaret are some of the most impressive early Islamic ruins in Iraq.",middle east,,
equatorial guinea,"Perhaps best known as the inspiration for Frederick Forsyth’s coup-laden thriller The Dogs of War, the political situation of hot and humid Equatorial Guinea leaves a lot to be desired. Corruption, human rights abuses and political violence are frequently recorded, and despite huge oil wealth little has trickled down to the people, where real poverty still exists.      This means the country, which occupies a slice of mainland Africa and five offshore islands, is not set up with tourism in mind. Travel can be hard and hotel rooms both limited in number and expensive compared to neighbouring states. However, Equatorial Guinea offers a rare opportunity to experience central Africa’s colonial history and unspoiled natural beauty.      Large areas of Rio Muni, mainland Equatorial Guinea, have been set aside as protected zones. Noted internationally for their biodiversity and hiking opportunities, the country’s rainforests are the habitat of various endangered primates including mandrills, chimpanzees and gorillas, as well as forest elephants.      The capital, Malabo, lacks the frenetic energy of some cities on the continent, with nothing happening very fast. Its tranquillity and the laidback air of its people perhaps results from lying on the steamy island of Bioko. It’s atmospheric sides streets are the best place in the country to encounter the architectural splendours left by Spain’s colonial regime.      Outside the capital, Bioko Island is also the location of the crater lakes of Lago Lorento and Lago Biao. Idyllic spots for relaxation, even the least interested birdwatcher will suddenly become the most ardent ornithologist: the sheer diversity of avian wildlife is staggering.      Its natural wonders and hospitable inhabitants should have put Equatorial Guinea on the map years ago, but a reputation for political instability means this remains an untapped mine for now.","Equatorial Guinea  Attractions in Equatorial Guinea  Arena Blanca  Bask on Arena Blanca, the only white beach on Bioko Island. During the dry season, thousands of butterflies can be seen.  Bata  Take a trip to Bata, the principle town in the region of Rio Muni on the mainland.

Cascades of Moca  Check out the Cascades of Moca, Lake Biao and Lake Loreta, popular visitor destinations which are inhabited by several species of monkey.  Malabo  Explore Malabo, a small but attractive town, with pleasant Spanish colonial architecture, open plazas and a lively market.

turkmenistan,"It’s an accomplished geographer who can confidently point to Turkmenistan on a map. Despite being similar in size to Spain, this Central Asian nation remains well under most people’s radar.      There are two reasons for this. One is that Turkmenistan is a country comprised largely of barren desert and untamed terrain – hardly a big draw for tourists. But the main reason for its obscurity can be traced to Turkmenistan’s autocratic government, which has been compared to the regime of North Korea.      At the helm of this ex-Soviet state is President Berdymukhamedov, who promotes a Kim Jong-un style personality cult in which he and his inner circle enjoy absolute power over every aspect of life. Consequently, according to Human Rights Watch, Turkmenistan is one of the most repressed countries in the world, a place where ""human rights defenders and other activists face the constant threat of government reprisals.”      If you’re not put off by repressive regimes, Turkmenistan is a destination that offers one thing most others don’t: the chance to travel across the country without seeing other travellers. The isolation is palpable.      The brave few who do make it here usually arrive via the capital, Ashgabat. This modern city was built in 1948 after an earthquake destroyed the previous incarnation. Visitors can learn more about this devastating event at the touching Earthquake Museum, one of the city’s finer attractions.      Many of Ashgabat’s other landmarks take on a Soviet flavour – Independence Square, the Arch of Neutrality, numerous Lenin statues – but there are also mosques, galleries and gardens. The Altyn Asyr bazaar is worth a visit too, especially if you’re in the market for a Turkmen carpet.      Outside the capital, almost all of the country’s attractions lie around the fringes of the desert. Some of the world’s most powerful empires settled here and their crumbling legacies can be seen at the Parthian Fortress of Nisa, Kunya-Urgench and Merv, which are all UNESCO-listed World Heritage Sites. And quiet ones at that.","Turkmenistan  Attractions in Turkmenistan  Bathe in an underground lake, Bakharden  Take a day trip to Bakharden, 90km (56 miles) west of Ashgabat. The underground mineral lake (known in Turkmen as Kov Ata, which means ""father of lakes"") is fed by hot springs and has a constant temperature of 37°C (97°F). Bathing is permitted although there is an admission fee. Accommodation is not available.  Climb the cooler climes of Chuli Valley  Enjoy the natural splendour of the Chuli Valley, a popular mountain resort. Accessible by taxi or private car, the drive takes you through a picturesque gorge and up to the cooler air. Visitors hoping to hike and climb can do so by arrangement, and there is even the opportunity to stay here.  Enjoy a day at the races  Spend a day at the races: in spring and autumn, horse races are held at the Hippodrome in Ashgabat. A colourful spectacle of speed and agility, there is no public betting. For those wishing to get closer to the stallions, 10km (6 miles) south of Ashgabat is the national Turkmenbashi Stud Farm where the Akhal-Teke horses are bred.  Explore the remains of Anau's famous mosque  See the ruins of the famous mosque, revered for its striking mosaic tiles and 8m-long (26ft) dragons, at the modern town of Anau. Once the site of the destroyed 15th-century city (whose fortress watchtowers can still be seen today), Anau is a short drive, 20km (12 miles) east of Ashgabat.  Marvel at the Arch of Neutrality, Ashgabat  The Turkmenistan capital stands on the southern rim of the Kara-Kum desert. Visit to see magnificent white marble Palace of Turkmenbashi, take in the museums, including the carpet museum and the National Museum of Turkmenistan, and hit the viewing platform of the Arch of Neutrality, a 75m- high (246ft) monument with a revolving golden statue of the late President Niyazov.  Miss Mary and make to Merv  Mary is Turkmenistan's second city and other than its Regional Museum there is little to recommend here. However, it lies near the remains of the city of Merv, which was once the second city of Islam. Known as the ""Queen of Cities"", what survives are brick-built mausolea of rulers and holy men – including the impressive Mausoleum of Sultan Sanjar from 1140.  Revel in the ruins outside Dashgouz  Dashgouz is the largest city in the northern region of Turkmenistan. The main sights are outside the city but include: the ruins of Konye-Urgench, an ancient fortress town with 14th-century relics; Kutlug Timur Minaret, one of the tallest minarets in Asia at 67m (220ft); and the mausoleums of Sultan Tekesh, Turabeg Khanym and Najm-ed-din Kubra.  Swim in the Caspian Sea at Turkmenbashi  Situated on the shores of the Caspian Sea, Turkmenbashi (formerly Krasnovodsk) was a Russian creation. Built as a bridgehead for the campaign to subdue Central Asia, it later became the terminal for the Trans-Caspian Railway. Today visitors can enjoy panoramic mountainside views, good beaches and swimming, while the Museum of Regional History and Natural History makes an interesting stop.  Take a tour of the Silk Road  Uncover the delights of the Silk Road, the ancient trading route used by silk merchants from the 2nd century AD until its decline in the 14th century. The Tolkuchka Market in Ashgabat, the historical cities of Konye-Urgench and Merv (especially the windowless Kyz-Kala castle) and Kugitang Nature Reserve's dinosaur footprints are among the must-sees along the road. An organised tour is advised.  Trail the countryside on horseback  Turkmenistan is home to the Akhal-Teke horse, a special breed known for its speed and intelligence. They occupy a special place in Turkmen culture and are a source of great national pride. Saddle up just outside Ashgabat, to ride through the gorges of the Firuza River and to the local hot springs. Rides can be arranged through local tour operators.  Visit the UNESCO-listed fortresses of Old Nisa  Discover the remains of Old Nisa, the capital of the Parthian kings who ruled from the 3rd century BC to the 3rd century AD. Overseeing an Empire that included Iraq and stretched as far as the Syrian Arab Republic, their might, which prevented the Roman Empire from progressing east, can be seen in the UNESCO-listed fortresses of Nisa.",asia,,
dominican republic,"Dominican Republic is ensconced as the Caribbean’s most visited destination. It’s not hard to see why; a seemingly endless spread of white-sandy beaches and palm trees play host to a similarly sizeable range of holiday resorts. The country has developed a reputation for a good-quality break at a reasonable price, for what it’s worth.      With its 32km (20 miles) stretch of beaches and clear blue sea, the region around Punta Cana on the east coast is particularly popular, offering golf courses, all-inclusive holidays and the usual fun-in-the-sun trappings.      Dominican Republic makes up one half of the island of Hispaniola – which it shares with Haiti in the west. The country is one of the most geographically diverse parts of the Caribbean, showcasing everything from tropical rainforests and high-mountain ranges to mangrove swamps and semi-deserts. Mountain-bikers, windsurfers, hikers, climbers and even whale-watchers are well catered for.      No less notably, however, the Dominican Republic is heaving with life, blending the heady rhythms of merengue and bachata music, with a fondness for rum and religion, not to mention a near-unrivalled passion for baseball.      The country has a long history. It was the first part of the region to be discovered by Christopher Columbus in 1492. A visit to capital city Santo Domingo still makes the most natural starting point for cultural visitors. The oldest fortress Fortaleza Ozama (built in 1502) and colonial-era churches still stand proud, while the city as a whole is a thrusting, energetic destination full of speaker-blaring corner stores and dance-till-you-drop nightclubs.      While it’s a large country by Caribbean standards, it remains relatively easy to combine different elements of the destination in one itinerary. And whether you’re here for the beaches, the music, the countryside or the culture, the DR in full swing is a force to be reckoned with.","Dominican Republic  Attractions in Dominican Republic  Be dazzled by the Columbus Lighthouse  This colossal cross-shaped monument to Christopher Columbus on the south coast was built to commemorate the 500th anniversary of the discovery of South America. It projects a cross-shaped beam of light into the sky, visible from as far as neighbouring Puerto Rico. Today, you can visit the 'lighthouse', which doubles as a museum, whose exhibits include a sarcophagus supposedly containing Columbus' remains.   Catch some baseball  Affectionately known as 'pelota', baseball isn't so much the Dominican national sport as the national obsession – male and female, young and old, they're all hooked. The professional domestic season, featuring six teams from across the country, runs from mid-October through late January, providing visitors a chance to experience the game in all its glory.   Dance, dance, dance  Throw yourself into Santo Domingo's nightlife by dancing down-and-dirty to the merengue with the locals. The city's Malecón boardwalk has a number of lively options, and there are several steamy nightclubs in the Zona Colonial which offer live jazz and Latino beats.   Drop in on Columbus junior’s family home  Santo Domingo's Zona Colonial is a World Heritage Site, where you can explore some of the most historic buildings in Americas. Completed in 1514, the Alcazar de Colón was the palatial residence of Diego Columbus, son of Christopher Columbus. Equally unmissable is the Cathedral of Santa María la Menor, the oldest Cathedral in Americas, completed in 1540. The cathedral is known as Christopher Columbus' resting place, and outside stands a bronze statue of the explorer overlooking Plaza de Colon.   Go mountain biking  The country's mountainous interior makes for a great biking terrain, with the Cordillera Septentrional being a particularly popular choice. The scenic Constanza and the forested Valle Nuevo National Park are also preferred by cyclists. Specialist agencies like Iguana Mama run cycling tours to the countryside with bikes and equipment included. The best time to go mountain biking is during the dry season, from May to September.   Hit the surf at Puerto Plata  This historical northern city has an absorbing Old Town, centred around Fortaleza San Felipe, which was constructed by the Spanish as both a defensive outpost and a keep for captured smugglers. If you're looking for adrenalin action though, the nearby beaches are superb, particularly Sosua and Cabarete, whose big surf and powerful breezes create some of the world's best windsurfing and kite-boarding conditions.   Join the Carnival  The city of La Vega bursts into life on every Sunday in February for its annual carnival, El Carnaval de la Vega. This pre-Lent festival has parades featuring costumed characters including a limping devil (Diablo Cojuelo). Although La Vega is known for the carnival, other cities hosting unique parades include Santiago, Santo Domingo, Montecristi, Bonao, Puerto Plata, Río San Juan, and Barahona.   Meet the Tainos  The Museum of Dominican Man (Museo del Hombre Dominicano) is Santo Domingo's best museum, devoted to the country's anthropology. Its sculptures and artefacts offer a fascinating insight on the Tainos, the island's earliest settlers. You can also see colourful carnival costumes and masks here, as well as exhibits of the Voodoo cult religion that once dominated the Caribbean.  Mind the crocs in Lago Enriquillo  Populated by countless flocks of tropical birds (and a healthy population of crocodiles), Lago Enriquillo is an enormous saltwater lake near the Haitian border, and largest lake in the Caribbean, which you can go on boat trips to explore. Its flora and fauna are protected within a combined national park: the Jaragua-Bahoruco-Enriquillo Biosphere Reserve.   Pick up some amber  Arguably the most authentic Dominican souvenir on the market, amber is widely available at reasonable prices. The northern coastline is known for producing some of the finest amber in the world. You can visit an amber museum (www.ambermuseum.com) in Puerto Plata, or tour the mines in the hills of La Cumbre (about 43km/28m from Puerto Plata). Keep a look out for blue amber which is found only in Dominican Republic. You can purchase them raw on the mining sites and get them polished, carved and set in jewellery later. However, be mindful of fakery.  Reel in a fighting dorado  Game fishing is popular and you can ask your hotel to arrange a fishing trip for you. Top catches include mahi-mahi (between October and March), white marlin (April to June), blue marlin (July to September), and tuna and kingfish (July to August).   Soak up the views on top of Mount Isabela de Torres  Close to Puerto Plata on the north coast, Mount Isabela de Torres provides awesome views of the ocean and surrounding national parks. If you feel adventurous you can climb to the top in a few hours, if not the cable car will whisk you up in minutes from Monday to Saturday. A replica of Rio de Janeiro's Christ Redeemer statue stands on the peak; there's also a botanical garden.   Tee off  Enjoy a round of golf under the Caribbean sun. The sport is popular in the country, with luxury resorts offering challenging courses – some are even considered in the top 50 in the Caribbean. Several of the country's courses enjoy dramatic ocean-facing settings, with some of the best concentrated on the south coast, a short swing from Santo Domingo.   Watch out for whales  Jump on a whale watching boat and search for magnificent humpback whales, thousands of which make their annual winter arrival off the Samaná headland, on the northeastern tip of the island. The season for witnessing this thrilling spectacle, generally stretches from mid-January to mid-March. You can find organised boat trips in the little port of Santa Barbara de Samaná. Punta Cana is another great location to witness the beautiful humpback whales spring above the surface, in the attempt to mate with the female species. The Dominican Republic law enforces strict protection and guidelines for whales.",caribbean,,
senegal,"Senegal is often known as 'The Country of Teranga'. Teranga means hospitality in the local tongue of Wolof, and you will indeed find Senegal to be one of the friendliest spots in West Africa. The locals are hospitable - once you get to know them, you may find yourself being invited to share a steaming cup of tea or even some delicious home-cooked meals.      A simple wander around the local markets will unearth handmade fabrics and authentic arts and crafts, while on almost every street corner in the towns and cities you'll find musicians full of energy. It is also worth checking out bustling restaurants that serve up rich Senegalese cuisine influenced by the Maghrebis (inhabitants of northern Africa), French and Portuguese.      Most visitors land in Dakar, the chaotic, fast-growing capital, packed with great nightlife and restaurants. However, Senegal also offers beautiful, untouched rural scenery, along with golden beaches, tropical rainforests and semiarid grasslands. Suffice to say, Senegal offers something unique for every traveller.      Indeed, the diversity of Senegal is perhaps its best feature. The southern Casamance region boasts palm-fringed tropical beaches. The western region is bounded by the Atlantic Ocean, featuring a series of wetlands teeming with biodiversity, including one of the largest concentrations of migratory birds in the world. Then you have the relatively flat plains which give way to the mountainous region in the southeast – this is where the highest point of Senegal is found, reaching an elevation of 581m (1,906ft) near Népen Diakha.      Adventurous travellers come to Senegal to surf some of the best waves in West Africa in year-round warm waters, hike through lush tropical rainforest-clad mountains, discover towering waterfalls or go deep-sea fishing in the depth of the continental shelf. With birds, giraffes, elephants, hippos, rhinos, lions and panthers abound, wildlife viewing is also high on the agenda among some travellers.      Highbrow tourists won't be disappointed either. There are year-round music and art festivals such as the Saint-Louis Jazz Festival, as well as well-managed museums displaying some of the most interesting artefacts found in the region. You'll also find well-preserved colonial ruins and sites that remember the dehumanising Transatlantic slave trade.      Senegal is easily accessible from Europe and the USA. The country offers an array of experiences, has warm temperature year-round and one of the best infrastructures in the region, so it is time to put Senegal on your radar and come for a visit.","Senegal  Attractions in Senegal  Casamance  Casamance sits between the Gambia (which is a near-enclave within Senegal) and Guinea-Bissau. As the Gambia lies in between Casamance and the larger northern part of Senegal, Casamance retains a unique identity – many of its people have traditional beliefs, for instance.  Casamance, Cap Skirring  A town on the Atlantic coast, Cap Skirring sits on Senegal's southwestern corner, just a few miles north of Guinea-Bissau. Its sandy beaches and laid-back atmosphere make a fine base for tourists seeking to unwind.

Top attractions in Dakar include Musée Théodore Monod, its many colourful markets and the nearby island of Gorée.  Dakar, Musée Théodore Monod (IFAN Museum of African Arts)  Musée Théodore Monod, also known as the IFAN Museum of African Arts in Dakar, is the country's main museum. It has a collection of masks, statues, musical instruments and traditional attires from West Africa.  Dakar, Senegalese wrestling match  Senegalese wrestling (lamb ji) is hugely popular in Senegal. The stakes are high in some of these matches, with the winner taking home the equivalent of $100,000 euros or more. With so much at risk, fighters need more than physical strength. They have a marabout (spiritual guide) taking them through rituals that combine tribal dancing and traditional prayers before each match. In 2018, China built a national wrestling arena in Pikine, a suburb of Dakar, so catch a wrestling match if you're there.  La Petite Côte (Little Coast)  From south of Dakar, la Petite Côte (Little Coast) stretches for some 150km (94 miles) to la Pointe de Sangomar and is one of the major tourist destinations in Senegal. With a stunning coastline, idyllic climate and a number of good hotels, this area has become a magnet for European sun lovers.  La Petite Côte, Palmarin  Palmarin is a village on the southern stretch of Senegal's Petite Côte. To the west are the sandy beaches skirting the expanse of the Atlantic Ocean. To the east is the protected National Reserve de Palmarin, a patchwork delta consisting of mangrove channels, salt flats, grasslands and forest. This unique combination of habitat supports a wide assortment of plant and animal life.  La Petite Côte, Popenguine  Popenguine is a member of Global Ecovillage Network of Senegal (GENSEN). It is known for its natural reserve (managed by a local women's group), pristine sandy beach, and religious significance (known for the sighting of the Black Madonna).  La Petite Côte, Saly  Saly is a known base for visitors seeking sun and sea along La Petite Côte. Easily accessible from the airport in Dakar and blessed with a long stretch of golden beaches, visitors began to flock to Saly in the 1980s and since then, private villas and swanky resorts have sprung up around the area.  La Petite Côte, Toubab Dialao  Toubab Dialao is a fast becoming a cultural hub thanks to the school founded by dancer and choreographer Germaine Acogny (who is widely regarded as the mother of African contemporary dance). The beaches here are bounded by steep cliffs of red rock, considered to be a good place to catch beautiful sunsets.  Lac Rose (Lake Retba)  Lac Rose (Lake Retba) is known as the pink lake because of the unusual tint of pink that the lake displays at certain times of the year. The colour is caused by a type of bacteria which thrives in this salty lake and the pink shade is most vibrant during the dry season (November to June). The locals also farm salt here.  Lac de Guiers  The only freshwater lake in Senegal, Lac de Guiers attracts visitors for its wealth of birdlife, particularly waterbirds such as herons, egrets, spoonbills and ibises.  L’île de Gorée (Gorée Island)  Just off the coast of Dakar, L’île de Gorée was once the largest slave-trading centre on the African coast. Now a World Heritage Site and a pilgrimage destination for the African diaspora, the island has played host to many world leaders including President Mandela and President Obama.

Created in 1971, the park extends over 16,000 hectares (39,500 acres) and is an important bird sanctuary, attracting more than 1.5 million migratory birds. Between November and April, thousands of birdwatchers visit this place, finding a spot in one of the watchtowers to observe birds in spectacular numbers.  Parc National du Delta du Saloum  Formed by the arms of three rivers, Parc National du Delta du Saloum is a network of channels surrounding over 200 islands and islets, mangroves and dry forest. One of the most remarkable features is its 218 shellfish mounds created by its inhabitants over the ages. Some of these mounds were burial sites.  Parc National du Niokolo-Koba  A World Heritage Site, Parc National du Niokolo Koba covers nearly one million hectares (2.4 million acres) and is rich in wildlife. Derby elands (largest of the antelopes), chimpanzees, lions, leopards, elephants all thrive here, but poaching, bush fires, and other human activities continue to be a threat. Its wetlands are also home to many species of birds, reptiles and amphibians. The park is about 560km (348 miles) southeast of Dakar.  Saint-Louis  Founded in 1659, Saint-Louis was the oldest city on the western African coast and was the capital of Senegal from 1872 to 1957.

oregon,"Oregon doesn’t have to try hard: it has one of the hippest cities on the planet, snow-tipped volcanoes, a phenomenal coastline and more breweries per capita than any other US state.      Portland (aka ‘Beervana’) practically invented hip and might as well have invented beer too. While other cities are just cottoning on to this microbrewery malarkey, Portland has been blending wheaty concoctions since the 1980s. With more breweries than any other city on Earth, plus tasting rooms, brew ‘n’ view cinemas and cracking beer festivals, you’re never likely to be without a hoppy ale in hand.

mallorca,"It doesn’t take a genius to work out why Mallorca endures as one of Europe’s top destinations. Clean beaches? Check. Upmarket resorts? Check. Reliable weather? Check. It has all the hallmarks of a sizzling summer holiday.      Resorts big and small can be found along much of the coast, offering everything from tranquil getaways to raucous fun in the sun. Mega yachts, small sailboats and wooden fishing boats ply the waters around the island.      But Mallorca is more than just a beach destination. In recent years the island’s capital, Palma, has developed into one of Spain’s most beguiling small cities. Fronted by the beautifully imposing cathedral and royal palace, its narrow cobbled lanes weave away from the seafront into the heart of the old city, where pedestrianised shopping streets, charming squares, ancient courtyards and chic bars attract locals and foreigners alike. As well as its vibrant nightlife, Palma boasts a strong arts scene.      Excellent food abounds in Mallorca. Seafood predominates in coastal resorts, while regional dishes are served in traditional restaurants throughout the island. The restaurant scene is thriving in Palma, where foodies can quaff anything from local cuisine to Japanese fare.      Head inland and a completely different (and much less touristy) picture of Mallorca emerges. Traditional villages lie scattered across the countryside, sheep bells tinkle, white almond blossom floats in the air and a rural tranquillity prevails.      The central plain is the agricultural heart of the island, with vineyards, sleepy hamlets and weekly markets. Along the west coast, the great Sierra de Tramuntana mountains, covered in pine forests, tower over the plains, their sharp cliffs looming large above the deep blue sea. It’s the Spain of yesteryear and it should not be missed.","Mallorca  Attractions in Mallorca  Admire the palimpsest Palau de l'Almudaina  Originally home to Mallorca's Moorish rulers and expanded for the Catalan kings, the ""palace of the citadel"" in Palma is a graceful mix of Moorish, Gothic and Renaissance styles. It was an official island residence of King Juan Carlos I before his abdication in 2015. The gardens and fountains are beautiful.  Ascend to Castell de Bellver for an unbeatable view  This unusual, round, 14th-century castle surrounded by forests and paths offers breath-taking views of Palma de Mallorca. Formerly a royal residence it now houses an excellent museum, including a collection of classical sculptures. The castle is located on a hill above the city and is a major feature of Palma's skyline.  Browse Inca Market  Weekly town markets are an important part of Mallorcan life, and Inca's market is one of the biggest. Stalls fill the town centre where everything from toys to flowers to fruit and vegetables are sold. It's most famous for its leather goods including wallets, belts, bags and shoes.  Cap de Formentor  At Mallorca's easternmost pinnacle lies the Formentor cape, one of the most picturesque parts of the island. Tall cliffs dip into deep blue seas, sporadic pine trees grow along its shore and seabirds swoop overhead. A winding road weaves along the coast here, providing the most spectacular views.  Climb the La Sierra de Tramuntana  La Sierra de Tramuntana Mountains run ragged across Mallorca's northern coast, offering scintillating views and challenging bike rides, with a diverse mix of calas and rocky outcrops dotted along the way. Steep cliffs drop into the blue sea below and picturesque villages such as Deiá perch on the mountainsides.  Explore Palma de Mallorca's old town  The long and multi-faceted history of Palma is well preserved by its old city, where cobbled streets, stout city walls, grand courtyards and gothic buildings beg to be explored. Busy shopping streets, grand squares, pavement cafés, chic restaurants, trendy bars and a flourishing art scene bustle with locals and tourists alike.  Explore the idyllic village of Valldemosa  Tucked high in the Tramuntana Mountains is the quaint, cobbled-lane village of Valldemosa. At its heart is the medieval Royal Monastery complex (the Real Cartoixa), which is associated with the French writer George Sand and composer Frédéric Chopin, who shared a room here in 1838-39. It's a magical little town in a beautiful setting.  Get a taste of farm life at La Granja  This rural finca (farm) in the mountains is surrounded by tranquil gardens and has been beautifully preserved to show a traditional Mallorcan working farm. La Granja hosts craft demonstrations and folk dancing (Wednesday and Friday afternoons). There are also displays of antique furnishings, costumes, food tasting and farm animals.  Go on pilgrimage to Santuari de Lluc  High up in the Tramuntana Mountains is Lluc monastery, Mallorca's most famous pilgrimage destination. Since the 13th century, pious Catholics and others have made their way here to pay homage to La Moreneta, ""the little dark one"", a statue of the Virgin Mary. There is also a simple but unique hostel inside the monastery.  Hit the dancefloor  Although the Balearic Islands have started to move on from their party image in recent years, they still attract many visitors keen on irreverent nightlife. There are several ""super clubs"" in Mallorca, many of them in Palma's trendy Paseo Maritimo district. And if all else fails, there's always Magaluf.  Pay homage to Robert Graves  One of Britain's most famous war poets, after a tumultuous life in the trenches – and a somewhat colourful life in London – the venerable writer moved to Deiá, a sleepy Mallorcan village where he wrote his most celebrated works. Fans can explore his rambling villa, which is home to a small but informative museum, and visit the late poet's grave in the nearby cemetery.  Practice watersports around the island  The crystal waters encircling Mallorca are perfect for sports. The island is a popular yachting destination, while the warm sea is ideal for swimming, snorkelling, diving or kayaking. Day boat cruises are a great way to see the coast and there are many excursions that can be booked locally.  Ride the Palma Sóller Railway  The Palma Sóller Railway is the best way to get to the charming, traditional town of Sóller, nestled amongst the Tramuntana Mountains. The vintage wooden 1912 locomotive makes a scenic 27km (16.7 miles) trip through mountains, forests and olive and orange groves offering spectacular scenic views of rural Mallorca.  Visit S 'Albufera Nature Reserve  S 'Albufera Nature Reserve in Alcúdia bay is a large tranquil area of marshy coastline formed by lakes, and natural and artificial canals. The park is home to 200 species of bird, a huge variety of plants and wildflowers, insects, fish, and some unusual amphibians, reptiles and mammals.  Walk into a fairy-tale at Cuevas del Drach  Walk through the fairy-tale world of the ""dragon's cave"" on the island's northeast coast. You'll pass fantastically shaped stalagmites, beneath a million needle-shaped stalactites, before reaching an amphitheatre for the grand climax – an unforgettable classical concert on an underground lake. The tour is guided in several languages.  Wander dozens of beaches and coves  Mallorca's coastline is pocketed with natural coves, whose clear sparkling waters attract sailboats, traditional fishing boats and are perfect for swimming in. Of these Cala Pi, Cala D'Or and Sa Calobra are particularly beautiful. Golden beaches can be found all around the island. Some especially attractive ones are Es Trenc, Alcúdia and Sa Coma.  Wonder at the astonishing Palma Cathedral  The cathedral is a splendid example of Gothic architecture, remarkable for its vast size and stained glass windows. Construction began 1306 and continued for four centuries. It was remodelled by Gaudí from 1902 to 1914. Beautifully illuminated at night, the cathedral is Palma de Mallorca's most famous landmark.",europe,spain,balearic islands
democratic republic of congo,"The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is one of the largest and most enigmatic countries in Africa. It has many beautiful landscapes, mainly comprising dense and undulating rainforest interspersed with waterfalls and teeming with fascinating wildlife.      The great body of the Congo River runs across the northern reaches of the country and has long been a site of considerable historic importance, made famous by the explorer Henry Morton Stanley and later used as the backdrop for Joseph Conrad’s Heart of Darkness.      In many ways, much of the DRC remains as wild and impenetrable today as it would have been in Conrad’s time. The transport infrastructure built by the brutal Belgian colonial regime has largely been reclaimed by the jungle and there are few links between the country’s vast interior and the urban areas dotted around its fringes.      Kinshasa, the capital, is situated in the far west of the country and, though largely impoverished and crumbling, it is a veritable hub for colourful African music and culture.      DRC’s tourist capital, if such a thing exists, is Goma, which sits on the banks of Lake Kivu in the far east of the country. It is presided over by the imposing Nyiragongo volcano, which sits at the heart of Virunga National Park, the oldest national park in Africa and one of just a handful of places where you can still see mountain gorillas in their natural habitat.      Goma and the mineral-rich Kivu region were hit particularly hard by a civil war from 1998 to 2003 that resulted in the deaths of at least three million people; sporadic bouts of violence since the war officially ended have continued to burden the region’s considerable tourist potential.      However, peace and a semblance of stability have returned to Goma for the time being and small handfuls of adventurous tourists are beginning to trickle across the border once again. Visitors are advised to check the latest travel advice before visiting.","Democratic Republic of Congo  Attractions in Democratic Republic of Congo  Discover Upemba National Park  Upemba National Park straddles the River Lualaba and is accessible from the towns of Lubumbashi and Kolwezi. It includes several lakes and picturesque riverine sections inhabited by hippos, crocodiles and aquatic birds. Wildlife stocks were previously decimated by poachers and militias but are slowly returning with the help of the Frankfurt Zoological Society. For now, this beautiful park remains tantalizingly tourism free.  Experience the beauty of Bukavu  The beautiful, verdant town of Bukavu hugs the southern tip of Lake Kivu and serves as a departure point for the under-visited Kahuzi-Biega National Park and Idjwi Island. The former is home to eastern lowland gorillas and some great hiking; the latter is the second-largest lake island in Africa and a perfect spot for a few days peaceful relaxation.  Explore Inkisi Falls  In the southwest, the Inkisi Falls (60m/197ft high) and the massive complex of caves that wrap around them may be visited in one day, but many visitors stay for two or three days at the pleasant resort in the town of Mbanza-Ngungu. The impressive falls are an easy hike from the resort and 130km (80 miles) by road from the capital city Kinshasa.  Feel the pulse of Kinshasa  Kinshasa is a crazy and sometimes scary place. Not for the faint of heart, this sprawling city on the banks of the mighty Congo River has some great nightlife, cultural offerings and music. If the chaos of the capital gets too much, on its fringes there's an equatorial forest surrounding a beautiful lake called Ma Vallée with a tavern on its banks.  Get to know Garamba National Park  A UNESCO World Heritage Site, this remote national park in the northeast of DRC boasts a staggering array of habitats, from open undulating savannah grasslands to dense rainforests. Managed by African Parks since 2005, Garamba was once home to the last population of wild northern white rhinoceros and still boasts large elephant, hippo and giraffe populations.  Hang out with bonobos at Lolo Ya Sanctuary  Just 90 minutes outside of Kinshasa, this sanctuary provides a home for orphaned bonobos. These inherently peaceful primates, who resemble chimpanzees, are incredibly intelligent and known for solving most of their problems with sex. There are various trails through their forested enclosures, but you're just as likely to find these loving creatures hanging around by the main building.  See the resurgence of Goma  On the northern shore of Lake Kivu, Goma has been at the centre of the various wars that have engulfed the wider region. As a result, it's had to become a master of reinvention. It's the DRC's tourism capital, if such a thing exists, and the main access point to Virunga National Park. It's also got a surprisingly lively and youthful arts scene.  Track Gorillas in Virunga National Park  Virunga National Park is Africa's oldest national park. It comprises two jagged mountain ranges and game that includes lions, elephants, buffaloes, hippos and numerous antelope species. Best of all, this park is renowned for its mountain gorillas. Track these incredible creatures through the dense forest and then peer into an active lava lake from the top of Nyiragongo volcano.  Visit likeable Lubumbashi  Lubumbashi is the capital city of the mineral rich Katanga Province and DRC's primary economic hub. It's the country's most diverse city, and has the best infrastructure, as well as good travel connections with the wider region. But it's also a pleasant place to explore for a couple of days, with some fine Belgian architecture and good restaurants and accommodation options.  Wander around Kalemie  Enjoy the Democratic Republic of Congo's areas of watery beauty from the pretty and laidback town of Kalemie on the banks of the immense Lake Tanganyika. The town has a functioning airport to connect with the wider region and Tanzania across the border. There's also some fascinating, crumbling colonial architecture, colourful markets and pleasant accommodations with great lake views.",africa,,
montserrat,"Montserrat is a quiet, laid-back island where you can hike, birdwatch, snorkel, or enjoy a couple of drinks over a game of dominoes.      The tiny Caribbean island was dealt a devastating blow when the Soufrière Hills volcano erupted massively in 1995 and again in 1997. Almost half the island was rendered uninhabitable, including the capital, Plymouth, which today stands half-submerged in volcanic ash and mud. The effects were not limited to physical destruction. Montserrat's economy was severely damaged, and around two-thirds of the 12,000 population left the island.      The volcano remains active and much of the island is still out of bounds, but this in itself is a draw for tourists looking for something beyond the usual Caribbean experience of beaches and luxury resorts.","Montserrat  Attractions in Montserrat  Do a jig and celebrate St Patrick's Week  This exotic destination is known as the Emerald Isle of the Caribbean and is the only country outside of Ireland to make St Patrick's Day a public holiday. Join in the festivities during St Patrick's Week, which commemorates Montserrat's slave uprising on 17 March 1768, as well as celebrating the island's Irish heritage.  Explore the uunderwater world  Duck underwater with a snorkel and mask or plunge deeper with full scuba gear. Montserrat's reefs are teeming with colourful coral and fish that include reef sharks, sea turtles, parrotfish and plenty of colourful coral. There are several major dive centres located on the island.  Lace up your hiking boots  There are plenty of hiking trails that criss-cross Montserrat and make it perfect to explore on foot. Popular routes are the Cot trail (which runs through an oki banana plantation to a historic family house), Runaway Ghaut, the Blackwood Allen trail, and the Silver Hills trail (which passes through one of the island's oldest volcanic centres).  Make a date at Rendezvous Bay  Travel by boat to Rendezvous Bay and enjoy the only white sandy beach in Montserrat; sand in the other bays is of volcanic origin and may be grey or black. You could also hire a fishing boat and try your luck at catching marlin, wahoo or tuna.  Picnic at the Oriole Complex  Trace Montserrat's history at the Oriole Complex, and take a guided tour of the gardens. The accompanying pastry barn is also the perfect place to stock up with some treats before heading to the gardens for a lazy picnic.  See the active Soufrière Hills Volcano  Take the opportunity to see an active volcano, and the devastation caused by the 1997 eruption, from the viewing platform on Jack Boy Hill. After centuries of dormancy, the Soufriere Hills volcano became active in 1995 and continues to sporadically erupt. The volcano takes its name from the French word soufriere, meaning sulphur outlet.  Spend the day birdwatching  Make your way to Pelican Point on the east coast, home to the island's only breeding colony of the spectacular frigate birds. Look out for the icterus oberi (a species of oriole), Montserrat's national bird, at Centre and Silver Hill in the north of the island.  Take a boat tour of the island  One of the best ways to get the measure of Montserrat is to take a boat tour around the island. A view from the sea allows you to observe the Soufrière Hills Volcano, the Tar River Delta and the remnants of the old W H Bramble Airport.  Tour the Montserrat Volcano Observatory  Meet the scientists monitoring volcanic activity at the Montserrat Volcano Observatory. Twice a week (Tuesdays and Thursdays), they take visitors on a tour of the facility. The activities at the observatory also include research, education and advising on the active Soufriere Hills volcano.  Watch a local football match  Time your trip to coincide with a friendly football match between the Montserrat national side and a visiting European team. Football is the second most popular sport in Montserrat after cricket. Nicknamed ""The Emerald Boys"", the team play at the Blakes Estate Stadium near the village of Look Out.  Witness the vanishing town of Plymouth  From Richmond Hill, cast your eye over the deserted capital, Plymouth. The town now lies buried in ash, vanishing a little more each year as mudflows and volcanic debris mount up. The town was swamped by volcanic eruptions in 1995 and 1997 and promptly abandoned.",caribbean,,
ecuador,"Tiny by South American standards, Ecuador is packed with an amazing range of natural and cultural attractions; a microcosm of everything that is appealing about this fascinating continent. Tucked between Colombia and Peru, Ecuador outdoes its heavyweight neighbours because of, rather than despite, its size. In a single day you could take an early morning safari in the Amazon, drive up through a valley of active volcanoes and past verdant cloud forest before winding down to the Pacific coast in time for a seafood dinner.      Bisected by the equator (hence the name), Ecuador is divided into three distinct regions – Costa, Sierra and Oriente. The coast, or Costa, is hot and dry with sandy beaches, rolling surf and lively Afro-Ecuadorian towns. The mountainous centre, or Sierra, is a place of snow-capped Andean peaks, colonial towns and vibrant local markets. And the tropical lowland, the Oriente, which takes in parts of the Amazon, is home to innumerable species of wildlife and indigenous inhabitants. In addition, Ecuador controls the Galapagos Islands, a wildlife-rich archipelago in the Pacific Ocean, where Charles Darwin developed his theory of evolution.      At the heart of all this is Quito. As well as laying claim to being the world’s second highest capital city (after La Paz in Bolivia) this lofty metropolis has the best-preserved historic centre in Latin America, not to mention an excellent culinary scene, vibrant nightlife and string of world-class cultural attractions.      However, it’s Ecuador’s natural beauty that draws in the crowds. Visitors flock from around the world to admire the wildlife, particularly on the Galapagos Islands, which is home to giant tortoises, whale sharks, sea lions and many more. For those seeking an adrenalin hit, world-renowned scuba diving, exceptional trekking and breathtaking climbing is rarely far away. Whether you explore it on two wheels or four hooves; on a raft, kayak or surfboard, Ecuador is a joy to get to know.","Ecuador  Attractions in Ecuador  All aboard Tren Crucero  Ecuador's railways fell out of favour in the 1970s as the country's inhabitants took the roads. However, train travel has been enjoying a renaissance since 2012, when a £183million project to reopen the country's ancient railways was completed. The flagship service is Tren Crucero, a luxury tourist train that wends its way from the lofty capital, Quito, to the coastal city of Guayaquil via the infamous Devil's Nose.  Bathe in Baños  This tourist resort is booming despite having been several times evacuated because of its violent neighbour – the permanently erupting Tungurahua volcano. At night you can watch the mountain exhale fumes and lava, and during the day you can slip into one of the thermal baths, shower beneath a waterfall, take a hike or saddle up and ride through the forest.  Climb Cotopaxi  Cotopaxi is one of the world's highest active volcanoes and is the perfect peak to start your climbing career. Previous experience is not necessary if you want to scale Cotopaxi's ice-capped summit, but you need to be very fit and accustomed to high altitude. All ascents ought to be accompanied by an experienced, qualified guide.  Discover the lofty town of Zaruma  Hidden in the highlands of El Oro is this beautifully preserved colonial town that doubles as a mountain retreat. Perched on a hilltop at the heart of a pre-Hispanic gold mining area, it has steep twisting streets, painted wooden houses, a beautiful main plaza and Ecuador's largest wooden church.  Explore the lofty capital, Quito  Scattered across a spectacular valley and surrounded by snow-capped volcanoes, Quito is one of South America's best-preserved colonial cities. Its lavishly decorated 16th-century churches are full of exquisite religious art, while its plazas remember marching conquistadores, shackled slaves and Jesuits preaching to the Indians. It's not all crumbling colonial facades, though: the hip New Town abounds with chic hotels, contemporary restaurants and cool bars.  Go surfing  The Pacific coast of Ecuador has sandy beaches and rolling surf that are a big draw for board riders. The village of Montañita has grown into something of a surfers' enclave with plenty of cheap accommodation and a lively nightlife. Mompiche in the north is also a superb place to catch a wave.  Go to the Galapagos Islands  Straddling the Equator, 1,000km (622 miles) off mainland Ecuador, the Galapagos Islands famously helped inspire Charles Darwin's theory of evolution. Considered the most biodiverse place on Earth, this volcanic archipelago is home to a unique collection of wildlife including giant tortoises, iguanas, boobies, penguins, flamingos, sea lions, whales and sharks. The creatures are largely indifferent to humans, which means visitors can get up close and personal without them scurrying off. If you can, fork out for a cruise: it's the best way to see Galapagos.  Haggle at an Indian market  Indigenous markets are an ethnologist's wonder, but also a cheap and efficient way to stock up on gifts for your friends and families. Otavalo is perhaps the most famous bazaar in Ecuador and its stalls sell anything from alpaca pashminas to wooden handicrafts. For a less touristy experience, head to the market in Saqisili, which offers an authentic slice of local life.  Kick back in Cuenca  Cuenca is a charming colonial city crammed full of heritage buildings, which have earned it a place on UNESCO's World Heritage list. Wander down Cuenca's cobblestone streets and discover an excellent archaeology museum, beautiful blue-domed cathedral, pretty plazas and countless whitewashed buildings with ironwork balconies. Nearby Ingapirca gives a glimpse of Ecuador's pre-colonial history; the country's best-developed archaeological site, which dates back to pre-Inca times but was incorporated into an Inca site.  Learn Spanish  Quito is the Spanish language learning capital of South America, with a wealth of schools and classes set up to help you master the language, which locally is spoken softly and clearly. One-on-one and group tuition is available with personalised programmes drawn up to help speaking and communication skills in a short period of time. Check reviews and talk to other students to gauge the quality of the course and the academy in advance.  Marvel at the mounds of Cochasqui  North of Quito stand the most elaborate pre-Inca mounds and monuments in the country; 15 truncated clay pyramids, nine of which have long ramps attached. Covered by earth and grass they vanished from view but several have been subsequently uncovered and excavated to show how they were built.  Ride the Devil's Nose  Trains rattling along the so-called Devil's Nose pull off the seemingly impossible task of scaling a mountain, making this one of the world's most impressive railway journeys. Zigzagging through switchbacks and skirting along track inches from a rocky precipice, trains flirt with the edge as they navigate this perilous route, which takes passengers from the jungle to the lofty Andes above. A must do if you're visiting Ecuador.  Straddle the equator  A huge granite monument marks the equator just north of Quito – the only problem is that this massive marker is in the wrong place. The nearby Inti Nan museum claims to sit on the true equator, where guides show you how water swirls clockwise and anti-clockwise on either side of the line, plus various other tricks.  Subject yourself to a good thrashing  The traditional healers of San Francisco Market in Quito offer cures for various afflictions, ranging from anxiety to nightmares. Treatments differ, but most involve being thrashed with nettles, which is thought to help patients gain control of their feelings. If the healers aren't sure what's wrong with you, they may give you an x-ray… using a dead guinea pig.  Tackle the white water at Tena  Famous for its rainforest and the rivers that flow through it, Tena is a beautiful place from which to discover the Amazon. It is, however, whitewater rafting that Tena is most famous for, with some of the best runs in the world available to tackle nearby. Sign up with a licensed agency and paddle down stunning stretches of river before riding grade 3-4+ rapids, depending on the route and river.  Take a hike in the Andes  High-altitude walks in the Cotopaxi and El Cajas national parks require some serious stamina due to the lack of oxygen, but if you can brave the altitude they offer the chance to see the stunning scenery of the grass-covered paramo plateaus, surrounded by volcanoes.  Trek through the Amazon  The tropical rainforest of the Oriente teems with wildlife; there are thought to be at least 230 species of mammal and 1,600 species of bird here, not to mention 3,500 types of orchids and 4,500 butterflies. The Oriente begins as cloud forest on the flanks of the Andes, before plunging into the steamy Amazon jungle. This wet wilderness is home to a smattering of eco-lodges, from where travellers can embark on canoe expeditions through the intricate network of rivers and creeks that form the Amazon basin. Independent travel in the jungle is unadvisable.  Veer off the tourist trail to Loja  The isolated province of Loja is a maze of small ranges, valleys and cloud forest that is home to the town of Loja, one of Ecuador's most cultured cities. Removed from the regular tourist trail, it has a distinct character. Culturally self-sufficient it is home to the proud Saraguros people who maintain many of their old traditions. Loja is also a good base for visiting Parque Nacional Podocarpus and is a stopping point on the route to Vilcabamba.  Wend your way down the ‘Avenue of Volcanoes’  Driving along the Pan Americana Highway, you'll find yourself surrounded by the snow-capped volcanoes that dominate the central highlands. Dubbed the 'Avenue of Volcanoes' by German explorer, Alexander Von Humboldt, the lofty Andean peaks are prime for hiking and climbing. Cotopaxi and Chimborazo are the most notable volcanoes; the latter has the distinction of being the closest point on Earth to the sun, thanks to something called the equatorial bulge.  Wend your way to Guayaquil  The economic heartland and commercial centre of the country, as well as the logical access point from the south, Guayaquil is a proud and prosperous place. The Malecon, the long riverside promenade that doubles as a town square, is a masterpiece of modern architecture, with shady gardens and nice restaurants. Nearby, Barrio las Peñas is a former slum converted into a bohemian district, full of galleries, souvenir shops and bars. All flights to the Galapagos originate or stop here en route from Quito.",south america,,

Spuds are definitely are on the menu however; Idaho is the number one potato producer in the USA and the humble root vegetable is synonymous with the state. So are jewels. Nearly every known gemstone has been found in Idaho, which is affectionately dubbed the Gem State.      Of course, there’s much more to Idaho than spuds and stones. Nestling on the western side of the Rocky Mountains, the state dishes up a hefty dollop of stellar scenery: evergreen forests, raging rivers, gnarly lava fields, dazzling mountains and shimmering lakes abound.

croatia,"Occupying a stunning stretch of the Adriatic coastline, Croatia is one of Europe's top seaside destinations. Boasting more than 1,100 islands, the country is renowned for its limpid waters and picture-perfect scenery.      But Croatia is much more than sea and sunshine – it’s home to historic walled cities and spectacular Roman ruins, as well as imposing castles and unspoiled national parks. The fantastic cuisine, including seafood on the coast and truffles in Istria, fine wines and buzzing café culture add to the appeal.      The capital, Zagreb, can be called quintessentially Central European. Everything from the architecture to the hearty cuisine reflects the region’s centuries-old ties with the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The city also makes a good base from which to explore the historic castles and vineyards of Zagorje.      One thing that has changed greatly in the last decade in Croatia is tourism. The coast was once an undiscovered, undeveloped natural wonder as beautiful as Italy's, but without the fanfare. Now tourists from Britain, Germany and beyond flock to the Dalmatian region, and many have snapped up holiday homes.      The gorgeous seaside cities of Split and Dubrovnik still maintain their charm, but tend to be crowded with tourists during the day. The evenings in these coastal hubs tend to be much quieter, and there are often classical music concerts and other events in the city centres.      Beyond the tourist zones, Croatia is full of isolated places where you can discover more traditional, local life. Head to Plitvice for its amazing, lake-strewn national park, or explore the rugged mountain ranges of Velebit and Gorski Kotar, havens for hiking.      Back on the Adriatic, Croatia offers ideal sailing conditions, scuba diving and sea kayaking. And of course, those in search of a more restful holiday can enjoy hours of sunshine on the beach. As Europe's top naturist destination, Croatia is also a place where you can even get that all-over tan.      Clothing is advised if you’re planning to explore the country’s seven UNESCO World Heritage Sites, world-class museums and festivals, which come thick and fast throughout the summer.","Croatia  Attractions in Croatia  Art and sculpture  See fine examples of early Croatian religious art at the Museum of Croatian Archaeological Monuments (www.mhas-split.hr) in Split.

Dubrovnik's turbulent history can be unearthed at the Rector's Palace, War Photo Limited (www.warphotoltd.com) and the Maritime Museum.  Golden Cape  The fine golden shingle of Zlatni Rat (Golden Cape) makes it Croatia's most photographed beach, located just outside the tourist resort of Bol (www.bol.hr) on the island of Brac. It's also one of Croatia's top windsurfing destinations.  Hiking and climbing  Velebit is Croatia's most extensive mountain range and the best area for hiking lies just inland from the coast between Senj and Starigrad-Paklenica, and contains two national parks, Sjeverni Velebit in the north and Paklenica in the south.

Plitvice Lakes National Park  Plitvice Lakes National Park (www.np-plitvicka-jezera.hr) is one of Croatia's premier tourist attractions - a UNESCO-listed tree-shrouded wonderland of 16 turquoise lakes and waterfalls. Though busy with visitors in the summer, Croatia’s most famous national park never fails to disappoint, with water gushing over ancient travertine beds and tumbling down high waterfalls.       Over thousands of years, the waters that flow through this area have passed over limestone and chalk, creating deposits which form natural barriers between the lakes. The lakes range in height from Proscansko Jezero at 636.6m (1746ft) above sea level, to the lowest, Kaludjerovac, at 505.2m (1386ft), and in surface area from 81 hectares (33 acres) to one hectare (2.5 acres).

Split  Travel back in time to Split (www.visitsplit.com), the capital of Central Dalmatia, which was founded in the third century AD by the Roman Emperor Diocletian. Croatia's second city is a major port, and the main jumping off point for ferries to and from some of the most popular islands, including Hvar and Brač. At its core is the truly amazing Diocletian's Palace (another UNESCO World Heritage Site), built for Diocletian and which is now a warren of houses, shops, alleys and historic architecture spanning some 1700 years.  Trogir  Just west of Split is the tiny medieval city of Trogir (www.tztrogir.hr), that was was founded by the Greeks in the third century BC.

Stroll around its narrow cobbled streets, drink coffee on a ruined Roman Forum and listen to classical recitals in the ninth-century Church of St Donat.  Zagorje  Head for the undulating hills and vineyards of Zagorje (www.tz-zagorje.hr), just north of Zagreb, to explore the historic Veliki Tabor and Trakošćan castles.  Zagreb  The Croatian capital is unquestionably its most interesting city, despite the focus of tourism on the coast. Beautiful architecture, a huge number of museums and galleries, excellent restaurants, a lively café culture and some lovely parks and gardens all make Zagreb an essential part of any visit to Croatia.      Visit the historic monuments of Gornji Grad (Upper Town): the Cathedral, St Mark's Church (noted for its tiled roof) and the Sabor (Croatian parliament). Then check out the museums of 19th-century Donji Grad (Lower Town).      The Museum of Arts and Crafts (www.muo.hr) traces Croatian craftsmanship through the centuries, and the Mimara Museum exhibits a rich collection of painting, sculpture and ceramics from abroad. Admire Mestrovic's dramatic sculptures at the Mestrovic Atelier (www.mdc.hr/mestrovic).  Šibenik  Central Dalmatia's second city, Šibenik (www.sibenik-tourism.hr), is worth visiting for its 15th-century UNESCO-listed Cathedral of St James alone. The Old Town was founded by the Slavs, not the Romans or Venetians.",europe,,
niue,"Laidback, friendly and unremittingly beautiful, tiny Niue is an idyllic retreat from the modern world.      The island nation’s rugged coastline, crystal clear waters and coral reefs offer excellent diving, snorkelling and whale watching. Birdwatchers are also well catered for: parakeets, white-tailed terns and other exotic birds and butterflies can be spotted darting among hibiscus and orchids.      Despite its remote location in the South Pacific, Niue is rarely short of visitors, with regular flights from Auckland bringing planeloads of sun-seeking Kiwis. At the same time however, there are only a handful of hotels, so it never feels crowded – sometimes it’s easy to imagine you have the island all to yourself.      Arrive between July and October, and you can not only witness the annual humpback whale migration, but even join them for a swim. And if your trip doesn’t coincide with these gentle cetaceans, spinner dolphin pods are resident year-round.      The island is literally the tip of an undersea mountain, so head offshore and the land plunges rapidly into the deep. You can hook marlin, wahoo and skipjack tuna without having to sail miles from the coast.      Directly beneath the water’s surface, snorkellers and divers can explore an underwater paradise of hidden caves and chasms rife with colourful sea creatures. And above water, Niue’s limestone caves conceal fossils, secret passageways and ancient burial places, while alluring trails lead you through tropical rainforest to secluded sandy coves. There’s even room for nine holes of golf.      If you’re feeling particularly adventurous, sign up to the Rally of the Rock, an annual bike ride that takes Lycra-clad participants through a mixture of bush tracks and paved roads.      Whatever you do in Niue, it’s usually not long before you’ve got to know half the island’s population, who make sure you have the time of your life.","Niue  Attractions in Niue  Alofi  Explore Alofi: take a look at the Women's Club Town Hall with its handicraft shop, and peruse Alofi Market on Fridays.  Avaiki Cave  Take a peek into the huge, gaping Avaiki Cave, reported to be where the first settler's canoe landed here. It is most accessible at low tide, and has a deep pool overhung by large stalagmites.  Explore by bicyle  Explore the coastline and frangipani-scented interior on two wheels. Cycling is easy and enjoyable thanks to a good network of quiet, sealed and relatively flat roads. If you're game, there is an annual race around the island's ring road in September.  Game fishing  Take advantage of Niue's sheer drops from reefs into deep ocean, which make land-based game fishing a unique experience here. Red bass, wahoo, tuna, sailfish and marlin abound. Traditional outrigger canoes and motor boats can be arranged for line-fishing expeditions.  Go caving  Niue has an extensive cave system, both under and over the sea. Some caves were even used as homes by islanders until the mid 1800s. Some can be found without help, but for the better ones take a guide.  Matapa Chasm  See Matapa Chasm with its fabulous swimming and snorkelling area, encased by steep cliffs overhanging a deep pool. Niueans sometimes jump from the overhanging cliffs into the deep water.  Niue traditions  Catch a glimpse of Niue's oldest traditions. Every month there are traditional coming-of-age haircutting and ear-piercing ceremonies held in various locations. However, prior permission must be sought to witness these.  Palaha Cave  Brave the slippery entrance to Palaha Cave, a dramatically sculpted and oddly coloured cavern that joins with many smaller caves; there is also a delightful little pool at its mouth, which locals recommend as the best spot to enjoy a romantic sunset (provided there is a low tide).  Reef walk  Go on a reef walk around Niue's raised reef at low tide.  Rich marine life  Enjoy the clear and unpolluted waters, rich marine life and beautiful underwater landscape by scuba-diving. Keep an eye out for turtles, dolphins, water snakes, whales and all manner of fish. For further information, contact Niue Dive (www.dive.nu).  Swim and snorkel  There are good swimming and snorkelling locations at Vaitafe, Avaiki and Limu, with its colourful coral, rich marine life and nice beach. Avatele Bay is another excellent location, and visitors can watch fishermen in their canoes and dinghies.  Talava Arches  Visit the Talava Arches at low tide. These are a group of extraordinary arches and caverns, many containing stalactites and stalagmites, which may be visited at low tide. The archway was noted by Captain Cook in the 18th century.  Togo Chasm  Visit Togo Chasm, on the island's eastern side, which is a beautiful area with tropical rainforest, towering coral pinnacles, white sand, palms and a hidden pond reputed to be home to a monstrous eel.  Tropical rainforest  Take a walk on the wild side: Venture into the tropical rainforest within Huvalu Forest Conservation Area, full to the brim with flora and fauna, none of it poisonous or harmful to visitors.  Whale watching  Have a close encounter with whales: Humpbacks shelter in the bays around Avatele and Tamakautoga between June to October, sometimes as close as 50m (150ft) from the water's edge. It is even possible to go swimming, snorkelling or diving with them.",oceania,,
rwanda,"Dubbed 'The Land of a Thousand Hills', Rwanda's lush green landscape, and the diverse wildlife that inhabits it, is indeed the country's star attraction. This small, landlocked nation in East Africa has been pulling in an increasing number of in-the-know international tourists over the last decade.      But back in 1994, few would have thought that the country could bounce back from the horrifying Rwanda genocide, where an estimated 800,000 Rwandans were tragically slaughtered by Hutu extremists (an ethnic group indigenous to the region). It was one of the darkest days in modern African history.      But rebound it has. Today, Rwanda is known for its progressive policies just as much as its regretful history. The country is a role model in gender equality (Rwanda's government has had the highest percentage of female members throughout the 21st century) and conservation (notably enforcing a country-wide ban on plastic bags in 2008).      Similarly, the country is a pioneer in ecotourism, with the creation of cycle lanes, wetland regions and sustainable wildlife tours, the standout of which is to see a troop of mountain gorillas in the thick forests of Volcanoes National Park on the country's northern border. In fact, Volcanoes National Park was where Dian Fossey, the world's leading authority on mountain gorillas, spent many years studying the endangered species. In 1983, she published the highly acclaimed Gorillas in the Mist, which was later made into a film.      It's not all about gorillas, though. Nyungwe National Park, in the south of the country, is one of the largest remaining rainforests in Africa and is home to 13 species of primates, including chimpanzees and colobus monkeys, while Akagera National Park, in eastern Rwanda, offers up opportunities to spot rhinos, lions and hippos. And although Rwanda is landlocked, Lake Kivu covers a large portion of its western border with the Democratic Republic of the Congo, offering sandy beaches and warm waters for visitors to soak up the coastal vibe.      It's also worth spending a few days in the capital, Kigali. Established in 1907, Kigali has grown exponentially after becoming Rwanda's capital in 1962. The city is colourful and vibrant, with lively markets and bustling restaurants abound. It is also clean and safe. To many visitors, Kigali offers cosmopolitan fun that complements Rwanda's rural attractions.      Indeed, the past of Rwanda may be bleak, but the future certainly looks bright for Rwanda.","Rwanda  Attractions in Rwanda  Akagera National Park  After the genocide, Akagera National Park was overrun by returning refugees and much of the wildlife was wiped out. But the Rwandan government, with the help of Africa Parks, has rehomed these displaced people and begun restoring Akagera to its former glory – with lions successfully reintroduced in 2015 and rhinos in 2017. Visitors here also have the chance to spot elephants, hippos, giraffes, baboons and monkeys, and some 480 species of bird.  Butare  Once the largest city in Rwanda, Butare (also known as Huye) is considered the intellectual capital of the country, as it houses several academic institutions, including the National University of Rwanda. The most prominent tourist attraction here is the superb Ethnographic Museum, which displays a vast collection of historical, artistic and archaeological items that give visitors a deep insight into the pre-colonial lifestyles, and subsequent development of Rwanda as a modern African state.  Gisenyi  Rwanda may be landlocked, but you can still hit the beach in Gisenyi: a pretty market town on the northern edge of Lake Kivu, right on the border with neighbouring the Democratic Republic of the Congo. As well as fine slithers of golden sand (better for lounging than swimming), the town lays claim to a large brewery, which proudly produces Rwanda's celebrated beer: Primus.  Kibuye  Located on the eastern shore of Lake Kivu, Kibuye is a perfect place to unwind. It's also unremittingly beautiful: steep, forested slopes rise from crystalline waters, which are dotted with canoes and fishing boats. The town itself is home to a lively market, and there is a burgeoning range of hotels and restaurants tracing the shoreline.  Kigali  Safe and clean, Rwanda's capital is abuzz with bars, restaurants and hotels, all backed by a towering skyline. Some of the highlights on offer here include the vibrant Kimironko Market, selling everything from carved wooden masks to fresh bananas, and Rwanda Art Museum, displaying striking works from local and international artists. Mt Kigali, a hill on the outskirts of town, is also a worthy diversion as it offers great views over the city from its summit.  Kigali, Genocide Memorial Centre  In 1994, approximately 800,000 Tutsis and scores of moderate Hutus – the two main groups in Rwanda – were murdered by Hutu extremists during the tragic Rwandan Genocide. The Kigali Genocide Memorial museum pays tribute to these victims (many of who are buried in a mass grave outside), and chronicles the events that led to the slaughter. It's a heart-breaking but important monument to a seminal moment in Rwanda's history.  Nyungwe National Park  Located in the mountainous region southwest of Rwanda, Nyungwe National Park covers some 1,000km² (386 sq miles) of rainforests. The park is home to a diverse array of primates, including chimpanzees, black-and-white colobus monkeys, owl-faced monkeys (with beak-like noses), blue monkeys and L'Hoest's monkeys. Many of these creatures are endangered, while L'Hoest's monkeys, recognisable by their white 'beards', are endemic to the Albertine Rift (a geographical region covering parts of Uganda, the DRC, Rwanda, Burundi and Tanzania).  Nyungwe National Park, Canopy Walkway  Hovering a hair-raising 70m (230ft) above the forest floor, this swaying walkway offers wonderful vistas over Nyungwe National Park. The 160m-long (525ft) bridge also makes for a great vantage point to spot some of the park's 322 species of bird or 120 species of butterfly.  The Rwanda Film Festival  Founded in 2005, the Rwanda Film Festival is held each year over seven days (usually during October). Most of the screenings take place in venues around Kigali, but, as part of a drive to bring culture to the farthest corners of this country, pop-up cinemas are erected in rural Rwanda, showing everything from Hollywood blockbusters to contemporary African documentaries. It's a highlight in the country's cultural calendar.  Volcanoes National Park, Dian Fossey's grave  Perhaps nobody has done more to aid the conservation – or increase our understanding – of mountain gorillas than Dian Fossey, an American zoologist who spent nearly two decades studying the primates in Rwanda. Fossey moved to Volcanoes National Park in 1967, where she spent long days in isolation studying the creatures and raising awareness about the threat of poaching, in an attempt to save the animals from extinction. She succeeded, but was murdered in the process by an unknown assailant. Her gravestone, next to the research centre she founded, has become a pilgrimage site for naturalists. Reaching it requires a 30-minute drive from the park headquarters, followed by a scenic two-hour hike through the forest. Permits and guides are required.  Volcanoes National Park, mountain gorillas  Gorilla trekking in Volcanoes National Park is Rwanda's most famous tourist attraction – and tops many a nature lover's bucket list. Tracking permits must be booked in advance (only 96 are issued daily) and cost US$1,500. Those lucky enough to obtain permits are split into small trekking groups, with assigned guides, and hike to one of a handful of designated forest clearings, where they spend a memorable hour observing one of the habituated gorilla families.",africa,,

saskatchewan,"Known affectionately as the Land of the Living Skies, Saskatchewan offers abundant wildlife, crowd-free national parks and some of the most impressive heavens you’re likely to encounter – the shape-shifting Northern Lights are one of its biggest lures.      Although vast swathes of farmland and prairie cover a significant proportion of this province, head north and these give way to rippling hills, boreal forest and an aquatic bonanza of around 100,000 lakes and rivers.      Saskatchewan isn’t a place for rushing around. It’s a place for lying outstretched in a field and gazing at a flock of geese piercing the endless blue sky or escaping city crowds and hunkering down for a peaceful retreat on a sprawling farm.      If you’re itching to get active though, there’s plenty of space to move. Saddle up and ride towards the sunset in the Cypress Hills or experience life as a cowboy on a cattle drive. Swim, boat or hook giant trout on the humongous Lake Diefenbaker. Hike, canoe or kayak through the thick boreal forest of Prince Albert National Park, where you can spy moose, elk and bears.      And if you do need an urban hit, Saskatoon reels you in with its attractive river trails, cosmopolitan eateries and eclectic festival line-up. And then there’s Regina, where you can catch sight of Mounties-in-training at the country’s only Royal Canadian Mounted Police training academy and learn about the force’s history at the slick Arthur Erickson-designed RCMP Heritage Centre.      Before you go, kit yourself out in green and white and join the rambunctious Saskatchewan Roughriders fans in roaring on the side at a high-energy Canadian Football game.","Saskatchewan  Attractions in Saskatchewan  Birdwatching  The south of the province is particularly good for birdwatching.

The 2013 Ibrahim Index of African Governance proclaimed this small West African nation to be the most improved country on the continent – and many are hoping Liberia will continue in this vein.      Assuming it does, adventurous travellers will likely be tempted back to this small, coastal nation; a country characterised by its windswept golden beaches, luscious rainforests and verdant savannahs, where twittering birds, screeching monkeys and stomping elephants provide a wild soundtrack.      But there’s more to this country than natural wonders. Founded by freed American and Caribbean slaves, Africa’s oldest republic is home to a staggering diversity of cultures; its four million odd inhabitants are comprised of more than 16 established peoples, and there’s a burgeoning Asian and Middle Eastern population, too.      Art has long played an important role in Liberian culture, and the country’s various ethnic groups are renowned for their ornate wooden sculptures, particularly wooden masks, which are said to connect the living with ancestral spirits and ancient deities. Like art, religion is also woven into the fabric of Liberian life; casual ceremonies with sacred catfish hold force even while churches and mosques are full.      Liberia’s tropical climate, with a long dry season from September to June and rains peaking in August, still decide everything from transport to working schedules. During the monsoon roads become rivers and, at times, the country feels very much at the mercy of nature.      Yet Liberia is very much the master of its own destiny and its emergence as a credible tourist destination will depend largely on whether peace prevails and whether there is significant investment in the country’s creaking infrastructure.","Liberia  Attractions in Liberia  Bask on Monrovia's Beaches  The most famous beaches are the surfing ones near Robertsport. However there are a series of beaches surrounding Monrovia. Most have dangerous currents, but ELWA, Silver, and Cece Beach are all open to swimmers. Both Silver and Cece have bars and restaurants, with Cece stretching miles beyond the crowds for those in need of solitude.  Climb Mountain Woligizi  Mount Wologizi in northern Liberia is the country's highest point. Flanked by dense jungle, the mountain is accessible by road at the village of Lisco. The mountain trail leads past waterfalls and a series of sloping hills to the summit, from which three countries can be seen (Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea), not to mention the largely unmapped tropical forests that cover swathes of the region.  Cross a monkey bridge  Fast running rivers cascade through the Lofa rainforest to the mangroves surrounding Monrovia. Crossing these torrents are monkey bridges, which are made from rainforest materials (vines and the like) and are rewoven by locals every year. The reweaving of these monkey bridges is part of a ceremony organised by local secret societies, which are responsible for organising most social activity in Lofa.  Experience the bustle of Monrovia  The capital of Liberia, this is where most urban attractions sit mixed together: ruined buildings from a dozen different eras mix with sushi bars, a national museum, Waterside cloth market, the Freemasons Temple and packed new supermarkets. The population is equally diverse with UN and NGO expatiates from around the world exchanging detailed stories of life in Liberia and world politics with people from every part of Liberia.  Explore Sapo National Park  Corruption and war has seen many of Liberia's forests destroyed for timber, but Sapo lives on. This is largely down to the Sapo people, who gave up their land to create this national park and now dedicate their time protecting it. The journey there takes over 11 hours from Monrovia, but it's worth it: according to Conservation International it has the highest concentration of mammals on Earth.  Go deep-sea fishing  Just 12km (7.5 miles) off the shore of Monrovia, a deep sea trench hides a wealth of fish giants, including scores of blue marlin, sailfish, and yellow fin tuna. The best season is November through May when boats, complete with experienced captains, can be charted. Despite the wealth of fish, there are relatively few boats to compete with.  Monkey around in Marshall  This verdant coastal resort often comes as a surprise to tourists. Not only because it contains a luxury resort, which offers something of a contrast to accommodation standards in the rest of the country, but because it is also home to an island populated exclusively by rescued chimpanzees. There's also a swimmable lagoon and gorgeous golden beaches.  Search for pygmy hippos  In the extreme north of Liberia lies the East Nimba Nature Reserve, a verdant jungle that harbours birds, butterflies, monkeys and the elusive pygmy hippo. Trails crisscross the reserve and well-informed guides and guesthouses are available for visitors. Nimba is easier to reach than Sapo with a tar road for most of the route from Monrovia to Gabrnga.  Step back in time at Harper  Located in southern Liberia, Harper was once the home of President Tubman, who lavished attention on his town with vanity construction projects. However, the gorgeous art deco houses, once the jewel in Harper's crown, have long since been abandoned and reoccupied by those in need of shelter. As well as providing an extraordinary contrast between then and now, wealth and poverty, Harper offers stunning beaches and bountiful marine life including whales and dolphins.  Surf at Robertsport  The most famous beaches are the surfing ones near Robertsport in Grand Cape Mount County. Some surfers prefer to ride the waves during the quieter weekdays, while others like showboating to the crowds at the weekend, but all are united in their appreciation for the reliable breaks that roll in most days. Local surfers offer lessons for the less experienced.",africa,,
australian capital territory,"It might be a mere crumb of land on the map, but the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) – as its grand name suggests – gives home to Canberra, the nation's pristine capital. Rarely seen as a standalone travel destination, the city itself retains its own distinct atmosphere, having evolved from a quiet bush-land home for bureaucrats and politicians to a modern and vibrant hub, offering stunning cuisine, strong arts venues and an active student population.      As befitting its status, the city is filled with cultural experiences, including world-renowned museums and galleries. Highlights for Canberra visitors include the National Gallery, the Australian War Memorial and Questacon, the national science and technology centre. You’ll also find some great places to try the cool-climate wines that the ACT is becoming known for.      Canberra accounts for a healthy swathe of the ACT, but the territory also finds space to accommodate the natural beauty of the Namadgi National Park. In the summer, the park offers a spectacular array of bushwalks that meander through its lush flora and fauna. In the winter the Bimberi and Brindabella Ranges receive a dusting of picturesque snow.      Incongruously, perhaps, other local attractions include the large satellite dishes at the Canberra Deep Space Communication Complex, which is set in foothills southwest of the city. They’re still used to provide two-way support for spacecraft in orbit and are one of only three such systems in the world.      The ACT is surrounded on all sides by New South Wales and draws little in the way of tourist attention, but for those who decide to pay a visit, it can offer far more than its rather staid image might suggest. Small it might be, but it’s more than just a geographical curio.","Australian Capital Territory  Attractions in Australian Capital Territory  Bushwalks  A great Australian pastime, no trip would be complete without exploring Canberra’s many bushwalks. Take to Namadgi National Park for over 160 km (99 miles) of walking tracks, scale Gibraltar Peak in Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve or tackle a walk closer to the city with Red Hill Lookout, Black Mountain or Mount Painter. Most trails allow visitors to embark on a good exploration of the Australian bush, with panoramic views across the reserve and even include the chance to see some Aboriginal rock art.  Bywong Town  The boom time for this town, 80km (50 miles) from Canberra, was between 1895-1906. Today Bywong is a living history lesson with a recreated 1890s village on the site. See the mine site and the machinery used to extract gold from the ore as part of a gold tour.  Canberra, Australian National Botanic Gardens  Bursting with Australia's beautiful and diverse plant life, Canberra's Australian National Botanic Gardens are a refreshing green escape. Wander or take a tour within its diverse gardens, spot butterflies fluttering amongst vibrant flowers or keep an eye out for resident Chocolate Wattled Bats. There is also a healthy café onsite offering wholesome and local meals.  Canberra, Australian War Memorial  Spend the annual ANZAC Day at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, which is deservedly one of the city's most popular attractions, and the scene of the colourful annual ANZAC Parade. It contains archives, galleries displaying relics, photographs and art.  Canberra, Black Mountain Tower   Peer down at the Australian Capital Territory from the 195m (650ft) Black Mountain Tower on the summit of the 812m- (2,664ft-) high Black Mountain.  Canberra, National Gallery   The National Gallery, located in Canberra features almost 160,000 works of art from all around the world, spanning collections by European masters such as Van Gogh to indigenous art. Featuring an impressive outdoor space, visitors will be mesmerised by James Turrell’s ‘Skyspace’, an immersive and remarkable sculptural monument.  Canberra, National Museum of Australia  Delve into the depths of Australian history on the shores of Canberra’s Lake Burley Griffin, at the National Museum of Australia, the storybook of the nation. From aboriginal bark paintings to documentation of the Sydney Olympics, all facets of Australia's diverse past are found here.  Canberra, Parliament House  Observe where parliament used to sit until 1988 at the impressive Old Parliament House in Canberra's elegant city of wide streets, gardens and parkland; learn more about the role and function of the federal parliament at the more modern Parliament House.  Cycling   Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve and Namadgi National Park are great to explore and discover by bike. The sanctuary at Tidbinbilla offers a chance to witness the wildlife of the area up close, while mountain biking across the fire trails in Namadgi National Park remains a popular pastime, with 400km (250 miles) of track to cover.  Golfing  Make time for a round of golf: the Royal Canberra Golf Club, located on the shores of Lake Burley Griffin, is ranked amongst the top 10 courses in Australia while the Federal Golf Club features views to the Brindabella mountain ranges.  Hot air balloon ride  Take to the skies in a balloon for the perfect vista of Canberra, or for the less adventurous, glance up at a flurry of them at the Festival Balloon Spectacular every year around March and April. The best views are offered from the lawns of Old Parliament House.  Murrumbidgee River Corridor  Round off a good walk or horse ride with a picnic in the scenic park area along the Murrumbidgee River Corridor. More than 60km (37 miles) of the Murrumbidgee River meanders through the territory, and there are myriad picnic and swimming spots.  Namadgi National Park  Gaze at prehistoric sites with Aboriginal rock paintings, rare sub-alpine species of flora and fauna and enjoy spectacular views and walking tracks in the Namadgi National Park. Keep an eye on the skies at one of the most important bird habitats in the region, which becomes a refuge for large numbers of waterbirds during drought in inland Australia: the wetlands.  Snowy Mountains  Just a two-hour drive south of Canberra, the Snowy Mountains are worth at least a day trip out. Travel through historic Cooma and Thredbo village and take a chairlift up to the peaks. Enjoy the Alpine scenery on skis or snowboard in winter and try horse riding, quad biking or a variety of watersports in summer. For spectacular mountain views, try your hand at the Kosciuszko Alpine Way, that meanders through quint villages and majestic sceneries, from Canberra to Victoria.  Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve  Enjoy a wealth of Australian fauna and flora at the Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve; a number of bushwalking trails are provided, and visitors can observe majestic mountain views and lush forests of gums and ferns. Follow the Birrigai Trail and experience the native homeland of the Ngunawal people, whilst spotting kangaroos, emus, wallabies, platypus, bush birds and water birds in their natural habitat.",oceania,australia,
gambia,"The Gambia may be mainland Africa's smallest nation, but it punches way above its weight in terms of attractions. With its glorious long sandy beaches, bustling architecturally-stunning towns and wealth of wildlife, it's perhaps the most striking of all West African countries. What's more, its people are kind and welcoming, giving The Gambia the reputation of being the 'The Smiling Coast'.      Virtually enveloped by its much larger neighbour Senegal, The Gambia's narrow landmass still retains its own clear identity, despite the colonial carve up of Africa. Although this accessible Anglophone country's more obvious draw is perhaps the joy of winter sun at good-value rates, its rich history and fascinating mix of cultures make it hard to pigeonhole. If you escape the sun loungers, you will uncover another side of the country, rich in eco-tourism opportunities, wilderness, wildlife and bird watching.      Inextricably linked to the Gambia River, one of Africa's great waterways, The Gambia comprises a varied landscape, featuring lush tropical forests, swamps, marshes and large areas of wooded savannah. Alongside this are Gambia's parks, reserves and riverbanks including Kiang West National Park and River Gambia National Park, where you’ll see all kinds of wildlife, including monkeys, crocodiles, a small population of hippos and well over 500 bird species.      Of course, one of the main attractions is the coast. There are only 80 kilometres of shoreline, but the beaches are some of the most stunning in the region. Relatively uncrowded and shaded by multitudes of swaying palm trees, you'll be forgiven for thinking you've stumbled on paradise. Tanji and Bakau are both working beaches, featuring arrays of colourful pirogues and little fishing boats, perfect for experiencing traditional activities. For awe-inspiring sunsets, pick a spot on Batokunku Beach and stretch out on the unspoilt sand.      Visitors keen to experience West African music and rural culture may head off the beaten track and up-country to simple, traditional villages. All year round you'll find vibrant festivals, events full of traditional drumming, energetic dancing as well as customary wrestling matches. But for many, it is The Gambia's idyllic cocktail of sunny days, warm welcomes and relaxing Atlantic beach resorts that lures them time and again to this little slice of African heaven.","Gambia  Attractions in Gambia  Abuko Nature Reserve: Explore tropical forests  Walk through the tropical forests of the Abuko Nature Reserve, where crocodiles, monkeys, forest antelope and reptiles thrive. There are around 50 types of tropical trees in this area and 290 bird species. Among these birds are the Willow Warbler, Pied Kingfisher and Violet Turacoes. Get a good look at them while trekking the nature trail, a couple hours’ walk through the jungles and savanna.  African music: Dance the night away  The Senegambia Strip in Kokoli is the place to be as the sun sets. Having grown from a row of shacks, it now boasts a variety of fantastic bars, restaurants and live music venues. A number of resorts host dance troupes and live bands for guest entertainments. For real kicks, head to a live session from one of Gambia's many excellent local bands, or a concert featuring stars from neighbouring Senegal, home of Youssou N'Dour, Baaba Maal and many other West African greats.  Banjul: The capital of The Gambia  In the capital, visit the National Museum, which has some interesting ethnographic displays, then admire the colonial architecture in the area near July 22 Square and climb to the top of Arch 22 for great views over the city. Shop in Albert Market, the city’s lively open-air bazaar, for an illuminating glimpse of daily life. Peruse its many stalls for a selection of colourful printed fabrics, carved wooden masks and local produce.  Bask on the beach  Gunjur and Kartong are southern Gambia's most pristine beaches and home to a number of excellent eco-retreats. Alternatively visit Kotu, the best beach along Gambia's main resort strip. Be wary, though: the seas can get a little rough.  Borreh: Watch a wrestling match  Gambia’s national sport, borreh (wrestling) was in danger of slipping into the history books until it was revived under President Jammeh. The sport now features in most national events and festivals. Similar to Greco-Roman wrestling, contests, played out against a theatrical backdrop, are ferocious and frequently bloody.  Gambian rhythm: Do a little dance  Fancy moving your feet to the local beat? Then book a few lessons with a dance teacher, a master of the kora (Gambia's national instrument) or with a drumming instructor who will be able to help you buy a djembé (drum) from a local craftsman.  Katchikali Crocodile Pool: Mind your fingers  Meet a friendly croc at this ancient site, sacred to the Mandinka tribe, in the coastal village of Bakau. The crocodiles, though wild, are well fed and docile. Fertility rites are sometimes held here.  Kiang West National Park: Marvel at the mangrove creeks  Trek through this stunning national park, the most diverse ecosystem in Gambia, to see more flora and fauna than anywhere else in the country. Straddling the impressive Gambia River, this region boasts extensive mangrove creeks where West African Manatee and Nile and Dwarf Crocodiles reside. Bird lovers will be thoroughly at home, with around 250 bird species flocking the trees. Monkeys are the star attraction, but you might also catch sight of leopards, warthogs, hyena species and much more.  Makasutu Culture Forest: Take a cultural tour   Join a cultural tour of this beautiful forest park, learning about local medicinal plants and woodland fauna, then take a boat trip by dugout canoe and enjoy a spirited display of local-style music and dance in this award-winning eco-attraction. During your walk, look out for massive termite mounds, which can reach a staggering two metres.  Microlights: Get a bird’s-eye view of the country  Soar over the fields, villages, creeks and beaches of Gambia by going up in a microlight. Short airborne tours and longer trips can be arranged from the microlight base at the airport. There are various landing spots up and down the country, so you may be able to stop at a few key tourist sites.  National Museum of Albreda: Learn about the slave trade  Upriver from Banjul, explore Gambian colonial history by visiting the exhibition of the slave trade at Albreda and Jufureh – twin villages that were made famous by Alex Haley's novel Roots. The museum features exhibitions detailing human captives and a replica slave ship – then cross to Kunta Kinteh Island (formerly called James Island), mid-river, to see its ruined fort.  River Gambia National Park: Mess about on the river  Take a long-distance boat trip on the River Gambia, the dominant feature of the country. The River Gambia National Park is the most beautiful stretch of riverine vegetation where you can spot monkeys leaping through the foliage, pelicans feasting on fish and hippos relaxing in this peaceful waterway. As you drift up the river, lush rainforests will turn into Savannah and mangrove swamps emerge. A key spot to visit, is the Chimpanzee Rehabilitation Camp (CRC), which looks after and fosters orphaned chimps.  Tanbi Wetlands: Go birdwatching  Birdwatching is the most popular pastime for visitors to Gambia. Take a boat into the mangrove creeks of the Tanbi Wetlands around the mouth of the River Gambia and drift along under canopies of forested wilderness, spotting lagoons, mudflats and tidal creeks. Often visitors will see locals collecting oysters from small boats. Head south to the Tanji Reserve or travel up-country to the world-renowned Bao Bolong Wetland Reserve to spot some of the country's many resident and migrant species.  Wassu stone circles: Solve a mystery  In Eastern Gambia, catch sight of the fascinating circles of standing stones around Wassu, the most ancient human-made structures in the country and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The origin of these megalithic circles, which stand between 1m (3.2ft) and 2.5m (8.2ft) tall, is shrouded in mystery but they are thought to mark the prehistoric burial grounds of a society long-since vanished.",africa,,
newfoundland and labrador,"“Newfies” bear the brunt of many a Canadian joke, but they’re having the last laugh: raw natural beauty, charming little villages and welcoming locals should push Newfoundland and Labrador towards the front of your to-visit list.      Pretty wooden houses painted the colours of the rainbow cling to cliffsides and 10,000-year-old icebergs the size of castles drift past their front doors. Humpback, minke and blue whales (to name a few) dance offshore and half a million puffins nest in the rocks – count them if you don’t believe us.      Newfoundland and Labrador is almost three times the size of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island combined, and is blessed with 29,000km (18,125 miles) of craggy coastline. The province is filled with historic towns and landmarks documenting the region's indiginous aboriginal inhabitants, Viking visitors and maritime heritage.      Water Street on St John’s claims to be the oldest street in North America. And it is strange to think that you are actually closer here to Ireland's Cape Clear than to Ontario's Thunder Bay (though not so odd when you hear the local dialect – grab a copy of the Dictionary of Newfoundland English if you get stuck).      Newfoundland and Labrador is also a place of ancient landscapes, such as the unique and beautiful geological features of the UNESCO-listed Gros Morne National Park, or the colossal mountain ranges of the Torngat, Kaumajet and Kiglapait and their primeval exposed rock.      Many of the province’s indigenous people (the First Nations, Métis and Innu) still reside here, often in isolated communities. And the European descendants are fiercely proud of their roots, so if an Atlantic storm hits, dive into the nearest pub and enjoy an all-day knees-up, with fiddlers and accordion players cranking out Celtic-inspired tunes.","Newfoundland And Labrador  Attractions in Newfoundland And Labrador  Experience untamed Labrador  To this day, Labrador is still a largely undisturbed wilderness. The Labrador Straits Museum has displays on the Maritime Archaic Indians who built a burial mound nearby at L'Anse Amour around 5500BC. A coastal highway extends along the eastern coastline, linking most Atlantic fishing villages.  Explore Newfoundland's historic sites  There are historic settlements aplenty on the Avalon Peninsula. Trinity records European explorers' first encounter with the ancient Beothuk people. Placentia was Newfoundland's French capital in the 17th and 18th centuries. On the west coast of Newfoundland, explore native archaeological history at Port au Choix National Historic Site.  Get to know the local marine life  Newfoundland is rich in marine life and seabird colonies, attracting millions of puffins, gannets, kittiwakes, murres and petrels. Go seabird and whale watching (for humpback, fin and minke whales) by boat or kayak in the Witless Bay Ecological Reserve.  Hear the sweetest folk music  The sweet, plaintive tones of Newfoundland's famous folk music are the province's unofficial soundtrack; you can hear local bands in one of the many bars in St John's. The annual Newfoundland and Labrador Folk Festival takes place in Bannerman Park during the first full weekend in August.  Hook a fat one  Salmon fishing is good in the Exploits and Gander rivers and you can see a salmon ladder at the Rocky River Falls. The season usually runs from June to September. A qualified, licensed guide is often required by law; check in advance.  Learn about the lighthouse life  The Point Amour lighthouse is the tallest lighthouse in Atlantic Canada. Built from 1854 to 1857, it is still a working lighthouse, although now automated. The living quarters house exhibits portraying the maritime history of the Labrador Straits.  Meet the native communities  Boyd's Cove on the Kittiwake Coast recounts the history of the mysterious Beothuk people. Labrador has two main Innu communities, at Sheshatshiu and Natuashish. The Métis Aboriginal community in Labrador lives mainly around Lake Melville.  Pick up a bargain in the vibrant city of St John's  Bustling Water Street in St John's is one of North America's oldest shopping streets. Other sites include the Cathedral of St John the Baptist; Signal Hill, reception point for Marconi's first transatlantic radio transmission in 1901, which offers good views; and The Rooms, the landmark provincial museum.  Ramble on Gros Morne National Park  You can go hiking, trekking and climbing on over 100km (65 miles) of hiking trails at Gros Morne National Park. The T'Railway Park also comprises almost 900km (565 miles) of hiking trails between Port aux Basques and St John's.  Spend some time on the water  Eastern Newfoundland, a region of sheltered coves and sandy beaches, boasts some popular sailing and swimming destinations.  Take in the stunning coastal landscapes  The scenic rugged coastline of Terra Nova National Park adjoins Bonavista Bay. The Burin Peninsula has beautiful coastal villages. Icebergs float off Cape Freels, and a coastal road runs along the Long Range Mountains affording good fjord, mountain and beach views.  Take up the trail of the caribou  Enormous herds of caribou roam along the Trans-Labrador Highway. You can also find caribou and black bears in the Avalon Wilderness Reserve.  Try cross-country skiing  Newfoundland isn't a major downhill skiing destination. However, you can try skiing at Newfoundland's Marble Mountain, 10km (6 miles) east of Corner Brook, the province's second city, where the Corner Brook Winter Carnival is held each February. Other ski resorts include White Hills. Labrador has excellent cross-country skiing trails.  Walk the Great Northern Peninsula  The wild, scenic Great Northern Peninsula is renowned for Gros Morne National Park, a blend of rugged mountains, deep fjords and bays. At the peninsula's northernmost tip, UNESCO World Heritage Site L'Anse aux Meadows is the New World's earliest European settlement and features restored Viking sod houses.  Witness the Northern Lights  Lucky visitors will catch a glimpse of the Northern Lights (Aurora Borealis), which sometimes charge up the skies here, particularly in Labrador. This luminous meteoric phenomenon produces spectacular astral light shows.",north america,canada,
san marino,"The origins of San Marino are based on the charming legend of Saint Marinus, who founded the community and the republic in AD301 after taking refuge on Mount Titano. The independence of San Marino was enshrined after Italian Unification, possibly in gratitude for at one time harbouring Garibaldi, the great leader of the Risorgimento. Apart from the Vatican City, it is the only city-state that is completely surrounded by another country.      In whatever part of this 61 sq km (24 sq mile) territory you go, there seems to be a dazzling panorama at your disposal. But it is standing atop the spectacular Cesta Tower that will give you the best views. From the gorgeous Old Town clinging to the slopes, your gaze reaches across the fertile soils of Emilia Romagna, the soft rolling hills of the Marche, and on to the placid Adriatic sea. The Sammarinese territory is made up of nine ancient citadels, including the capital, San Marino.      What the tiny city state lacks in size, it makes up for in history, museums and priceless architectural monuments. Meanwhile, a wealth of assorted crafts and souvenirs provide a vast, pleasant shopping experience.      The free movement between San Marino and Italy, not to mention the fact that most locals support the Italian national team in football tournaments, might lead you to believe the territory’s independence lies in name only. But the Sammarinese have their own government and a distinct local culture. Everyone speaks Italian, but the San Marino dialect has failed to die out, while unique dishes such as white rabbit stew, black risotto and Cacciatello cake are local treasures.      As well as imbibing the local food, other pleasant diversions include getting a colourful stamp in your passport at the State Post Office, visiting the impressive Three Towers of San Marino and the lavish Parliament Building.","San Marino  Attractions in San Marino  Admire the beauty of Basilica di San Marino  San Marino boasts many fine churches, not least the Basilica di San Marino. Its roots lie in a much older medieval church, but this one was built on the same site in the 19th century in neo-classical style, complete with impressive Corinthina columns. The church holds relics of Saint Marino himself, who is credited with founding the Republic of San Marino in the 4th century.  Delve into the past at the Museum of Emigration  Experience the trials of San Marino's many emigrants at the Museum of Emigration, an informative stroll through the history of moving populations through pictures, writing and various historical records. Hosted by the Santa Chiara Monastery, the museum's setting is also of great interest.  Enjoy art old and new at St Francis' Museum  Housed within a medieval cloister, St Francis' Museum has no shortage of religious paintings on display, while there's also a bit of secular art on display at the Contemporary and Modern Art Gallery. The latter is a modest but diverting collection of painting, photography and sculpture.  Enjoy the great outdoors  Visit the scented pine forests, fields and waterways of the territory – perfect for riding, fishing and walking. For more adrenaline-fuelled fun, the precipitous slopes surrounding the capital offer testing mountain bike trails. And the azure waters of the Adriatic coast are never far away.  Explore San Marino's ancient roots at the National Museum  Based in the historic Palazzo Pergami Belluzi, the Museo di Stato features archaeological finds from the Neolithic Age, artefacts from the Etruscans, Romans and Byzantines, as well as Renaissance paintings and relics of San Marino's own unique coinage. Interestingly, the museum has benefited from thousands of private donations from fans of the republic – including Italian politicians and intellectuals.  Explore the villages  Beyond the tourist-packed capital of San Marino, there are eight picturesque villages scattered around the countryside that are also worth visiting. You'll find old battlements and religious sites including the church and convent at Valdragone, the fort at Pennarossa, Malatests Castle at Serravalle, and the stamp and coin museum at Borgo Maggiore.  Storm the fortresses of San Marino  The tiny independent state of San Marino has no less than three fortresses, including 11th-century Guaita, the 14th-century Montale and Cesta – a 13th-century edifice emerging from the ancient rock at the very highest point of Mount Titano. Each tower occupies one of San Marino's three peaks.  Wander the medieval centre  Explore the perfectly preserved medieval centre with its narrow, winding streets, churches and ancient houses. Cars are banned in this area, making a stroll around the city's ramparts a peaceful and atmospheric way of absorbing the spirit of the ancient city-state.  Watch the changing of the guard at Palazzo Pubblico  The stocky, neo-gothic Palazzo Pubblico (Government Palace) is worth a look, with its ramparts, clock tower and archways, and don't miss the changing of the guard at 0830 or 1830. For some background, head to the national museum, with its collection of archaeological finds and works of art.  Watch the sailing regatta  One of the most important dates in the calendar here is that of the 24 Ore di San Marino, the country's main sailing regatta, which is held in July and is a grand showcase of speedy vessels. There's also the Gran Premio Formula 3000, one of several annual motor racing events.",europe,,
macau,"Slipping more and more comfortably into its reputation as the “Vegas of the East,” Macau plays host to a dizzying array of large-scale casino resorts. Famously the world’s biggest gambling hub, it is one of two Special Administrative Regions of the People’s Republic of China – the other being neighbouring Hong Kong.      Macau showcases many of the same brands as its Nevada counterpart: MGM, Wynn and Sands are all in town, while its flagship Venetian Resort – complete with canals and mock Italianate plazas – is currently the largest casino on the planet.      But there’s more to the destination than poker tables and betting halls. When Macau's historic centre was added to the UNESCO World Cultural Heritage list in 2005, it underlined the strategic and cultural importance which the territory has had over the centuries.      Portuguese colonists arrived in the mid-16th century and developed Macau into a major regional trading post. They held onto it long after it had been eclipsed by Hong Kong as a magnet for merchants; longer than they held onto Goa or Brazil.      Overlooking the South China Sea, Macau consists of a peninsula and two small islands, Taipa and Coloane. The three areas have been artificially joined by land reclamation, much of which is covered in casinos. Mercifully, it is possible to escape the neon lights and gambling dens in Macau’s urban parks and historic centre, where colonial Portuguese architecture sits among the bustle of a modern Asian city.      The street stalls and restaurants of the old town are also a fine introduction to local food, which encompasses traditional Chinese and Portuguese dishes alongside Goan, Brazilian and African influences.","Macau  Attractions in Macau  A-Ma Temple  Dedicated to the Chinese goddess of the sea known as Mazu, this temple is the oldest place of worship in Macau. Founded before the arrival of the Portuguese, it inadvertently gave its name to the colony – Macau is a corruption of A-Ma Kok (the Bay of A-Ma) – but the current complex dates from the 17th century.  Camões Garden  The pleasant Jardim Luís de Camões (Camões Garden) is named after Portugal's favourite poet, active in the 16th century and said to have visited Macau (although this has been disputed). It is, nevertheless, a popular place to exercise or relax.  Colôane Island (Freguesia de São Francisco Xavier)  The larger of Macau's two connected islands, Colôane is perfect for a day trip. Nature trails thread among the hills in Seac Pai Van Park, which also has a walk-in aviary and spectacular views from the A-Ma Statue at the highest point on the island. The best of the beaches is the black-sand Hác Sá, while Colôane village is an atmospheric place with cobbled streets.  Cotai Strip  The epicentre for casino development in Macau, the Cotai Strip is reclaimed land which has joined together the islands of Colôane and Taipa (hence the name Cotai). It’s where you will find many of the biggest and most opulent casinos – including the Venetian, the Wynn and the Sands. These mega-complexes have helped Macau to race ahead of Las Vegas when it comes to gambling income.  Festivals  Macau's colourful festivals include the Dragon Boat Festival in June; the International Fireworks Display Contest, which sees 90 countries competing for honours in September/October; and the Macau International Music Festival, which presents works in Chinese and Western styles throughout October.  Gate of Understanding  The massive Gate of Understanding (designed by Charters Almeida), stands at 40m (130ft) high over the Praia Grande Bay. This is a symbolic structure representing the goodwill between China and Portugal.  Guia Hill Fortress  Built at the highest point in Macau, the Guia Hill Fortress dates back to the 17th century and can be reached by cable car or along a walking path which encircles the hill offering views over the city and its bays. Nearby is a fascinating series of wartime bunkers cut into the hill and a small museum telling the stories of those who served here; also note the faded frescoes inside the chapel building, which were uncovered during renovations. The Guia Lighthouse, standing since 1865, is still functional. As well as guiding ships through Macanese waters, its high vantage point is also used to warn the city of impending typhoons.  Historic Centre of Macau  Given UNESCO World Heritage status in 2005, the old city has eight squares and 22 historic buildings. The narrow lanes, markets and sloping cobbles combine the architectural drama of backstreet Porto and the bustling energy, cooking smells and Cantonese dialect of southern China. The focal point is the Largo do Senado, or Senate Square, which holds the Santa Casa de Misericórdia (a Portuguese charitable institution) as well as the Macau General Post Office. Numerous other attractions are found within the old city, including the ruined façade of St Paul’s church.  Kun Iam Temple  Explore the complex of temples known as Kun Iam Tong, the biggest and wealthiest of Macau's temples. It dates from the time of the Ming Dynasty, about 400 years ago, and contains, amongst other works of art, a small statue of Marco Polo. In the garden you can see the granite temple where, in 1844, the first trade treaty between the United States and China was signed.  Lou Lim Ieoc Garden  A good place to get away from the busy streets of Macau, this Chinese-style garden includes lotus ponds and bamboo groves. It was once a private garden but fell into ruin before it was bought by the government in 1974, and restored for use as a public park. Today it’s a popular spot to practice tai chi. Local legend says the nine windy turns in park’s bridge are supposed to confuse evil spirits trying to cross.  Macau Museum  The Macau Museum covers the life of Macau and its people from the first settlement to the present day. Set over three floors, it contains a vast collection of historic and social memorabilia (www.macaumuseum.gov.mo). The location, in the Fortaleza do Monte (Mount Fortress), means that the museum also boasts great views.  Macau Tower  Enjoy panoramic views - or bungee jump - from the Macau Tower (www.macautower.com.mo), an entertainment and convention centre situated on the waterfront on the Nam Van Lakes. The 338m (1,109ft) tower is one of the tallest freestanding towers in the world, and on a clear day you can see for 55km (34 miles) from the observation deck. Intrepid souls can take a walk around the outer rim while safely clipped to an overhead rail.  Racing  The Macau Jockey Club organises flat horse races on the island of Taipa (www.mjc.mo). The Far East's gala motorcycle and Formula III car racing event, the Macau Grand Prix, is held in November (www.macau.grandprix.gov.mo).  Ruins of St Paul's  Part of the UNESCO-listed Historic Centre of Macau, the ruins of the Church of St Paul's (São Paulo), which was built in 1602, are probably the most famous sight in the region. Although on the approach it looks like the building is intact, actually only the façade survived a fire in 1835. It is, nevertheless, an almost-compulsory photo stop on any visit to Macau.  St Dominic's Church  St Dominic’s Church (Igreja de São Domingos), built in the 17th century and renovated in 1997, is one of the most beautiful religious buildings in Macau. A Museum of Sacred Art, on three floors of the renovated belfry, is home to 300 works including sacred Brazilian artwork which together illustrate the history of the Catholic Church in Asia.  Taipa  The smaller of Macau’s two islands, Taipa is the location of Macau’s international airport. The main point of interest is Taipa Village, a busy place with Chinese shophouses, colonial Portuguese offices and plenty of places to eat (particularly on the Rua da Cunha). Many traditional crafts are still followed in the narrow streets and alleys, and there’s a craft fair on Sundays.",asia,china,
british virgin islands,"Sloping hills of green, lush mountainous terrain, extensive coral reefs and famous shipwrecks sum up the thrills and spills of the British Virgin Islands. With myriad nautical pursuits on offer, the 50 idyllic islands are a slice of paradise.  Norman Island was supposedly the location that Robert Louis Stevenson based Treasure Island on. Today's visitors might not stumble across swashbuckling pirates or half-concealed treasure troves, but they will find a highly prized booty of soft sand and gentle, teal waters. For travellers who prefer to watch the sea rather than get into it, there is the breathtaking chance of spotting dolphins and whales criss-crossing the surface.  Throughout much of their history, the string of islands and cays were sleepy and unnoticed. Today, colossal cruise ships glide to a halt in the shadow of Road Town on Tortola, the largest of the islands. Smaller ships also take in Virgin Gorda, the second biggest island, docking outside the curiously named Spanish Town. Hardly qualifying as a town, the latter has a few shops and a pretty marina, and is quiet, picturesque settlement. Road Town offers a little more action, with a gleaming harbour and waterfront, as well plenty of pastel-coloured West Indian architecture. Sir Olva Georges Square is a pleasant spot to take a seat and admire the views.  Although the tourism industry is booming here, you can easily get away from it all. Much of the accommodation beyond Road Town offers utter tranquility, while some of the hotels elsewhere in the territory pretty much have islands to themselves.  Paradise does come at a cost. Overall, the British Virgin Islands are quite an expensive destination. But, for some, this is the necessary price of saving a Caribbean gem from over-commercialisation. And if that's the intention, the British Virgin Islands are, for now, a resounding success.","British Virgin Islands  Attractions in British Virgin Islands  Climb Sage Mountain  Excellent views of the island and its coast can be experienced from Sage Mountain, which kisses the sky at 550m (1,800ft). The mountain sits in a gorgeous national park lined with mahoganies, hanging vines, white cedars and kapok trees. The area is well-marked with trails to explore.  Delve into Dead Chest National Park  Visitors can snorkel amidst the stunning coral gardens of Dead Chest National Park. The island is said to have been named when the infamous pirate Blackbeard put 15 mutinous men ashore with only a bottle of rum between them.  Dive down to the Rhone Marine Park  The wreck of the RMS Rhone in the Rhone Marine Park off Salt Island is a mecca for divers. The mail ship sank during the hurricane of 1867 and now lies in two sections in waters between 9m (30ft) and 27m (90ft) deep. The clear water also allows for good snorkelling of the wreck site.  Escape to Fallen Jerusalem National Park  Gloriously untouched by man this uninhabited island is home to the endangered red-billed tropicbird as well as brown boobies, laughing gulls, noddies and brown pelicans, plus sandwich, royal and bridled terns. The island's name is said to derive from the large, volcanic rocks that resemble the destroyed city.  Experience the BVI Spring Regatta and Sailing Festival  Sea lovers can set sail in the annual BVI Spring Regatta and Sailing Festival or take it easy on a luxury charter. The warm water makes for gorgeous sailing conditions, while the parties that take place on dry land are just as hot.  Peer into the caves of Norman Island  There is a world of sea-shanties and tales of treasure in Norman Island, the alleged setting for Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island. Popular with cruise boats and tourists, the uninhabited island is well-known for its sea caves that can be explored by curious divers.  Relax on the beaches  Visitors can sink into the sand and gaze upon shimmering aquamarine waters at beaches such as Smugglers' Cove, Long Bay, Brewer's Bay and Marina Cay. The white sand beaches come in all shapes and sizes, but each one provides the perfect backdrop to enjoy a glass of rum.  Stroll around the Botanic Gardens  The Joseph Reynold O'Neal Botanic Gardens on Tortola are perfect for a relaxing walk and breathing in the scent of lush, tropical plants native to the British Virgin Islands. Many of the plants in the collection are threatened and endangered and serve to build awareness of conservation on the islands.  Take a dip in The Baths  The Baths in Virgin Gorda is a unique rock formation of dimly lit grottoes and caves most of which can only be reached by foot or boat. Visitors tend to come from adjacent islands such as St Thomas and Tortola and return via the Virgin Gorda airport.  Take a hair-raising ride along Ridge Road  The drive along the Ridge Road in Tortola offers spectacular panoramic views of Cane Garden Bay. However, the sharp twists and turns of the road are not for the faint-hearted driver. At places it becomes very steep and from a safe vantage point you can take some spectacular photographs.  Take a walk on the wild side  Wildlife abounds on the island of Anegada, which is home to several rare species including the endangered Anegada rock iguana. The local economy is mainly geared towards tourism and fishing, with most of the population residing in the only village on the island, known simply as, The Settlement.  Unwind in Road Town  West Indian houses and a colourful market can be found in Road Town, the capital of the British Virgin Islands, on the south coast of Tortola. Visitors can see the ruins of Fort Burt or explore Fort Recovery, built in the 1640s. They can also get a taste of the local tipple at the Callwood Rum Distillery.",caribbean,,
lesotho,"Tucked away in the heart of South Africa sits the Kingdom of Lesotho, known to locals as the Kingdom of the Sky and to travellers as the Switzerland of Africa.      As the nicknames suggest, Lesotho is mostly made up of the rolling highlands and dramatic, rugged peaks of the Maloti Mountains, the tallest of which stands at a shade under 3,500m (11,482ft) above sea level. Lesotho is the only independent state in the world that is entirely above 1,000m (304m) altitude.      The high altitude and mountainous geography lend a spectacularly scenic backdrop to the numerous outdoor activities on offer, including pony trekking, rock climbing, fishing, abseiling, hiking, bird watching, mountain biking and even skiing on the snow-covered slopes below the Mahlasela Pass.      The existence of valuable mineral and water resources led developers to build roads through some areas of Lesotho, but much of the kingdom and its villages remain remote and can only be reached on foot, by horseback or by light aircraft.      But Lesotho’s remoteness is a large part of its appeal, and this also helps preserve the rich traditional culture of the Basotho people, which you can experience at a number of cultural villages dotted across the kingdom. Lesotho also boasts some prominent examples of ancient rock paintings made by the nomadic San people that once inhabited this area.      Since Lesotho gained its independence from the British, poverty and unemployment have seen this protectorate lose a large percentage of its population to South Africa’s mines, while those that stayed behind have had to live with one of the world’s highest rates of HIV, which in turn has had detrimental effects on the country’s economy.      But while Lesotho might not be able to boast the wealth and infrastructure of its much larger neighbour, when it comes to raw adventure and natural beauty it can certainly hold its own.","Lesotho  Attractions in Lesotho  Basotho life  Experience a taste of real Basotho life on an overnight stop in a hut in the rural areas of the remote Basotho.  Bushmen rock paintings  Witness the bushmen rock paintings of bush life and animals, near Maseru. Sites include Ha Khotso and Ha Baroana.  Horse riding  See the rugged beauty of the land by horse riding, mountain climbing and hiking. Moyeni and Mohales Hoek, in the southern region of Lesothom are popular locations for these activities.  Maletsunyane Waterfalls  View the highest single-drop fall in southern Africa. The Maletsunyane Waterfalls are three times higher than the Niagara frontier.  Maseru  Explore the highlights of Maseru, Lesotho's capital. Sights include the historic cemetery and the fascinating architecture of the King's Palace and the Prime Minister's Residence.  Motlejoeng Caves  Explore the Motlejoeng Caves, 2km (1.2 miles) south of Mahale's Hoek and the Masitise Cave House.  Moyeni  Revisit prehistory and see dinosaur footprints, many of which are still in the same place where they were discovered. Important sites include Moyeni, Qalo and Morija.  Pony trek  Embark on a pony trek through the great falls at Ribaneng, Ketane and Maletsunyane. Other treks include the Molimo Nthuse circular trip, which takes in the Qiloane Falls.  Ski  Ski in the heart of the Lesotho highlands (www.afriski.co.za).  Thaba Bosiu  See where the Basotho made a last heroic stand against the Boers in Thaba Bosiu. The flat-topped hill is where many of their chiefs are buried.  Thaba-Ts'oeu  Observe the petrified forest on the mountain of Thaba-Ts'oeu.  Trek  Trek through one of the most beautiful parts of Lesotho, the region bordering South Africa in the southeast. Places of most interest include Ramanbanta, Semonkong and the Sehlabathebe National Park.  Unique wildlife  Appreciate Lesotho's unique species of birds - over 300 species of birds have been recorded. Birds that are rare to southern Africa can be watched on a trip along the Mountain Road, a spectacular route through the centre of the country.",africa,,
guadeloupe,"A butterfly-shaped archipelago in the Caribbean Sea, Guadeloupe is a picture of tropical island idyll – no wonder the French are reluctant to let it go.      Known as Karukera to the original Caraïbe inhabitants, this French overseas region might share the same attributes as other coveted Caribbean destinations – white powdery beaches, vertiginous mountains and dazzling coral reefs – but Guadeloupe’s Franco-Caribbean culture sets the archipelago apart from its neighbours.      Ascribed by Jacques Cousteau as one of the world’s premier diving destinations, Guadeloupe was at the front of the queue when they were giving out natural beauty; from the lofty heights of La Grande Soufrière volcano to the resplendent reefs of the Pigeon Islets, this archipelago is exquisite on the eye.      Comprising eight islands and numerous small islets, Guadeloupe’s varied typography is a big draw for adventure travellers, who come to trek the terrain, ride the waves and cycle through a slice of paradise.      But the archipelago is also a hit with more sedentary travellers, who while away lazy days on sandy shores and quaff rum in ramshackle beach bars to the rousing rhythms of Guadeloupian beguine.      Each island, of course, has its own character, but few travellers have time to visit them all. Most base themselves on one of the two main islands – Basse-Terre and Grande-Terre – which are linked by dense mangrove swamps rich in wildlife.      These two islands are home to Guadeloupe’s main resorts; they are where most of the hotels and evening entertainment can be found; where you can eat at the best restaurants; and fall out of the best bars.      They are also home to the archipelago’s leading historical attractions, including forts, defunct sugar plantations and museums, which, between them, trace the DNA of modern day Guadeloupe and explain how it remains an unlikely member of the European Union.","Guadeloupe  Attractions in Guadeloupe  Bask on the beaches  From black, volcanic sands to sweeping icing sugar shores, Guadeloupe boasts some of the finest beaches in the Caribbean. Topless bathing is acceptable but do expect roving eyes. For sundowners Plage de la Perle on Grand-Terre is hard to beat with its golden sand, rustling palm trees and ramshackle beach bars. For quieter shores explore Sainte-Anne on Grand-Terre.  Climb an active volcano  Hike up La Grande Soufrière, an active volcano, which tops out at 1,467m (4,813ft) and offers a tough climb. However, the panorama that greets visitors at the summit makes it well worth the effort – from the top it is possible to see the verdant peaks of the surrounding islands. The last significant rumble was in 1976.  Explore the ruins of sugar plantations  Discovered by Christopher Columbus in 1493, the island of Marie-Galante was divided into sugar plantations by the French. Relics of these plantations dot the island, but perhaps the most interesting ruin can be found at the Murat Plantation, which was the workplace of 207 African slaves. Visitors can see the remains of a windmill and look around the plantation house.  Get wet at Carbet Falls  The Carbet Falls, located on Basse-Terre, is a series of three spectacular waterfalls in the foothills of La Grande Soufrière. Only experienced and confident hikers should attempt trekking to the first or third waterfall (where a refreshing dip awaits hardy pilgrims), but the second waterfall is easily accessible to all.  Go scuba diving along the west coast  The best dive sites can be found along Guadeloupe's west coast. The small fishing village of Anse Duché has a sunken shipwreck named L'Augustin to explore and there are several sites surrounding the Pigeon Islets, which form part of the Réserve Cousteau. The Grand Cul-de-Sac Marin Nature Reserve, a protected marine reserve in the north, also boasts large coral reefs.  Hike the National Park of Guadeloupe  The National Park of Guadeloupe boasts some 300km (188 miles) of marked trails, most of which are located in the rainforest. This balmy jungle is home to more than 100 species of orchids, 11 species of bats and several rare species of bird. The park is also home to a volcano, a mountain and a waterfall.  Imbibe ancient art  The Parc Archeologique des Roches Graves near Trois-Rivières is home to many of the rock carvings made by ancient tribes such as the Arawaks that once inhabited the Guadeloupe Islands. The park also has a beautiful tropical garden and visitors can enjoy spectacular views across the Les Saintes archipelago.  Infiltrate a French fort  Fort Louis Delgrès, on Basse-Terre, was built in 1650 by French Governor Charles Houel. The fort was the target of frequent attacks by the British Navy, which briefly seized it in 1759. It was eventually decommissioned in 1904 and classified as a national monument in 1977. For the full history, tour with a official guide on Fridays.  Join the Carnival revelry  Guadeloupe Carnival, the most eagerly anticipated event of the year, takes place in the weeks before Ash Wednesday and is a jamboree of epic proportions. Islanders dress up in colourful costumes, parade through the streets and dance until the small hours – for the best part of six weeks. It's worth going out your way for.  Kayak through the mangroves  The protected mangrove swamps of Guadeloupe abound with migratory birds, including pelicans, kingfishers and herons. These species are best viewed by taking a kayaking expedition through the mangrove forests, which are located along the western coast of the country. Kayak Canyon Guadeloupe hire kayaks by the day, while there are plenty of hiking trails through the swamps.  Quaff the local tipple  Guadeloupe's famous rum institution, Musée du Rhum, explains how the sugarcane spirit is produced and, more importantly, offers visitors a taste of the local brew. There are around 15 rums to choose from, all of which are produced by the distillery next door.   Stroll around the colonial capital  Pointe-à-Pitre is the commercial capital of Guadeloupe and is characterised by its colourful colonial buildings, bustling markets and lively inhabitants. The centrepiece of the city is the Place de la Victoire where more than 850 people were beheaded by guillotine during the French Revolution. Today, people socialise, shop and watch the world go by.  Visit the Creole Ecological Museum  Ecomusee Creole de la Guadeloupe can be found just outside the commune of Sainte-Rose on Basse-Terre. It boasts a botanical garden which contains fragrant exhibitions relating to the herbs, fruits and vegetables grown on Guadeloupe. The exhibition explores the medicinal properties of the local flora and relates the history of the islands and the different ethnic groups living on them.  Walk above the forest canopy  As well as boasting a zoo and botanical gardens, the Parc Zoologique et Botanique de la Guadeloupe, located on Basse-Terre, has a network of lofty rope bridges, which are suspended above the forest canopy. The views are excellent, but you will need a head for heights.  Walk amongst the dead in Morne-a-l'Eau  In Morne-à-l'Eau, on the island of Grande-Terre, there is an extraordinary, amphitheatre-like cemetery where narrow pathways weave between enormous crypts. Some crypts are extravagant affairs (many were designed by architects for rich families) but all are covered in black and white tiles. The chequered façades on these sepulchres represent the intermingled African and European cultures of Guadeloupe.",caribbean,,
menorca,"Less developed and more tranquil than the other Balearic Islands, Menorca appeals to those in search of relaxed sunny days far from the hustle and bustle. Hazy beach life is well and truly at the fore of the island’s draw, with an abundance of sandy strips perfect for lazing in the heat.      Across the island its Bronze Age past is still evident with Talayots sites, like the impressive ruins at Talato de Dalt. But it is the British influence (a result of the island’s capture in 1708) that has left a more lasting impression.      In the capital, Mahon, Georgian architecture remains a fixture among the old city walls, cliff top churches and tiny squares. It was here, under the influence of 18th century British sailors, that the island’s renowned gin production began.      Steep streets are a feature of the small capital, with all roads (seemingly) leading down to the turquoise sea. Portside visitors bob around an abundance of cafes, bars and restaurants, all well-served by the views of yachts and large liners making their way out to the Mediterranean Sea.      Menorca’s most attractive town is Ciutadella, just 32km (20 miles) from Mahon. Centred around Plaça des Born, its architecture is markedly Spanish, and a walk through the narrow cobbled streets of its Old Town reveal baroque churches and gothic touches that seem unmarked by modernity.      Island-wide, small-scale holiday developments have remained largely self-contained, leaving most of Menorca uncommercialised and bucolic.      Early introductions of conservation areas proved a shrewd move, protecting not only the island’s natural beauty, but also bringing Menorca sustainable tourism and UNESCO Biosphere Reserve status.      As a result, the island's most striking features remain its beaches – a glorious girdle of golden white coves and aquamarine waters, particularly in the south – which attract young and not-so-young families year after year.","Menorca  Attractions in Menorca  Ciutadella  The finest town on the island is a delight for wandering. Don't miss its superb gothic-baroque Catedral de Menorca, its picturesque arcaded shopping street, particularly Ses Voltes, and the quaint old market area.  Cova d'en Xoroi  This beautiful cave complex (www.covadenxoroi.com) is carved into the cliffside high above Cala en Porter. Watch the sunset while sipping on a cocktail at Cova d'en Xoroi then spend the rest of the evening in its nightclub.  Diving  Menorca is nicknamed the Caribbean of the Mediterranean for its excellent diving conditions. All the dive operators offer ""try dives"" which will give you a good flavour of what's below.  Explore gorgeous beaches  The idyllic Caribbean-like white sand coves of Cala Mitjana, Cala Turqueta, Cala Macarella and Cala Trébaluger are all within walking distance of Cala Galdana or take a boat from here or Cala n'Bosch. Arrive early in high season.  Mahón  The capital is a mish mash of architectural styles that shows its most attractive face from the harbour. Much of the old centre is pedestrianised and choc-a-bloc with attractive boutiques, cafes and restaurants.  Mahón Harbour  Take a boat trip around the fjord-like harbour of Mahón. It is one of the largest natural harbours in the world and gives spectacular views of the town rising up like a fortress percged on the clifftop.  Naveta dels Tudons  This extraordinary burial chamber, near Ciutadella, resembles an upturned boat and is unique to the region. It is considered to be Europe's oldest intact construction, dated around 1,500 B.C.  Stop off in Binibèquer Vell  You won't believe that this picture-postcard ""typical fishermen's village"", close to Mahon, is actually a holiday apartment complex built in 1972. It forms part of a small village where you can get a bite and a drink.  S’Albufera des Grau nature reserve  Just 5 miles (8km) from Mahon, this natural reserve is a 5,000-hectare of green fields, marshlands, forests and coastal islets, making it a prime spot for walking, cycling and bird spotting. With shallow and warm water, its beach Es Grau is particularly ideal for small children.  Take a hike around Cami de Cavalls  Only recently reopened in its entirety, the Cami de Cavalls ('path of horses') encircles the whole island, taking in spectacular views of Menorca's coast and countryside. You can walk it or travel by horse as they did in medieval times - parts of the path date back to the 14th century.  Torralba d'en Salord  This is one of the most impressive remnants of the island's Talayotic (Bronze Age) period. Its monumental taula (T-shaped) stone formations are spectacular. Other prehistoric formations worth a detour to are Talatí de Dalt and Cala Morell.  Xoriguer Distillery  Tantalise your tastebuds at the Xoriguer Distillery on Mahón harbour, famous for its gin, introduced by the British (who ruled the island from 1708-1802), and also producing a range of teeth-melting liqueurs.",europe,spain,balearic islands
gibraltar,"Gibraltar is full of surprises: from its lively population of Barbary macaques (monkeys) to its sub-tropical climate, this little British enclave on the Mediterranean is awash with wonders.      The Rock, as Gibraltar is known, is a monolithic peninsula riddled with curious caves and tunnels. Atop its limestone base thrives unique vegetation and many species of migrating birds, which combined with glorious views and stimulating walks make Gibraltar a popular destination for nature enthusiasts.      The town itself is densely concentrated on the western side of the rock; those with an interest in history should visit the Gibraltar Museum for an insight into Gibraltar's heritage of Moorish, Spanish and British rulers, while foodies will enjoy sampling fresh seafood and colourful Spanish dishes.","Gibraltar  Attractions in Gibraltar  Admire Gibraltar's architecture  Gibraltar's interesting architecture includes the 14th-century keep of the much-rebuilt Moorish Castle; the Shrine of Our Lady of Europe, a mosque before its conversion to a Christian chapel in 1462, which houses the 15th-century image of the Patroness of Gibraltar; and the Lighthouse and Mosque, which blends classic Islamic design with modern facilities.  Explore St Michael's Cave  Located inside the Rock, St Michael's Cave is situated 300m (1,000ft) above sea level, and was known to the Romans for its spectacular stalactites and stalagmites. It is part of a complex series of interlinked caves, including Leonora's Cave and Lower St Michael's Cave. Today, it is used for concerts and ballet. The Upper Galleries, hewn by hand from the Rock in 1782, house old cannons and tableaux evoking the Great Siege (1779-1783).  Feed your brain in Gibraltar Museum  See a replica of the Gibraltar Skull – the first Neanderthal skull found in Europe (1848) – and caveman tools and ornaments excavated from the Rock's caves. There are also exhibits from the Phoenician, Greek, Roman, Moorish, Spanish and British periods of the Rock's history, a comprehensive collection of prints and lithographs, and a large-scale model of the Rock made in 1865.  Find ghosts in the Convent  Head to the Convent at the end of Main Street to see the daily changing of the guards. The convent has been the residence of the governor since 1728, and was formerly a 16th-century Franciscan Monastic house. It is also rumoured that the convent is haunted by the ghost of a nun, known as the 'Lady in Grey'.  Go birdwatching  Birdwatching can be undertaken in spring and autumn, when thousands of migrating birds stop off on their way between their breeding grounds in northern Europe and their wintering areas in Africa. Owls, eagles, harriers, hoopoes, buzzards and black kites join resident species such as peregrine falcons, blue rock thrush and Barbary partridge.  Kick back on Gibraltar’s beaches  Gibraltar has some great beaches to explore. On the east side of the island are Eastern Beach and Catalan Bay. Little Bay, a pebble beach, and Camp Bay/Keys Promenade are on the western coast. Pier fishing facilities are available on the island and scuba-diving, parasailing and water-skiing can also be practised.  Pay a visit to the famous macaque monkeys  In the Apes' Den, take pictures of the famous Barbary apes, which are in fact not apes but macaque monkeys without tails. These are the only wild primates in Europe. The Spanish once said that when the monkeys left Gibraltar, the British would follow. This prompted the British PM to have more apes delivered to the Rock.  Take a guided walk  Go on a guided walking tour around the city walls, held every Friday at 1030. The walls and fortifications of the City of Gibraltar were first built by the Moors to defend the country against invasion, and have since been added to by the Spanish and British. A walk along the walls is the best way to get a glimpse into the history of the city and sites.  Take a stroll around Trafalgar Cemetery  Find the town's ancient cemetery just off Main Street, at Southport Gate. Treacherous sea battles took their toll, with many lost lives commemorated here. Browse the intricate and well-kept headstones, some dating back to 1789.  Take the cable car to Ape's Den  Take a cable car trip to the top of the Rock. Built in 1966, the Top Station is on the summit of the Rock, from where visitors can see Spain to the north and Africa to the south. The cable car journey stops at the Apes' Den, where the islands' famous primates scamper about.  Watch whales and dolphins  The Bay of Gibraltar is home to a large population of dolphins and whales, and tourists can take boat trips to view these fascinating creatures. It's easy to spot the dolphins (some operators offer guarantees), but the whales – including killer, fin and humpbacks – are a little more aloof.",europe,,
iran,"Iran ought to be one of the world’s most treasured travel destinations, blessed as it is with extraordinary historical sites, exquisite landscapes and a fascinating culture. But international tensions and a tough domestic regime have prevented that from being the case – it has remained a destination for the intrepid.      Things are changing, though. Since the election of a moderate president in 2013 and the gradual thawing of relations with the West, this once out-of-bounds country has started to open up. No one’s pretending that its current leadership can’t be shockingly hard-fisted in matters of civic law. But most foreigners are likely to find their preconceptions shattered. They will find Iranians warm and friendly, keen to practice their English and quick with the tea invites.      Rich Persian heritage dating back 3,000 years is evident throughout the country. Historical sights like the ancient ruins of Persepolis and the still-glorious former capital of Isfahan are abundant. Iran has a distinct cultural identity too, with its predominately Shia-Muslim population, which sets it apart from most nations in the Islamic world.      Parts of the country are very conservative, but Tehran will strike many visitors as extremely modern. Despite the image perpetuated of religious dogma, in the capital women walk around in skinny jeans and make-up, while couples openly hold hands. There’s a lively café culture and a youth culture comparable to Mediterranean countries. Persian cuisine can be sampled in countless traditional and more contemporary restaurants.      Ancient Persia has the potential to attract millions of tourists per year, but it's the modern reforming Iran that could be of as much interest. Flashpoint travel advice should be heeded and tourists still won’t be flocking to the country on a whim. But those who do travel will find street-level Iran to be almost unrecognisable from the Iran making headlines around much of the world.","Iran  Attractions in Iran  Admire the majesty of Golestan Palace  Arguably Tehran's key sight, Golestan was the royal home of the Qajar dynasty. The palace complex within the old city walls dates back to the Safavid dynasty, right at the beginning of Islamic Persia, but it took on its current shape largely in the 19th century with a blend of traditional Islamic architecture and Western influences.  Bask in the glittering expanse of Imam Square  Esfahan's breath-taking centrepiece is one of the largest public squares in the world, fringed by a glittering array of blue-mosaic mosques and palaces. Wander the gardens, gawp at the architecture and take time to absorb the atmosphere of this UNESCO-listed marvel.  Bling-watch at the National Jewels Museum  From ancient Persia to the 19th-century Qajar dynasty, this country has been subject to many extravagant reigns. Tehran's National Jewels Museum showcases some of the most opulent regalia you're likely to encounter anywhere in the world, including an ornamental world globe made from more than 50,000 different precious stones.  Cross the bridges of Esfahan  The bridges that cross Esfahan's Zayandeh River wouldn't look out of place in a book of fairytales, with many of them dating back to the golden era of the 1600s. The 33-arched Si-o-Seh Bridge is unmissable, while the Khaju Bridge, which is split over two levels, is similarly majestic.  Follow the old trade route to India via Kerman  Initially founded as a military outpost and subsequently established as a key trading post for those passing to and from India, Kerman has some interesting museums, a number of imposing mosques and – predictably – a gloriously hugger-mugger bazaar.  Go rug shopping  It hardly needs to be said, but there is literally no better place in the world to go shopping for Persian rugs, and throughout the city bazaars you'll find no shortage of different vendors. It's best to throw yourself into the full experience – take tea, choose a favourite and barter with a smile.  Go undercover at the US Den of Espionage  The name may make you want to laugh and cry at the same time, but this unusual museum is important for being the site of the former US Embassy in Tehran, where diplomats were once held hostage for over a year as depicted in the hit 2012 film Argo. Today the complex is perhaps best known for the sobering anti-Western murals daubed on its walls.  Hit the ski slopes  You may never have heard of skiing in Iran, but it's increasingly a big deal here. There are four downhill areas near Tehran alone, and costs are generally far lower than in Europe. The season in the Alborz Mountains lasts roughly from November until late March.  Imbibe a little shisha culture  Hubbly-bubbly, shisha, hookah, narghile: call it what you like, the omnipresent water-pipes still form an important part of local culture. It might not be overly healthy, but ordering a pipe and watching the world go by is a quintessential Iranian experience.  Meet the troglodytes of Meymand  Meymand is a troglodyte settlement carved into a range of hills near the south coast. It's estimated that people have inhabited the area for more than 3,000 years, and to this day, residents still live in natural and manmade caves.  Sample the urban charms of Tabriz  Step back in time to 15th-century Persia by visiting Tabriz with its covered Qaisariyeh Bazaar and striking Kabud (Blue) Mosque, which was first built in 1465 before being destroyed by an earthquake – it has since been faithfully restored. One of Iran's largest cities, it is amongst the country's most important industrial centres.  Scuba dive off tropical islands  Get up close to virgin coral and colourful marine life in the waters off Qeshm Island in the south. Nearby Kish Island is another good option for scuba-diving enthusiasts – the diving school offers a range of PADI courses.  See an Iranian football match  The legendary Tehran derby between Esteghlal and Persepolis is the most fiercely contested football match in the Middle East. It's a day when the entire country splits its allegiance between red and blue. Pick a side and then join more than 90,000 Iranians for a day of singing, sporting prowess and emotion.  Seek out a desert oasis  Visit the miniscule oasis village of Garmeh, surrounded by date palms and centred around a small spring. Don't expect any fancy hotels – this is all about welcoming locals and desert-village life, and as a chance to experience the profound quiet of the desert, it's second to none.  Take tea Iranian-style  Chances are high that as you make your way around the country, you'll be invited to locals' homes for tea on a fairly regular basis – Iranians are a very hospitable bunch. Forget any natural reserve and say yes, as it may well be the most rewarding thing you do in Iran.  Venture into the past in Yazd  One of the country's oldest cities through which Marco Polo is believed to have travelled, Yazd is still characterised by winding lanes, wind towers, earth-sculpted buildings and an evocative atmosphere of ages past.  Don't miss the princely Amir Chakhmaq Complex.  Visit the City of Roses, Shiraz  The City of Roses, as Shiraz is known, is synonymous with poetry, flowers and – somewhat ironically, given the nationwide alcohol ban – wine. It's long been one of the Islamic world's most celebrated cities, and there's still plenty to see, including historic mosques, pretty vineyards and exquisite public gardens.  Visit the unique Jameh Mosque  Another of Esfahan's exquisite attractions, the Jameh Mosque (not to be confused with the mosque of the same name in just about every city in the country) is a masterpiece of Islamic design. A UNESCO World Heritage Site, it was started in the 9th century and renewed continually over the centuries, taking a little bit from each phase of mosque design.  Wander the grand town of Kashan  An oasis city with a laid-back vibe, Kashan experienced lavish 19th-century building works during the illustrious Qajar era, and much of the grandeur still remains. The covered bazaar is atmospheric, and full of locally produced pottery and rugs. Visit in April, when the many rose bushes are in full bloom.  Wonder at ancient Persepolis  For many visitors, Persepolis is the over-riding reason to come to Iran. A short drive from Shiraz, Persepolis was once the ceremonial capital of the Achaemenid Empire, also known as the First Persian Empire, from the 6th to 4th centuries BC. The vast spread of deserted columns, stairways and gateways is a stirring sight.",middle east,,
greenland,"Remote Greenland is the world's biggest island, while the sea that surrounds it is either permanently frozen or chilled by the mainly cold currents. In the centre of the country, ice can be up to 3km (2 miles) thick. No wonder that most of the population huddles around the ice-free coastal region. Indeed, the name 'Greenland' is a bit of a misnomer, although there are sheep-laden green fields in the south.  Those wondering why anyone would want to inhabit such unforgiving terrain are ignoring the beautiful sights that Greenland grants. The arctic nights in the winter concoct a wondrous continuous twilight. In the far north of the country, complete darkness is coupled with the spectacular Northern Lights during the coldest months. While Greenland may not be top of many travellers' bucket lists, where else can you visit such raw and unspoilt landscapes?  The profusion of snow creates the perfect conditions for activities such as dog sledging and tour cruises, which interweave in and out of Greenland's dazzling array of fjords, mountains, islands and icebergs. You can even go kayaking in the waters, though best to play it safe. The wildlife does not disappoint, either: there is an abundance of whales, seals and birds in the area.  There are hardly any roads on the island, so expect to fork out for boat travel, or even helicopter journeys. The upshot is that glacial vistas, yawning fjords and soaring mountains are all there for the taking. Definitely bring a camera.  Although Greenland's appeal rests with its wondrous nature, there are a few thousand Greenlanders living on the sparsely populated island, and on the western coast they offer up a handful of picturesque villages. Mostly living in brightly painted wooden cottages, Greenlanders may have a reputation for being rather closed, but give them time and space, and you will discover a truly compelling culture, one that fuses both Inuit and Danish heritage.  With transport options and tourism agencies having improved travelling conditions of late, there's never been a better time to visit Greenland.","Greenland  Attractions in Greenland  Admire the architecture of Qaqortoq  The largest town in South Greenland is home to a small Inuit Museum, which includes an exact copy of a turf house. The town square is surrounded by some of the most well-preserved buildings of the colonial era, dating back 200 years. Examples of a unique art project called Stone and People, where sculptures are carved into granite, can also be found throughout the town.  Befriend the locals in Nuuk  An ever-popular destination for visitors, Nuuk ranks as one of the world's smallest capitals. With a population of about 15,000, the ""city"" was founded in 1728 by Norwegian missionary Hans Egede as the very first town of Greenland. Its colourful, wooden houses are overlooked by the snow-capped Sermitsiaq Mountain, which provides a beautiful backdrop to the town.  Discover the world's largest national park  Northeast Greenland National Park has bragging rights to being the world's largest and most northerly national park. Nearly four times the size of the United Kingdom, the park is home musk oxen, polar bears, walruses and myriad other species. The area is ideal for expedition trips in kayaks or on dog sledges. Permits are required to enter the park.  Don your hiking boots  Hiking is one of Greenland's big draws. The tourist board has published colour-coded hiking maps and guides for Qaqortoq, Narsaq and Narsarsuaq in South Greenland and Ammassalik in the east. The scenery is unremittingly beautiful and accommodation comes in the form of mountain huts, which are available in the Narsaq and Qaqortoq peninsulas, as well as Vatnahverfi.  Explore the macabre Greenland National Museum  One of Nuuk's major attractions, this morbid museum is home to the mummified remains of a group of women and children, who were thought to have died in about 1475 when their boat capsized. The museum is in the oldest part of the city where buildings date back to 1728.  Go whale watching  Many different species of whale can be found along Greenland's coasts. Try the area around Qeqertarsuaq, Aasiaat and Qasigiannguit, where, with a bit of luck, you might spot gigantic fin whales. Depending on the season, you may also get to see minke, beluga and humpback whales.  Marvel at the icebergs of Disko Bay  North Greenland, and in particular the area around Disko Bay, is one of the most popular destinations for travellers. That's thanks largely to the magnificent icebergs, which, during the summertime, glisten in the midnight sun.  Scale the heights of Nanortalik  Greenland's southernmost town, Nanortalik, is surrounded by the so-called Nanortalik Skyscrapers; the steep peaks and sheer mountain faces that rise from shimmering fjords. The area is a paradise for climbers and hikers but Ketil Mountain and Ulamertorsuaq should only be attempted by experienced hands. If you've not a head for heights, then the fishing and kayaking is also good here.  See the sights on a snowmobile  A vehicle for recreation and leisure, snowmobiles are ubiquitous in Greenland, and renting one is a great way to discover the country's beautiful scenery in winter. Not a cheap leisure activity, but one that's guaranteed to give you a huge adrenaline buzz.  Soak up the scenery in Ilulissat  Ilulissat (meaning ""iceberg"") is the gateway to Disko Bay and the whole of northern Greenland. Ilulissat boasts many modern as well as traditional buildings surrounded by breath-taking scenery. The explorer Knud Rasmussen was born here in 1879 and the house where he grew up has been transformed into the interesting Knud Rasmussen Museum.  Take a dog sled ride  The Inuit have been living with their dogs and using their sledges for thousands of years, and taking a dog-sled trip will give you an insight into their culture. This is a popular activity in Eastern Greenland and north of the Arctic Circle, with tours available for all levels and durations. Best months for this are from February to April.  Travel back to the Viking Age  Narsarsuaq and Qassiarsuk in southern Greenland are situated in the area first settled by the Viking Eric the Red 1,000 years ago. Many ruins from this epoch still survive and these Viking vestiges are popular with history buffs and hikers.",north america,,
channel islands,"As their name suggests, the Channel Islands are sprinkled across that narrow channel of sea that divides France and the UK. Made up of Alderney, Guernsey, Jersey, Sark and Herm, they are all actually much closer to France than England, but as any visitor will find, they are very British in character. There are also other, very small islands in the group, which are not normally open to visitors.      All the islands offer gorgeous, often dramatic coastlines, natural and historic harbours, a surprising range of birds and subtropical flora thanks to the warm Gulf of St Malo. You'll also find what may be the best seafood in the UK, and glimpses of a traditional British lifestyle that some say has faded from the mainland.      Most visitors land by ferry or plane at one of the biggest islands, Guernsey and Jersey, with good connections from both England and France. The passage over the channel from the UK is relatively calm and easy, while affording you a look at the white cliffs of Dover. There's also a fleet of ferries connecting the different islands, so you can easily take in all of them over a few days.      There's plenty of intriguing history surrounding the Channel Islands to boot, as you'll find on touring their museums. The Channel Islands were famously occupied in World War II, the only part of Great Britain to come under Nazi control during the conflict. You'll have the chance to explore old war tunnels and bunkers, while appreciating the bravery of the islanders in the face of a ruthless enemy.      Although people from the Channel Islands are proudly British, they are also fiercely independent – for the record, these are self-governing British Crown dependencies. People speak English, but the names of places are more French. All in all, they're a unique corner of Britain that visitors will agree are well worth a look.",Channel Islands  Attractions in Channel Islands,europe,,
laos,"Laos – officially known as the Lao People's Democratic Republic – is one of the great travel frontiers; landlocked and mountainous, swamped by jungles and promising Indian Jones adventures in remote tribal villages and ancient Buddhist caves.      With Thailand on one side and Vietnam on the other, you might expect Laos to be commercial and crowded, but this is Asia’s backwater, where life moves as slowly as the churning waters of the Mekong River, which forms the border with three countries – Myanmar, Thailand and Cambodia – as it snakes south towards the Gulf of Thailand.      A long-running civil war – during which the USA dropped millions of bombs in Laos – kept the country off the mainstream tourist circuit for many years. Unexploded ordnance and poor infrastructure continue to pose a challenge to tourism, but each year brings a new crop of upmarket accommodation to supplement the existing backpacker hostels – Laos is finally finding its feet. Eco-tourism looks set to be its trump card, taking visitors to remote tribal villages and pristine national parks teeming with weird and wonderful wildlife.      Despite this rugged outlook, the capital city, Vientiane, feels remarkably cosmopolitan, helped by a café culture left behind from when this was part of French Indochina. Dotted around its pleasantly faded, palm-shaded streets are ancient ruins, gleaming stupas and graceful colonial buildings.      The laidback atmosphere and the relative lack of modern development make Laos perhaps the most authentic and unspoiled of the Southeast Asia nations, though it competes for this title with neighbouring Myanmar. Laos is also one of the few communist countries left in the world – which should be obvious from the bureaucratic red tape and the omnipresent red stars on uniforms and state buildings.      Until 1988, tourists were banned from Laos, but now it is possible to travel all over the country. Nevertheless, there are few crowded tourist hotspots, with the possible exception of monastery-studded Luang Prabang and the overblown backpacker resort of Vang Vieng. Wherever you go in Laos, you’ll encounter the delectable Lao cuisine: a little bit French, a little bit Southeast Asian, and perfect washed down with a bottle of Beer Lao.","Laos  Attractions in Laos  Admire the sweeping lines of Wat Xieng Thong  Perhaps the grandest of all Laos temples, Wat Xieng Thong's soaring rooftops hark back to Luang Prabang's golden era. The sim (chapel) was founded in 1560, and the complex is richly decorated with coloured glass and gold. It's a stunning example of traditional Laotian architecture and hosted important royal rituals when Luang Prabang was capital of the Kingdom of Laos.  Chill out in laidback Luang Prabang  Sprawling along the banks of the mighty Mekong River, UNESCO-listed Luang Prabang is the nation's most important cultural and religious centre. Scattered around the historic centre are dozens of historic monasteries, and queues of monks wind through the city streets every morning. Travellers love Luang Prabang for its relaxed pace of life and delicious food, best sampled along the riverbank.  Cruise the mighty Mekong  The Mekong River forms the border between Laos and Thailand, and cruising this mighty waterway is the best way to experience the slow, easy rhythms of life in this Asian backwater. One stunningly romantic trip is the three-day cruise from Pakse to the ruins of Vat Phou, aboard a gorgeous converted teak barge.  Drift along a river  Floating in a tyre inner tube might sound like an unlikely tourist attraction, but travellers have been lazily bobbing along the Nam Song River at Vang Vieng ever since Laos reopened to tourism in the 1990s. Today, hedonistic Vang Vieng is a victim of its own success, but travellers still flock to tube on the river and sip beers in riverside bars.  Explore one man’s obsession in Xieng Khuan  South of Vientiane, close to the Thai border crossing at Nong Khai, the sculpture garden at Xieng Khuan was created by the eccentric monk Luang Pu Bunleua Sulilat, who devoted a lifetime to creating a representation of Buddhist heaven and hell on Earth in the form of cement statues. Vendors nearby serve grilled river fish and pounded papaya salad.  Learn to cook Laos’ delicious cuisine  If you enjoy the rich flavours of Laotian cuisine, you can learn to make the same dishes on a cooking course in Vientiane or Luang Prabang. Most classes include a visit to the local market to purchase meat, vegetables, herbs and spices, so you'll know exactly what you need when you try to make your first Laotian meal at home.  Marvel at the intricacy of Laotian silk  Laos is famous across Asia for its fine silk weaving, a tradition practiced for centuries by hill tribe villages using traditional backstrap looms. Local silk is used to make everything from shawls and sarongs to shirts and bags – the weaving village of Ban Phanom near Luang Prabang is a great place to see the weavers at work.  Meet a monk  As dawn breaks across Laos, the streets are criss-crossed by saffron-coloured lines of monks, queuing up to receive alms from local traders. It's one of the most photogenic sights in Asia, and worth getting up for every morning. Luang Prabang is probably the most scenic spot for monk watching, but this ritual unrolls in every town each morning.  Meet the local wildlife  The jungles of Laos are a hotbed of biodiversity, home to hundreds of species of birds and elusive tigers, elephants, rhinos and bears. Getting close to the wildlife involves trekking into national parks, or in the case of the Bokeo Nature Reserve near Hoay Xai, travelling through the forest canopy on zip wires in search of the illusive black gibbon.  Pause to reflect in the Pak Ou Caves  The limestone mountains of Laos are worm-holed with caverns, and many have been worshipped as shrines since time immemorial. The fascinating Pak Ou Caves, a speedboat ride north from Luang Prabang, are full of hundreds of Buddha images, left there over centuries by local worshippers. It's a ritual harking back to animist traditions, and the caves are incredibly photogenic.  Ponder the mystery of the Plain of Jars  Laos' most enigmatic sight, the Plain of Jars, near Phonsavan, is swathed in legend and mystery. The grasslands are covered in hundreds of stone jars, some weighing up to six tonnes. Local legend says they were used to ferment rice wine in the sixth century to celebrate a victory in battle, but nobody knows for sure why they were created.  Search for dolphins on the Mekong  The waterways of Laos are one of the last refuges of the critically endangered Irrawaddy dolphin, which can be spotted on the Mekong River, particularly around Si Phan Don (Four Thousand Islands). This laidback archipelago is one of the favourite backpacker hangouts in Laos, and the starting point for trips to spectacular Khone Phapheng, Southeast Asia's largest waterfall by volume.  Step back into the mists of time at Vat Phou  The ruins of lost empires lie scattered across Laos, but perhaps the most evocative site is the ruined Khmer Hindu temple complex of Vat Phou, constructed on a mountain top by the same empire builders who went on to create the mighty temples of Angkor in Cambodia. The approach by river from Pakse is almost as atmospheric as the ruins themselves.  Tour temples and markets in colonial Vientiane  With its fading French colonial architecture and handsome Buddhist wats and stupas, Vientiane is the living image of Indochina. Home to less than 800,000 people, but dotted with golden temples, this is one of the smallest, quietest and most relaxed capital cities in the world, nestled in fertile plains on the banks of the Mekong River.  Trek to hill tribe villages  Like neighbouring Thailand and Myanmar, Laos is home to thousands of tribal people, who live in peaceful isolation in the jungles of the central highlands. The most popular starting point for treks to meet tribal people is the sleepy town of Muang Xing in mountainous Luang Namtha province, which is ringed by Akha and Tai Leu hill tribe villages.  Trek to waterfalls and tribal villages on the Boloven Plateau  The Boloven Plateau in Champassak province is cloaked in jungle, dotted with hill-tribe villages, and watered by some of Southeast Asia's most impressive waterfalls. Pakse, home to many ethnic minority groups, is the region's capital and the ideal base from which to explore, with organised treks to remote villages and thundering cascades.  Watch sunset from the summit of Mount Phousi  As sunset falls over the Mekong River, the best place to catch the show is the summit of Mount Phousi in Luang Prabang, which is actually just a modest hill in the centre of the old town. A naga staircase climbs to the top, where a sacred stupa offers panoramic views over Luang Prabang and the surrounding rivers and hills.",asia,,
mozambique,"Mozambique’s messy post-colonial history and poor infrastructure mean that most visitors are cut from fairly intrepid cloth. But travelling this enigmatic and underexplored country is well worth the occasional bump in the road, both literal and metaphorical.      First and foremost amongst the country’s many attractions is its pristine Indian Ocean coastline – all 2,414km (1,500 miles) of it – which offers palm-fringed beaches, warm tropical waters, abundant marine life, great fishing, excellent diving, fantastic snorkeling and a number of idyllic islands from which you can enjoy all of the above in sweet isolation.      And then there are the parks. Though much of the country’s big game was wiped out during the desperate days of the Mozambican Civil War (1977-1992), sterling conservation efforts have seen several national parks restored to something like their former glory. Their remoteness and relative inaccessibility, compared to the parks in neighbouring South Africa, mean you’ll never be jostling for space with the masses.      Mozambique’s Portuguese heritage and faded art deco charm characterises much of the capital, Maputo, in the form of colourful, crumbling and sometimes bullet-ridden colonial buildings, which stand in stark contrast to the more modern parts of this vibrant port city. The music, the nightlife and the food are equally interesting and eclectic; head to the bustling fish market to enjoy what many locals will tell you is the best seafood in East Africa.      There is also good hiking with little-visited mountains dotted throughout the Mozambican hinterland, but extreme caution should be taken due to the large amount of leftover landmines.      Since peace returned to the country in 1992, Mozambique has been trying to piece itself back together and realise its substantial tourism potential. But for now, a large part of the country’s appeal lies in its relative obscurity from the more beaten paths of Southern Africa.","Mozambique  Attractions in Mozambique  Delve into the Indian Ocean  Go diving and snorkelling with dolphins, rays and dugong (manatee) in the country's crystal-clear Indian Ocean waters. Mozambique has a growing number of resorts that are well equipped for subaquatic activities. Highlights for divers include the reefs of Inhambane, the Bazaruto Archipelago or Quirimbas National Park.  Enjoy a night out in Pemba  Visit Pemba, a vibrant and rapidly growing coastal city that nestles on the shores of the Indian Ocean. Embrace the sweltering temperatures on the beach at Wimbe, just outside town, before heading into the Old Town for a few snifters. As well as a lively selection of bars, there are also some fine restaurants in the city.  Enjoy fantastic birdwatching  Pack your binoculars because Mozambique is an excellent place to go birdwatching. Many brightly coloured species can be found along the coast, not to mention Gorongosa National Park and Marromeu National Park, which attract twitchers from around the world.  Explore Quirimbas National Park  Bask in the sun and balmy waters of Quirimbas National Park. Dive and snorkel off its shores to appreciate the park's abundant marine life and coral reefs. Quirimbas, which stretches for 110km (68miles) along the coastline of northern Mozambique, is also home to a variety of land-bound wildlife including elephants, lions, leopards and wild dogs.  Go fishing  Mozambique offers world-class sports fishing. Black, blue and striped marlin, sailfish, dorado, kingfish, barracuda and dogtooth tuna are all possible to catch in the Mozambique Channel. The Bazaruto Archipelago is one of several popular spots for game fishing. Many fishing resorts operate a catch and release policy.  Go on safari  Take a safari through some of the country's 12 different national parks and reserves. The Big Five (elephant, lion, leopard, buffalo and rhino) can all be found here, and plenty more besides. There is a huge variety of landscapes to enjoy from coastal areas to mountains.  Hike national parks  Bring your walking boots because the cool mountains of the north and the various national parks offer good hiking. Landmines used to present a danger, but don't be deterred: in 2015 Mozambique was declared free of the deadly weapons planted during the civil war.  Keep your eyes peeled in Gorongosa National Park  Explore the jewel in Mozambique's crown: the Gorongosa National Park. Located 80km (50 miles) northwest of Beira, and open from April to October, access is provided by an airstrip at Chitengo. It's worth the effort getting there: visitors can expect superb birdwatching, plus glimpses of buffalo, elephants, hippos, zebra and more.  Kick back in the capital  Don't head straight out of Maputo: it's one of Africa's more appealing capitals, with wide avenues, relaxed street cafes and a lively cultural scene. The city museum and market are worth a look, as are the Central Railway Station and curious Iron House, both designed by Gustave Eiffel.  Marromeu National Park  Venture out to the little-visited Marromeu National Park, not far from Beira, at the mouth of the Zambesi River in Sofala Province. The main attractions are buffalo and birds, but lions, elephants and leopards are also present. It is possible to camp in the park overnight.  Relax in a luxury lodge on a white sand beach  Don't miss the stunning Bazaruto Archipelago, which comprises five tropical islands plus surrounding islets and coral reefs. Located 20km (12 miles) from the Vilanculos and Inhassoro, this beautiful area features white sandy beaches, clear waters and rich marine life including the dugong (manatee). There are plenty of luxury lodges providing accommodation.  Relax on a beautiful beach  Mozambique is not short of coastline and boasts some spectacular white sandy beaches. Popular beaches include Ponta do Ouro, Malugane (in the south), Inhambane with its beach resort of Tofo, Xai-Xai, Vilankulo and Chonguene.  Step back in time  Hop across by bridge to tiny Ilha de Moçambique (Mozambique Island), near Nampula in the north, which was the capital of the country under the Portuguese. It is a fascinating place, dotted with 17th- and 18th-century buildings and mosques, many of them from the colonial period. It has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  Track down some elephants  Take a trip to the Maputo National Reserve, also known as Maputo Elephant Park, which is on the Maputo River, 79km (49 miles) south of the city. It's also home to leopard, antelope, crocodiles, hippos, flamingos and jackals. It combines lakes, wetlands, swamp forests grasslands and mangroves.  Visit a historic island  Hop on a boat to Inhaca Island in the south of Mozambique not too far from the capital, Maputo. The island has 40km (25 miles) of beaches and reefs, a historic lighthouse and a museum of marine biology. It is a very popular spot for diving.",africa,,
madagascar,"Undoubtedly one of the world’s most fascinating destinations, Madagascar floats off the coast of Mozambique, in the turquoise waters of the Indian Ocean, and is home to some of the weirdest, most wonderful wildlife in existence. A cliché it may be, but there really is nowhere quite like it.      Up to 90% of the flora and fauna found in Madagascar is unique to the island, which was cut adrift from the African mainland millions of years ago and has evolved in sweet isolation since. Mother Nature had a chance to experiment in Madagascar, and experiment she did.      Nowadays the island is home to around a quarter of our planet’s primates and they exist in glorious variety: big and small, social and solitary, adorably cute and downright freaky. The primates’ story is played out across the animal groups: there are several hundred types of frog, dozens of bats, over a hundred snakes (mostly small, all harmless) and almost half of the world’s chameleons. It’s a similar story where flora is concerned, too.      But Madagascar is not just a nirvana for naturalists: the island offers splendid beaches, scuba diving and surfing; gnarly rock climbing and caving; lazy river trips; spectacular scenery; and warm, welcoming people with interesting beliefs and cultural practices.      The island is divided along its middle by a high plateau. Lush rainforest runs in a band down the eastern side, while drier deciduous forests lie to the west. In the far south is the unique arid spiny forest, home to the island’s wackiest plant life. Giant baobab trees populate the western regions.      A mix of influences provides telltale evidence of the Polynesian settlers, Arabic presence, Bantu tribes-folk and European arrivals of the past, all of which have culminated in a fascinating cultural melting pot. For sheer diversity, Madagascar hard to beat.","Madagascar  Attractions in Madagascar  Admire majestic architecture at the Queen's Palace  The rova (palace) surveys the capital city from its highest point, recently partly rebuilt following a terrible fire in 1995. The original wooden palace was built by Frenchman Jean Laborde in 1839 – its exterior was later clad in stone by Scottish missionary, James Cameron. Take a tour of the compound to learn about Madagascar's dramatic royal history.  Call in at Andasibe-Mantadia National Park  Close to the capital, this is Madagascar's most accessible rainforest reserve, and also one of the most rewarding. Frogs, reptiles and birds abound, but top of the bill is the indri, the largest of all living lemurs. These creatures sing a haunting song (reminiscent of whale song), which carries for miles across the forest.  Cameras at the ready for Baobab Alley  This natural avenue of imposing Grandidier’s baobabs is one of Madagascar’s must-see sights. Located some 35 minutes from Morondava, on the dusty track to Kirindy Reserve, Baobab Alley is best visited around sunrise or sunset because the softer lighting brings out the red tones of the tree trunks and makes for a splendid photo opportunity.  Capture the craftsmanship of Antsirabe  See the wonderful arts and crafts in Antsirabe: taking a pousse-pousse tour of artisanal workshops is the thing to do in this bustling highland town. Marvel at the skill of local craftsmen creating toys from recycled tin cans, wooden sculptures, zebu-horn jewellery, polished gems and minerals, embroidered tablecloths, silk scarves, raffia handicrafts and more.  Enjoy a tea break at the Sahambavy Estate  For almost half a century, this estate has been producing green tea (and black tea since 2004). The 335ha (828-acre) plantation yields more than 550 tonnes of tea every year, most of which is destined for Kenya. Guided factory tours take around one hour and end with a tasting.  Explore the afterlife at Ambalavao  Dabble in the macabre at Ambalavao (the so-called ""home of the departed"") where the revered bones of exhumed ancestors lie. The spectacular crags of Ambondrome and Ifandana were the site of a mass suicide in 1811, though the region is also known for its Ataimoro paper and silk weaving today.  Explore the otherworldly Spiny Forest  Unique to Madagascar, the dry and inhospitable spiny forest of the far south is a most curious and startling ecosystem. All of its botanical wonders are perfectly adapted to this tough environment, often preserving precious water in their swollen succulent forms protected by vicious prickles. The strange waving fingers of octopus trees add to the habitat's otherworldly feel.  Explore the palaces of former capital, Ambohimanga  Perhaps the most sacred site in all Madagascar, Ambohimanga (Blue Hill) was the original capital when the great king Andrianampoinimerina began his reign in 1787. The compound is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and comprises more than a dozen impressive stone gates, the king's house and various elegant royal summerhouses.  Find out about flora at Arboretum d'Antsokay  Near to Tuléar, this botanical garden showcases some 900 plant species endemic to Madagascar's arid south. You'll learn about the plants and how they are used in construction, food and medicine. Birders will also find this place rewarding and there are some bungalows for those wishing to linger.  Follow the scent to Nosy Be  Follow the exotic perfumed lure of Nosy Be and the surrounding islets of Nosy Komba (famous for its black lemurs), Nosy Sakatia and Nosy Tanikely (a marine reserve with exceptional snorkelling). On Nosy Be itself, sweet-smelling plants such as ylang-ylang, vanilla, lemongrass and patchouli fill the air with a delectable fragrance.  Look at the lemurs of Montagne d'Arbre National Park  Discover waterfalls, orchids and lemurs at Amber Mountain. This 18,500ha (45,715-acre) national park is the country's oldest, protecting some splendid montane rainforest. Ranging in altitude between 850m (2,790ft) and 1,475m (4,840ft), the mountain has its own microclimate. Sanford's lemurs and crowned lemurs are easily seen, as well as countless reptiles and birds.  Meander the Tsiribihina River mangroves  Spend three to five days floating down the tranquil Tsiribihina River to the east coast, ending up near to Tsingy de Bemaraha National Park. If you want to get off the beaten track, then other less touristy rivers include the Manambolo, Mangoky, Mahavavy, Betsiboka and Onilahy.  Ride the breaks at Libanona Beach  Grab your surfboard and hit the waves that break on offshore coral reefs to experience the island's little-known surf thrills. The surf at Libanona Beach in Fort Dauphin is suitable for beginners. Other top riding spots include Lavanono and Anakao, while the far northeast of Madagascar is the place for kitesurfing.  Seek out spectacular sea life, Mitsio Archipelago  The Mitsio islands have fantastic beaches, glorious turquoise waters, and some truly world-class dive sites. Revel in the deep-water discovery of boxfish, barracuda, rays, sea urchins, starfish, eels, and a thousand other creatures of the reef. The area is best explored by chartering a catamaran from Nosy Be.  Swim in seclusion at Anakao  Relax on the idyllic beaches in this isolated southwestern Vezo fishing village. On offer are pirogue (dugout canoe) trips to nearby mangroves and islands, including one that's home to the world's southernmost breeding colony of red-tailed tropicbirds. A day trip to the salt lake at Tsimanampetsotsa National Park is a must.  Walk the history-rich hills of Antananarivo  Revel in the distinctively French flavour and ambience of Madagascar's history-rich capital. The quaint winding streets and vast markets are best explored on foot, but you can't go far without a steep climb – this city is built on seven hills. For the best views across all of Antananarivo, head to the area around the Queen's Palace.  Wander the rugged beauty of Tsingy de Bemaraha National Park  Delve into one of the most striking national parks on the planet. At Tsingy de Bemaraha, there are undisturbed forests, lakes and canyons  – but top of the bill is the incredible limestone karst known as tsingy. These vast forests of limestone pinnacles make for a landscape unlike any other.  Witness the watery wonders of Lake Itasy  Explore the lush, volcanic region of Ampefy, renowned for its spectacular geysers and waterfalls on the banks of beautiful Itasy Lake. Amidst rolling hills, the thunderous torrents of Chute de la Lily's cascades are an unforgettable highlight – but be prepared for a reverberating roar.",africa,,
sri lanka,"Southern India meets Buddhist Asia; Sri Lanka is a land of ancient ruins and religious relics, palm-fringed beaches and colourful reefs, balmy rainforests and local legends.      With memories of civil war receding, and a new government intent on healing the scars of the past, this sun-kissed island nation looks set to regain its position as the holiday capital of the Indian Ocean.      Life in Sri Lanka is dictated by the sea. Monsoon winds create the seasons, rainbow-coloured fishing boats deliver the bounty of the Indian Ocean to the nation’s tables and tropical surf washes endlessly against the island’s golden beaches. For many, this is the perfect introduction to the Indian Subcontinent.      While Hinduism holds sway in nearby India, Buddhism dominates Sri Lanka. Ancient temples and enigmatic dagobas (stupas) enshrine relics of Buddha, shaded by saplings taken from the tree under which the Buddha attained enlightenment. At times, Sri Lanka’s Hindu, Christian and Buddhist minorities have struggled in the face of Buddhist domination, but it has shaped this island nation for millennia.      Across Sri Lanka, the ruins of ancient cities emerge from the jungle, while the remnants of Indian, Portuguese, Dutch and British settlements add to the delightful mishmash of historic architecture. Perhaps the most evocative monuments are Sri Lanka’s ancient monasteries, which are still major centres for pilgrimage and devotion, particularly during the island’s epic festivals.      In the Hill Country, the centre of the British occupation, colonial-era trains still wind their way through tea plantations and cascading paddy fields, but this highly populated little island is far from frozen in time: the coastline is peppered with modern resorts, beach bars, bronzed surfers and boutiques full of designer swimwear.      Elsewhere the forests of Yala, Udawalawe and other national parks teem with monkeys, leopards and wild elephants, while sea turtles, dolphins and blue whales can be spotted around the coast. Not bad for an island similar in size to South Carolina.","Sri Lanka  Attractions in Sri Lanka  Bask on Sri Lanka’s many Beaches  Sri Lanka has roughly 1,600km (1,000 miles) of beautiful palm-shaded beaches, and Negombo – conveniently close to the airport – boasts one of the best. Other popular resorts include Beruwela, Bentota, Mount Lavinia and Hikkaduwa. Meanwhile Unawatuna near Galle claims to be among the top 15 beaches in the world. The beaches of the south are less populated and often more beautiful, but be aware that swimming can be dangerous in many areas.  Climb Adam’s Peak  Sri Lanka's highest mountain is deeply ingrained in Sri Lankan folklore. Also known as the Sacred Footprint – because of an indentation at the summit said to belong to Adam (of Adam and Eve fame) – Buddhists, Hindus, Muslims and Christians all consider it a holy place and a popular pilgrimage site, with over 5,000 steps to the top.  Discover the reefs of Bentota  The beaches of Bentota might have seen better days, but this is still one of the top places in the country to enjoy diving and snorkelling. Glimpse the country's thriving coral reefs and their myriad multi-hued inhabitants, explore underwater caves and lose yourself among barnacled shipwrecks. Kite-surfing, water-skiing and a host of other water sports are also available here.  Explore ancient Anuradhapura  Wonder at the extraordinary civilization that ruled from the ancient capital of Anuradhapura thousands of years ago. Its majestic remains testify to an advanced city carefully planned and filled with beautiful palaces, temples and giant stupas.  Get active in Kitulgala  Sri Lanka's adventure capital is tucked away amid the ravines of the hill country. It offers an array of activities for adrenaline junkies, including kayaking, mountain biking and rainforest trekking. For a real rush, book yourself onto a beginner level or advanced white-water rafting experience on the wild Kelani River.  Go diving around Pigeon Island  Off the northeastern shore of Sri Lanka, this island is surrounded by a limestone reef which harbours 100 species of coral and more than 300 different types of fish. Declared a marine sanctuary in 1963, it's a prime destination for divers… and pigeons.  Go on safari in Yala National Park  Explore Sri Lanka's most popular wildlife-viewing destination, Yala National Park, on the southeastern coast. It is home to the world's highest density of leopards, as well as a wealth of other species – from elephants to birds. Another great place to do a bit of leopard spotting is in the Wilpattu National Park.  Have a cuppa in Ella  This delightful colonial village in the heart of Sri Lanka's Hill Country is a focus for the tea trade. Inhale the fragrant aromas of Victorian-era tea factories, drink their finest and roam the lush tea plantations that extend for miles around. The Nuwara Eliya hill station is also a popular destination.  Imbibe city life in downtown Colombo  In Colombo, root out bargains in the Pettah market, marvel at the blossoms in the Vihara Maha Devi Park between March and early May, and sample the offerings of some of the country's best restaurants. Vel Festival, which takes place during July and August in the capital, is also spectacular.  Kick back in Kandy  Visit Kandy, a picturesque town that was the last stronghold of the Kandyan Kings. It is now a cultural sanctuary where age-old customs, arts, crafts, rituals and ways of life are well preserved. Its fabulous UNESCO-listed Temple of the Tooth (also known as Sri Dalada Maligawa) shelters the sacred tooth relic of the Buddha. Kandy hosts the annual Esala Perahera, an annual festival featuring parades of glittering elephants, dancers and drummers.  Marvel at Dambulla Cave Temples  These impressively conserved temples are a unique insight into Sri Lanka's Buddhist heritage. Tucked away beneath a massive rocky outcrop, they shelter an extensive collection of religious murals and exquisite Buddhas in a variety of positions. The views are fabulous too.  Pay a visit to Buddha at Polonnaruwa  See the huge reclining Buddha at Polonnaruwa, an ancient capital and another UNESCO World Heritage Site renowned for its remains of royal palaces, temples and stupas. It also has the superb Polonnaruwa museum, one of the country's best.  Ride the waves in Talalla  This glorious hidden beach on Sri Lanka's choppy south coast is a mecca for surfers. Other top spots with an international reputation include Hikkaduwa, Midigama and Arugam Bay (near Potuvil) on the east coast. Across the best time to go surfing is from April through to October, although on the south west coast the months between November and April can be equally as good.  Take a hike in Knuckles Range  Shaped like a giant fist, this rugged mountain range in the central south of Sri Lanka experiences much cooler temperatures than the rest of the country, making it perfect for hiking. Don your all-terrain boots and head for the hidden village of Meemure, where the villagers will happily lend beds to visitors for a modest fee.  Visit Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage  This orphanage for Asian elephants is one of the most popular tourism attractions in Sri Lanka, but it's not everyone's cup of tea. Though there are ample opportunities to feed the beasts and watch them bathe in a nearby river, ultimately they are not wild animals and are handled firmly by the resident mahoots.  Walk atop Galle Fort  Ramble around coastal ramparts, colonial villas and atmospheric streets in the striking Dutch fort of Galle, another UNESCO World Heritage Site. Perhaps the most atmospheric of Sri Lankan towns, cobbled streets are lined with colonial villas and hotels. Its literary festival is one of the best in Asia. Galle is also a centre for crafts that include lace making, ebony carving and gem polishing.  Wander around Sigiriya Rock Fortress  Be amazed by Sri Lanka's best-known attraction, UNESCO-listed Sigiriya Rock Fortress. This stunning fifth-century palace-fortress perches atop a towering rock outcrop above the plains in the country's centre. Steps lead up from water gardens below and past murals of heavenly nymphs.  Watch a game of cricket R. Premadasa Stadium  Cricket is played on every scrap of land in Sri Lanka, but the R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo is probably the best place to catch a few overs. This vast international stadium hosts some of the biggest matches played in the country. It was the setting for the famous 1997 match, when Sri Lanka scored a record 952 runs for 6 wickets against India.  Watch whales off Mirissa  This southern port town would be just another tropical beach resort - were it not for the pod of blue whales recently discovered living just offshore. Now Mirissa is rightly famous as one of the best places in the world to spot the biggest mammal of them all. Whale watchers often see sperm whales, dolphins, flying fish and even orcas too.  Watch wildlife in Udawalawe National Park  Spy on Sri Lanka's abundant wildlife (much of which is found nowhere else on Earth) in this spectacular national park. Birdwatching is superb, and as well as the famous elephants there are also leopards, deer, bears, wild boar, porcupines and monkeys to see.",asia,,
mongolia,"Mongolia is far-flung and hardly well-trodden, but do not let that put you off. There is so much to see and do in this sizeable Central Asian country, from the stunning scenery and wildlife of mountains and deserts to the emerging luxury hotels and restaurants in the capital, Ulaanbaatar.      In the ancient land of Mongolia, history buffs and culture vultures will find plenty to keep them entertained. Outside of the main cities, many Mongolians continue to hold on to the traditional life of herdsmen. Residing in portable felt and canvas tents (known as 'ger'), the modern-day Mongolian nomads move from one place to another in search of shelter, water supply and food for themselves and their animals.      Mongolia's vast areas of wilderness, from the sprawling Gobi Desert to the snow-peaked mountains located in the Bayan-Ölgii Province, offer plenty of scope for adventurous outdoor enthusiasts. Fishing, jeep tours, horse and camel riding, mountain biking and birdwatching are but a few of the activities on offer. Intrepid visitors can also explore numerous temple ruins like Mañjuśrī Monastery on the slopes of Bogd Khan Mountain or Ongi Monastery in the Dundgovi Province.      While infrastructure remains relatively underdeveloped in vast swathes of rural Mongolia, elsewhere the country is racing headlong into the 21st century. The capital Ulaanbaatar is transforming at a pace that any returning visitors will find dizzying. In a relatively short space of time, the city has turned into an ultra-modern metropolis with international restaurants, five-star hotels, shopping malls and glass tower blocks – a sure sign of Mongolia's status as an up-and-coming Asian travel hotspot.      While there is plenty of nightlife and excitement in Ulaanbaatar, do not visit Mongolia without exploring the wild, largely unspoilt landscapes and traditional lifestyle of its inhabitants. Leaving the capital does not mean being stranded from civilisation. Internet is now available even in small villages and it is not uncommon to see nomads toting mobile phones. It is perhaps this contrast that makes Mongolia such a fascinating destination to visit today. Get planning your trip now before the tourist hordes inevitably catch on.","Mongolia  Attractions in Mongolia  Altai Tavan Bogd National Park  Dotted with clear lakes, lush valleys and snow-covered peaks, this park near the Xinjiang (China) border is home to varied animal species such as ibex, mountain sheep, beech marten and Golden eagle. You can hike, rent a mountain bike, ride a horse or a camel to explore the park. Within and near the park, you can find three rock art sites, namely Tsagaan Salaa-Baga Oigor in Ulaankhus, as well as Upper Tsagaan Gol and Aral Tolgoi in Tsengel (together, they make up the UNESCO-listed Petroglyphs Complexes of the Mongolian Altai).  Camping  In this land without fences, you can pitch your tent at about any place that pleases you. Some of the best spots to do so are in Gorkhi-Terelj National Park and Altai Tavan Bogd National Park. Car camping is also an option.  Cross-country skiing  The vast steppes of Mongolia get plenty of snow in winter, making the country a great place for cross-country skiers. A good place to start is Gorkhi-Terelj National Park, which has ger camps operating in the winter months.  Genghis Khan Statue Complex  Outside the Gorkhi-Terelj National Park lies the gleaming 40m (131-ft) tall Genghis Khan Equestrian Statue, the star attraction at the Genghis Khan Statue Complex. It is said that the statue faces east towards his birthplace, Delüün Boldog. Visitors can get up to the top of the statue and enjoy stunning views. There is also a small but wonderful museum on-site. Most visitors combine this with a trip to Gorkhi-Terelj National Park.  Gobi Desert  The vast Khongor sand dunes are what most people associate the Gobi region with, but in reality much of the Gobi consists of bare rocks and not sand dunes. The best way to experience the region is by visiting the Gobi Gurvansaikhan National Park and its two major attractions: Khongorinn Els (Singing Sands) and the ice-filled gorge of Yolyn Am.      At the edge of Gobi Gurvansaikhan National Park is Bayanzag (Flaming Cliffs). It was here that explorer and zoologist Roy Chapman Andrews and his team found the fossilised remains of Cretaceous animals such as Protoceratops and Velociraptor in 1922. The massive red-tinted rocks rising from the ground are also attractive, particularly when the sun is low in the horizon and seems to intensify the shades of red and orange.  Gorkhi-Terelj National Park  About 65km (40 miles) northeast of Ulaanbaatar is the magnificent Gorkhi-Terelj National Park. This verdant corner of Mongolia is best for hiking, horseback riding and birdwatching in the summer, and cross-country skiing and dog-sledding in the winter. Popular attractions within the park include the 'Turtle Rock' (a giant rock formation that resembles a turtle), the Aryabal Meditation Temple (a relatively recent construction to harness the area's natural energies) and the protected Gunjiin Sum (the 300-year-old 'temple of the princess'). Most people combine this park with a visit to the Genghis Khan Statue Complex.  Homestay  For a truly authentic experience, try to arrange a night in a traditional Mongolian ger or yurt (tent). Staying with a nomad family is a fascinating experience and full of surprises. You will get to taste local food, ride horses and help herd the sheep.  Khentii Province: Genghis Khan's birthplace  Delüün Boldog in Khentii Aimag or Khentii Province is said to be the birthplace of Genghis Khan. The place is marked by a large rock with an inscription in old Mongol script. The landscape of Khentii is beautiful, with beautiful lakes, rolling mountains and clear streams.  Khövsgöl Nuur National Park  The crown jewel of this park is Lake Khövsgöl, aka the 'Blue Pearl of Mongolia' or 'Dalai Ej', meaning Mother Sea. This lake is home to Sukhbaatar III, the single tugboat of Mongolian Navy which was privatised in 1997 (the country does not have a navy now). Today, the boat transports passengers and goods across the lake. In winter, tour companies offer skating and dog-sledding trips over the frozen lake.  Monasteries  Only a few monasteries survived the Stalinist Purges of the late 1930s and worthy diversions include:    • Erdene Zuu Monastery in Kharkhorin    • Amarbayasgalant Monastery in the Iven Valley near the Selenge River    • Tövkhön Monastery, 47km (29 miles) southwest of Kharkhorin    • Gandantegchinlen Monastery in Ulaanbaatar  Naadam Festival  Held every July 10 to 13, this nomad sports extravaganza features horse racing, wrestling and archery, as well as cultural performances of Khöömei overtone singing (aka Tuvan throat singing) and Biyelgee dance. It is a great time to see Mongolians decked out in their festive gear and taking part in traditional sporting events. The biggest naadam is in Ulaanbaatar but more intimate naadam festivals are held all around the country.  Orkhon Valley Cultural Landscape  The UNESCO-listed Orkhon Valley Cultural Landscape covers an extensive area of pastureland on both sides of the Orkhon River. The site was thought to be first settled by humans some 62,000 to 58,000 years ago. Throughout centuries, it continued to attract different tribes and cultures. Today, the most famous sites are the ruins of Karakorum, the ancient capital established by Genghis Khan in 1220, as well as the Erdene Zuu Monastery.  Ulaanbaatar  The capital of Mongolia, Ulaanbaatar, is changing at a drastic rate. Once a remote outpost, Ulaanbaatar is now a city with gleaming skyscrapers. It also boasts a string of museums and cultural highlights, including:    • National Museum of Mongolia    • International Intellectual Museum    • Winter Palace of the Bogd Khan (aka the Bogd Khan Palace Museum)    • Central Museum of Mongolian Dinosaurs    • Fine Arts Zanabazar Museum    • Mongol Costumes Museum    • Choijin Lama Temple Museum    • Gandantegchinlen Khiid (aka Garden Khiid)    • Tumen Ekh Folk Song and Dance Ensemble      The State Department Store (Ikh Delguur) is a landmark along the Peace Avenue. Around the corner you will find a quirky site called Beatles Statue which is, needless to say, dedicated to the Fab Four.",asia,,
canada,"Whether you’re a hardcore adrenaline junkie, a wildlife enthusiast or a city slicker looking for cutting-edge culture, Canada ticks all the boxes. The world’s second-largest country (by total area) racks up an astonishing diversity of landscapes; the vast Canadian Prairies rise abruptly to the glacier-topped Rocky Mountains; rugged, unspoiled coastlines give way to immense forests and emerald lakes; and Arctic waters lap upon frozen tundra. Incredibly, this wilderness is also home to cosmopolitan cities, quirky towns and remote indigenous settlements.      Canada’s people are as varied as the landscapes; from the Arctic Indigenous peoples and the Francophone Quebeckers to the British expatriates and burgeoning Asian community, this is a multicultural land where around 22% of the population are foreign-born.      Canadian cities are progressive, vibrant and regularly feature on lists of ""best places to live"". Toronto, a veritable patchwork of charming neighbourhoods, has an idyllic beachside location on the shore of Lake Ontario, while Canada’s capital city, Ottawa, contains a clutch of fantastic museums and the gorgeous Rideau Canal for ice skating in winter. Montreal’s skyscrapers belie its French heritage, but look closer and you can stumble upon historic, cobbled streets and centuries-old customs.      A stone’s throw from the Canadian Rockies, booming Calgary flaunts its cowboy traditions during the annual boot-stomping Stampede. Chilled-out Vancouver, meanwhile, seems to have it all: mountains, beaches, an incredible downtown park and a cosmopolitan dining scene. And across the Georgia Strait, Vancouver Island offers a wide variety of things to see and do including marine and land activities and festivals.      For something wilder, ski steep chutes in British Columbia, kayak secluded bays with whales in Nova Scotia or learn to lasso at an Albertan ranch. Capture grizzlies on camera in the Yukon, watch mammoth icebergs drift past the Newfoundland coast, or soar over Niagara Falls by helicopter.

In Canada, the options are endless.","Canada  Attractions in Canada  Drive the Cabot Trail  One of the world’s most scenic drives, the Cabot Trail loops 298km (185 miles) round Nova Scotia’s Cape Breton Island, hugging the coastline and traversing Cape Breton Highlands National Park. Take in pretty fishing villages and picturesque beaches, enjoy spectacular hiking and horse-riding trails, paddle hidden coves and revel in the region’s Celtic musical heritage.  Experience the tundra of Baffin Island  Canada's largest island is a pristine wilderness of fjords, mountains, glaciers and tundra. Sledge across frozen Frobisher Bay, spot whales, seals and polar bear cubs from the floe edge, gawp at colossal icebergs, encounter caribou, musk-ox and migrating birds, kayak amid jaw-dropping scenery, and discover Inuit traditions.  Gaze down on Toronto  Canada’s largest metropolis curls along the rim of Lake Ontario. Steel your nerves and gaze through glass floors from 346m (1,135ft) up on the CN Tower, explore the vibrant cafés, boutiques and galleries of the Distillery District’s beautifully restored Victorian industrial architecture, or grab an ice-cream and some rays on the beach.  Get soaked under Niagara Falls  Thunderous, mighty and mesmerising: the spectacle of up to 170,000 cubic m (6 million cubic ft) of water roaring down the equivalent of a 20-storey building is truly stunning. Sail to the base of the Canadian Horseshoe Falls aboard the classic Maid of the Mist tour, soar overhead on a helicopter or crank up the adrenaline on a nail-biting jetboat trip through Niagara Gorge.  Have an adventure in Banff National Park   Picture Canada and you might imagine dramatic, jagged mountains criss-crossed by glacier-fed rivers and peppered with vivid, emerald lakes. For an imagination-come-true experience, look no further than Banff National Park. Canada’s oldest national park sits at the heart of the Canadian Rockies; highlights include stunning cerulean Lake Louise and the striking peaks and shimmering glaciers of the Icefields Parkway.  Kluane National Park and Reserve  A UNESCO World Heritage site since 1979, Kluane National Park in the Yukon is a vast expanse of vertiginous mountains, gigantic glaciers and extraordinary wildlife. At its heart is Canada’s highest peak, 5,959m (19,550ft) Mount Logan. Raft, hike or canoe through this exceptionally beautiful backcountry, home to eagles, grizzlies, wolves and moose.  Learn the history of Quebec City  UNESCO-listed Old Quebec is Canada’s only remaining walled city, its charming 17th- and 18th-century houses a world away from the glitzy skyscrapers elsewhere. Gaze up at the impressive Château Frontenac, explore the star-shaped citadel, or track down local arts and crafts and pause at tantalising bistros in the Petit-Champlain district.  Roam the Prairie provinces  Comprising Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, the Prairies’ expansive grasslands in the south give way to parkland and coniferous forests further north. Swim, sail or waterski in one of Saskatchewan’s 100,000 lakes and rivers, spy polar bears and beluga whales in Churchill, Manitoba or hunt for fossils in Alberta’s Dinosaur Provincial Park.  Say bonjour to Montreal  Romantic yet cutting edge, North American with a distinctly French flair, the nation’s second most populated city dazzles and enchants. Wander the elegant, cobbled streets of Old Montreal, potter among the quirky stores, funky cafés and colourful houses of bohemian neighbourhood Le Plateau or soak up some serious tunes during the world’s largest jazz festival in June and July.  See whales off the Bay of Fundy  This 274km-long (170 miles) bay stretches between the Atlantic provinces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia and possesses the world’s highest tidal range – sometimes 15m (49ft) or more. Witness the inter-tidal zone’s incredible changes, go whale watching, then take an exhilarating rafting trip on the Shubenacadie River tidal bore or a thrilling jetboat ride on Saint John’s Reversing Falls.  Spot an iceberg off the Twillingate Islands  Newfoundland’s Twillingate Islands are considered one of the best places in the world to see icebergs. Hop aboard an ocean cruise between May and August to glimpse hunks of ice the size of a five-storey house as well as humpback whales, dolphins and an astonishing array of seabirds.

Listen out for the ‘singing sands’ at Basin Head, dig for clams at Tea Hill or stargaze at Cavendish in PEI National Park.  Visit Vancouver  Nestled beneath the towering Coast Mountains on the shores of the Pacific Ocean, Canada’s gorgeous west coast city exudes an easy-going, cosmopolitan vibe. Ski or hike Grouse Mountain, cross the dizzying Capilano Suspension Bridge, bike or blade round the Stanley Park seawall, or hit Chinatown for some top-notch dim sum.  Whistle down the side of Whistler  Two mountains, 3,307 hectares (8,172 acres) of terrain, 1,609m (almost 5,280ft) of vertical and over 11m (38ft) of average annual snowfall: Whistler beats its rivals hands down. This is the place to ski or snowboard in North America, thanks to an abundance of powder-filled bowls, magical glade runs, gnarly chutes and cruisy slopes, alongside a lively pedestrianised village.  Witness the Northern Lights  The ethereal lights of the Aurora Borealis are frequently visible in the Northwest Territories.

lanzarote,"Lanzarote is an island of extraordinary beauty and spectacular contrasts; a place of black deserts and white houses; limpid lagoons and rolling surf; soaring volcanoes and sweeping sandy beaches. It’s bleak and beautiful, stark and stunning.      Unlike its bigger, brasher neighbours to the west – Tenerife and Grand Canaria – Lanzarote has refrained from selling out to stack-‘em-high-sell-‘em-cheap package holidays and favoured a more sustainable, intimate brand of tourism.      It’s not devoid of big resorts and bustling beaches – with 300 days of sunshine annually the island has an obvious appeal amongst sun-seeking Europeans – but, despite this, Lanzarote has retained a traditional charm and authentic aesthetic that many find lacking elsewhere on the Canary archipelago.      This is thanks largely to César Manrique, the late, great artist and architect who turned Lanzarote and its people onto the merits of sustainable development. Manrique is behind some of the island’s most revered attractions; from urban murals and intriguing art installations to cosy cave bars and verdant cactus gardens.      Manrique’s legacy, not to mention Lanzarote’s stunning scenery, remain a big draw for travelling artists, who come from all over the world to visit the island. They tackle the local landscapes rather differently to the many sports enthusiasts, who come to test their mettle in what is considered to be one of Europe’s top outdoor destinations.      It’s easy to see why Lanzarote has gained such a reputation; the island’s smooth, straight roads are a veritable paradise for cyclers, while its dried lava fields and lofty hiking trails offer perfect conditions for runners and ramblers.      Of course, there's plenty of sand, sea and Sangria for those who want it, but ultimately, for most visitors, Lanzarote’s appeal lies not in its opportunities for boozy beach holidays, but in its untamed natural beauty, traditional charm and strong artistic heritage, which lure many back for repeat visits.","Lanzarote  Attractions in Lanzarote  Bask on beautiful beaches  Home to arguably the best beaches in the Canary Islands, the jewel in Lanzarote's coastal crown is the stunning Papagayo Beach on the southern tip of the island. Set in a sheltered cove, its golden sands are the perfect place to top up the tan and go for a paddle.  Call in at the Cesar Manrique Foundation  The late artist, Cesar Manrique, was the architect behind some of Lanzarote’s most outlandish buildings. However, his finest work can be found at the Cesar Manrique Foundation (www.cesarmanrique.com), which occupies the artist’s former home. Typically, this is no ordinary home; Manrique converted air pockets in the nearby lava fields into rooms, where he lived and worked until his untimely death in 1992.  Cruise to La Graciosa and Alegranza  If you have a day free hop aboard a sailing boat or ferry in Orzola and cruise to the nature reserve of Alegranza, the most northerly point of the Canary Islands and the only Atlantic nesting spot for the rare Eleonora's falcon. Continue your sailing sojourn with a detour to the tiny volcanic island of La Graciosa, where crystal clear seas and white sand beaches await.  Delve into Lanzarote’s pirate history  The oldest fortification on Lanzarote, Santa Barbara Castle was built in the 16th century to keep pirates at bay. Today it houses the Museo de la Piratería (www.museodelapirateria.com), which offers room after room of exhibits about Lanzarote's cursed relationship with pirates over the centuries. The views are spectacular, too.  Eat volcano-roasted chicken  Lanzarote's most popular tourist attraction, Timanfaya National Park is a protected volcanic reserve formed during a mega eruption in 1730. The volcanic activity continues to this day, much to the delight of diners at El Diablo, whose chefs cook chicken and other Canary island specialities over a geothermal barbecue. If you're not feeling peckish you'll soon work up an appetite hiking in the national park, which features geysers and a unique variety of flora and fauna.  Explore the cosy capital  The capital of Lanzarote, Arrecife is a small port city, North African in style. Kick back on the lovely and uncrowded Playa Del Reducto beach; head to the pretty Charco de San Ginés for a waterfront stroll and visit Castillo de San José for modern art installations in an incongruously kitsch castle.  Go underground at Cueva de los Verdes  Explore the rabbit warren of subterranean caves and grottos at Cueva de los Verdes, where visitors will find caverns the size of cathedrals and secret Lord of the Rings-esque passageways. An underground world of extraordinary beauty, do expect crowds during peak season.  Marvel at the green lagoon of El Golfo  One of the most photographed geological sights on the island, Charco de los Clicos (green lagoon) is a natural, ochre-coloured pool made all the more spectacular by the black volcanic backdrop. The lagoons is located a short walk from the town of El Golfo, which is well-known for its delicious fish lunches.  Ride the waves  Lanzarote's golden sands are not just for sun-seekers, you know; the island's windy coastline makes it a magnet for water sports enthusiasts. Playa Las Cucharas in Costa Teguise is a favourite with windsurfers and La Famara is where to go if you like kitesurfing. Surfing is also popular around the island.  Slip into a different world at Jameos del Agua  More César Manrique magic is woven into this natural underground lagoon, which has been landscaped into a fairy grotto. Spiral staircases and palm fronds lead to the shimmering, sapphire pool where tiny, blind crabs live. Tropical gardens, volcanic sculptures, an auditorium and a nightclub add to the appeal of this otherworldly attraction.  Stroll around Jardin de Cactus  Designed by Cesar Manrique, the Jardín de Cactus (Cactus Garden) is home to an astounding 1,420 species of cacti, which raise their spiky arms to the sky and punctuate the barren volcanic landscape. A restored windmill gives a window onto the surrounding landscape and there's a pretty café overlooking the thorny garden.  Take in the Timple Museum  At Casa Spinola in Teguise, there's a museum (http://casadeltimple.org) dedicated to the humble timple, a small guitar, a bit like a ukulele, that has been a traditional instrument on Lanzarote since the 18th century. The timple's greatest moment came in 2009 when musician Benito Cabrero performed a show with one at The Carnegie Hall.  Visit the former capital  The island's original capital, Teguise is an archetypal Lanzarote town. Uniform white, single storey cottages line narrow, bougainvillea draped alleyways, and tinkling fountains adorn cobbled plazas. Excellent artisan shops and good tapas bars abound. Join the hordes on Sunday mornings for Lanzarote's largest flea market; avoid Sundays if you'd prefer to experience the real Teguise – quiet and traditional.",europe,spain,canary islands
austria,"Despite its small size, Austria has a long-established international reputation, which is why most visitors arrive with heads full of Habsburg, Mozart and Alpine visions. Some expectations are delightfully met – the mountain scenery is breathtakingly real, there are the omnipresent fingerprints of the old empire in Vienna, and home-grown musical icons Mozart, Schubert and Strauss are championed everywhere – but Austria also has a few surprises up its sleeve in the form of contemporary art, cutting-edge architecture and innovative cuisine.      Austria is frequently cited as one of the best places to live in Europe, and it is not difficult to see why. Remarkably safe and clean, it offers plenty of affordable culture, natural beauty and elegant Baroque and neoclassical architecture, as well as an efficient public transport system.      It’s also surprisingly varied. You can hurtle down a black run in the skiing paradises of Kitzbühel and St Anton, or cosy up with a hot drink in one of Vienna’s famous coffee houses. You can skate across icy lakes in winter or seek out wildflower meadows on summertime hikes. You can wonder at the intricate church interiors and the ostentatious opulence of the old Habsburg palaces, or indulge in a more low-key aspect of Mitteleuropa culture over a steaming goulash in a rustic country inn. Or you can ride a horse through pretty wooded tracts, get an eyeful of Rubens, Raphael and Rembrandt, and marvel at Hundertwasser House in Vienna – a fantastical housing complex characterised by its vivid patterns and mismatched colours.      Don’t try to squeeze it all in though. More than anything, Austria is a place to recline, relax and relish. Its natural beauty is the result of many millennia of natural activity and its grand art, architecture and culture was painstakingly created by many hands over many centuries. These aren’t sights to be hurriedly ticked off a list; allow yourself plenty of time to luxuriate.","Austria  Attractions in Austria  Admire Austria's architectural beauty  Soak up Vienna's baroque elegance, notably in the First District (the Innere Stadt), and enjoy Salzburg’s splendid Altstadt (old city), which features the Hohensalzburg fortress, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Other sights in Salzburg include the Peterskirche (St Peter's Abbey, with cemetery and catacombs), the Domkirche (intended to rival St Peter's in Rome) and the Alter Markt (old market square).  Bathe in award-winning lakes  Take in the awesome panorama of some of Austria's beautiful lakes: they include Wörthersee, Wolfgangsee, Traunsee, Hallstättersee and Mondsee, one of the warmest lakes in the Salzkammergut region. Known as ""Austria's Riveria"", Carinthia's lakes reach temperatures of around 28°C (82°F) and are best for bathers having won several awards for their water quality.  Celebrate classical music at Salzburg festival  Listen to classical music in the city that produced Mozart. World renowned, the Salzburg Festival provides a varied programme, from singers, actors, orchestras and opera. Enjoy a concert at the House for Mozart or outside in Cathedral Square with its breath-taking baroque backdrop.  Discover the delights of Tyrol  Explore the Tyrol, Austria's most mountainous province, with forests, pastures, valleys, mountain lakes, alpine villages, churches and castles. Innsbruck, the region’s capital, has numerous historical buildings including a 12th-century castle. For spectacular views, take the funicular to Hungerburg and then the cable car to Hafelekar at 2,334m (5,928ft).  Enjoy the country's coolest sculptures  Witness the magical Eisriesenwelt in Werfen: ice caves, featuring wonderful ice sculptures all year round. These natural caverns are buried deep beneath the mountain wall that flanks the valley south of Salzburg and are accessible by cable car. As well as shimmering walls and impressive icicle displays, the caves offer uninterrupted vistas over the mountains.  Get to grips with Graz on foot  Explore Graz on foot. Must-sees include the Universalmuseum Joanneum encompassing the Alte Galerie's gothic paintings, the Neue Galerie in the Herberstein Palace, the Cathedral, the Mausoleum of Emperor Ferdinand II, the old quarter, the Schlossberg (Castle Hill) with its Uhrturm (clock tower), and the Glockenturm (bell tower).  Hike high and low in the Alps  Once the snow has melted, hike through the Alps' varied landscapes, ranging from forests and green slopes to glaciers and rocks. The Vorarlberg's alpine pastures provide gentle walks, while the Hohe Tauern National Park has more demanding trekking. For a long distance adventure, sweat the length of the Lech River – Holzgau suspension bridge has unforgettable views.  Hold your nerve at Harakiri, Austria’s steepest ski slope  The Alps are one of Europe's major winter sport destinations, and keen snow freaks can go skiing, snowboarding, tobogganing, sleigh riding, curling and skating across much of Austria. However, only the bravest should test their mettle at Mayrhofen, where the country's steepest ski slope, Harakiri, leans at a vertigo-including 78%.  Look good in leather at the Lederhosen Festival   Admire traditional Austrian attire at the annual Lederhosen Festival in Windischgarsten. With wood-chopping races, ceremonial dancing and accordion playing, the festival is a celebration of Austrian custom. Although the wearing of the aforementioned costume is optional, drinking good beer and cheering at the election of “Miss (or Mr) Lederhosen” is compulsory.  Paddle the Danube in the Donau-Auen National Park  One of the last major wetlands in Europe, this national park nurtures a diversity of plants and animals. A short drive from Vienna, the vast green space offers the perfect escape to the city with the winding Danube splitting the forest in two. Take a canoe downstream and enjoy the water up close.  Play 18 holes in the Austrian mountains  Play golf at more than 150 courses in what is one of Europe's fastest-growing golf destinations. Settings to test your swings sway from the grounds of historic castles to alpine valleys and terraces. Check your putting in standout settings such as Schloss Schonborn, known for its manor house 19th hole, and Golf Eichenheim in Kitzbuehel for views across the Kaiser Mountains.  Ride Austria's steepest steam railway  Take an old 19th-century steam train and gaze at some picturesque Austrian scenery. Starting at the famous and beautiful village of St Wolfgang in Salzkammergut, Austria’s steepest cogwheel rail pulls itself to the top of Schafberg Mountain. At 1,783m (5,850ft), riding the railway is preferable to making it up under your own steam.  Sample the best of Austria's vineyards  Take a tasting tour through one of Austria's wine-growing regions, such as Lower Austria or Southern Styria for their elegant Sauvignon blanc and the Burgenland. Most wines, such as the well-known Riesling wine, are white, but there also some good reds from Baden and Burgenland worthy of attention.  See the striking stallions of Austria  Watch the famous Lipizzaner stallions perform finely executed dressage manoeuvres in Vienna. Set to Viennese classical music, the performances are held at the splendid Hofburg Palace. The Spanish Riding School, named after the horses' heritage, is also in the capital, while in Piber, visitors can see the stud farm where they are looked after, trained and ridden.   Take to the lake for floating opera  Attend the Opera in style: besides the many opera performances in Austria's major towns and cities, journey to Bregenz for a show with a difference. The Upper City is home to St Martinsturm (St Martin's Tower) and the world's largest floating stage for summer opera productions.  Unwind with coffee and cake  Relax and watch the world go by as you submit to Austria's Kaffeehaus (coffee shop) culture: cakes and puddings (such as torte, of which there are around 60 varieties) can be eaten guilt-free, knowing that it is all in the name of upholding a national institution.  Visit the birthplace of Mozart  Pay homage to Salzburg's most famous son, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. His birthplace (Mozart Geburtshaus) is in the Getreidegasse, also the city's main shopping street and is now a dedicated museum. So too is his family home (Mozart Wohnhaus) on the market square, where concerts and lectures are held alongside a permanent exhibition.  Waltz the night away at the Johann Strauss Ball  Dance the hours away at a recreation of a traditional Austrian ball. Find out your most elegant black tie attire for the annual Johann Strauss Ball, which takes place in a beautiful ballroom in the Kursalon Vienna, one of Vienna’s most beautiful and historic buildings. Guests are welcomed with a waltz and served fine dining cuisine before finishing the evening with a midnight concert.",europe,,
nunavut,"Stark, but stunning, barren, yet crammed with wildlife: Nunavut is as wild and remote as it gets. If getting away from it all is your aim, you’ve come to the right place. You’re more likely to see a plodding polar bear or a bouncing beluga whale than another human being. Canada’s youngest territory makes up a fifth of Canada, but is home to less than 0.1% of its population.      You have to be pretty determined to get here though, as there are no roads either to Nunavut or between the territory’s communities. A platinum credit card and a wealthy benefactor can go a long way to funding the eye-wateringly expensive airfares.      But make it here and you’re rewarded with unfathomable wilderness and not a coach tour in sight. You can hike or ski among granite peaks, gigantic glaciers and mammoth fjords on Baffin Island. Or dodge herds of muskoxen and packs of Arctic wolves on Ellesmere Island, where a smattering of hardy flora makes a colourful splash on the otherwise barren scenery.      Pitch your tent on the open tundra beneath a sun that never sets or brave Nunavut’s frigid temperatures and spend a night in a winter igloo.      At the floe edge or sinaaq, a veritable Noah’s ark of Arctic wildlife gathers in the spring: polar bears, walruses, narwhals and beluga whales for starters. The northeastern coastline of Baffin Island is considered one of the world’s best places to spot a steady conveyor belt of 10,000-year-old icebergs drifting past.      As the ice breaks up, grab a kayak and explore the magnificent Arctic Archipelago shoreline, or canoe along an astonishing number of inland rivers and lakes. If the airfare home is too high, you always have your oars.","Nunavut  Attractions in Nunavut  Arctic animals  You can seek out musk ox or tundra swans near Cambridge Bay or take a boat trip to Coats Island in Hudson Bay to see walrus and polar bears. Nunavut's herd of 500,000 caribou is the world's largest. Many species roam the tundra in the Thelon Wildlife Sanctuary, which straddles the Kivalliq and Kitikmeot regions.  Art tours  Inuit art tours offer visitors an opportunity to learn about native carving, tool-fashioning, weaving, print-making, jewellery-crafting and hat-making.  Authentic tours  Nunavut's fauna, flora, culture and history come alive on one of the territory's nature and cultural tours.  Dog sleds and igloos  You can take a trip across the frozen tundra by dog sled with an Inuit guide in Iqaluit, or bed down for a night in a bona fide igloo.  Fishing  The catch of the day includes Arctic char and lake trout. Enthusiasts should note that catch-and-release is practised in all areas and that possession limits are based on regular and seasonal evaluation of stock.  Go with the floe  Wildlife is particularly abundant in spring (April to July) at the 'floe edge', where the land ice meets the sea. Plankton, shrimp and fish attract seals, whales and polar bears, making for excellent wildlife viewing. Bring your binoculars, as this is the time of year when migrating birds fly north by the millions. Good wildlife-spotting locations include Pond Inlet and Arctic Bay.  Hiking and rafting  Utter wilderness greets those who hike around amazing destinations such as Auyuittuq National Park's mountains, the waterfalls of Katannilik Territorial Park, wildlife-rich Quttinirpaaq National Park, or Sirmilik National Park (a haven for polar bears, walrus and migrating birds). If you have excellent white-water paddling skills, challenge yourself to the heart-stopping waters of the Coppermine River in Kugluk (Bloody Falls) Territorial Park.  Photography  Dramatic scenery and seasonal variations in light and temperature provide rewarding conditions for photography. One of the best times is during the sunlit nights (between 2000 and 0300 in spring and summer), when shadows are long and colours and textures particularly well defined.  Spring frolics  Not surprisingly, in a land where winters are long and harsh, spring is a traditional time for celebration. Cheer on snowmobile and dog sled racers, or join in a community supper, at the Taloyoak Spring Games in Taloyoak or the Toonik Tyme Festival in Iqaluit, among others.",north america,canada,
lebanon,"Fringed by golden beaches, peppered with World Heritage Sites and home to the Middle East's premier party city, Lebanon has all the hallmarks of a classic traveller's destination. Yet the reality, alas, is not quite so rosy. Still recovering from a brutal civil war (1975-1990), the conflict in neighbouring Syria is spilling across the border and the Bekaa Valley remains a stronghold for the militant group Hezbollah. Suffice to say, cautious tourists have stayed away.  Nevertheless, for now, a fragile peace prevails in Lebanon, which extends a warm welcome to foreign visitors. Nowhere is this clearer than in the capital, Beirut, a friendly party town sandwiched between the Mediterranean Sea and the foothills of Mount Lebanon. Characterised by its affable inhabitants, dramatic coastline and delicious cuisine, bustling Beirut sits at the crossroads between Europe and Arabia. Influences from east and west abound – it is not uncommon to hear the call to prayer competing with DJs in some of the livelier parts of town.  Although buildings still bear the scars of past conflicts, the city is a forward-thinking capital where the biggest danger nowadays seems to be the traffic – crossing the road can feel like an extreme sport. Though small in size, Lebanon boasts five UNESCO World Heritage Sites including the city of Byblos, one of the oldest Phoenician ports, and the haunting remains of Baalbeck in the Hezbollah-run Bekaa Valley, one of the finest examples of Greco-Roman architecture in existence.  Other highlights including the magnificent cedar forests and Christian monasteries of the Holy Valley, as well as the ancient cities of Tyr and Tripoli, home to one of the oldest seaports in the world. And if that's not enough, there's always skiing in Mount Lebanon. Granted, it might not be an obvious place to hit the slopes, but there are few places in this world that can offer sun, sand and skiing in one day. But then Lebanon is not your average destination.","Lebanon  Attractions in Lebanon  Al Mina  Enjoy delicious Lebanese food in the port area of Al Mina, where many seafood restaurants and fish markets can be found.  Al Shouf Cedar Nature Reserve  Lebanon's largest nature reserve is home to three large cedar forests, which combine to make up a quarter of the country's remaining cedar trees. As well as being home to an array of flora and fauna, the nature reserve is also criss-crossed with miles of hiking and biking trails.  American University of Beirut  See the neo-Ottoman campus of the American University of Beirut in Hamra, which was founded in 1868 (www.aub.edu.lb). It is also home to an archaeological museum housing an impressive collection of artefacts dating from the Stone Age to the Islamic periods.   Archaeological sites  Discover the archaeological sites of Tyre (http://tyros.leb.net/tyre). Area one contains ruins of the large district of civic buildings, public baths and mosaic streets, whilst area two has an extensive network of Romano-Byzantine roads. Area three contains one of the largest Roman hippodromes ever found.  Baalbeck  Set on the south western slopes of the Anti-Lebanon range in the Bekaa Valley, the spectacular ruins of Baalbeck are arguably one of the most impressive examples of surviving Phoenician and Greco-Roman architecture in the World. Its Temple of Jupiter is the largest Roman temple ever built.  Beirut beaches  With 225km (140 miles) of coastline, you are never far from a stretch of beach in Lebanon. Few cities can boast sandy beaches on their doorstep but the azure waters of the Mediterranean lap much of the city’s perimeters. There are public beaches or many sun worshippers favour the better-equipped beach clubs offering sun loungers, showers, pools and cafes and restaurants such as those offered at the Riviera Beach Lounge. (www.rivieirahotel.com.lb).  Beirut's Central District  Witness the spectacular number of modern buildings and office blocks springing up in Beirut's Central District.  Beiteddine  Set on a height in the heart of the Chouf Mountains and commanding fabulous views of the surrounding landscape is the magnificent fortress of Beiteddine. Built over a 30-year period by the Ottoman ruler Emir Bechir Chehab II, it is one of the finest examples of 19th century Lebanese palace architecture in the country. The interior features some previous mosaics as well as Turkish baths, hammams, courtyards, elegant arcades and gardens as well as an ethnological museum.  Byblos  The charming Unesco World Heritage listed fortified seaside town of Byblos lies 40km north of Beirut (http://whc.unesco.org). Excavations have unearthed artefacts dating back to Neolithic times but Byblos’ golden period came during the reign of the Phoenicians, when it was a crucial crossroad between the east and west. Its picturesque, boat cluttered harbour and pretty honey coloured fortifications also enjoyed great popularity as a glamorous seaside retreat during the 1960s when it was visited by the likes of Brigitte Bardot.  Downtown Beirut  Scattered with some of Beirut's most elegant Art Deco architectural heritage much of downtown Beirut has been undergoing an expensive refurbishment since the civil war. Lined with arcades and sidewalk cafes, the spiritual heart of this pedestrianised area is the Place de L'Etoile topped by a 1930s clock tower. Nearby is the Lebanese parliament - another fine example of a Lebanese art deco style building - while the area is also home to several important churches and mosques.  Gibran Museum  Visit the Gibran Museum in Besharre (www.kahlil.org/museum). Best known as the birthplace of the famous Lebanese poet Khalil Gibran, author of The Prophet, the town is also a gateway to the Kadisha Valley, a mountainous region famous for its many cedar trees.  Jeita caverns  Visit the spectacular Jeita Grotto, around 20km (13 miles) north of Beirut. On two levels, the deep, upper cavern is reached by cable car and features a dazzling display of stalactites and stalagmites, which can be viewed along a special walkway. A small tourist train collects visitors at the entrance and takes them to the lower cave, which includes an underground lake that can be admired during a short boat ride.  Palm Islands  A short distance off the coast, 5.5km (3 miles) from the seaside city of Tripoli, is the Palm Islands Nature Reserve, a trio of uninhabited islands and the country's only true islands. Wildlife enthusiasts can observe the islands' colony of protected Loggerhead turtles as well as large colonies of migratory birds.  Pigeon Rocks  One of Beirut's most iconic landmarks are the Pigeon Rocks, an impressive collection of arched rock formations jutting out of the Mediterranean close to the Raouche district of the city on the westerly end of the Corniche. From the pavement lined with restaurants and cafes, there is a 100m pathway that leads down to the sea and affords spectacular views.  Scuba-diving  Go scuba-diving and snorkelling in the waters near the ancient city of Tyre. Divers can explore some interesting underwater archaelogical ruins.  Sea castle  Glimpse the sea castle built of stone from Roman remains in the small port city of Sidon. See one of the best-preserved temple areas of the Roman world that is still in existence in Baalbek, near the Syrian border. The columns of the Temple of Jupiter soar behind the complex of several temples.  Ski  Ski amidst a Mediterranean backdrop in Lebanon's many mountain resorts, such as Bakish, The Cedars, Faqra, Faraya, Laklouk and Zarour, which offer excellent accommodation and facilities (www.skileb.com). Whilst there, explore these mountains and gorges. They present excellent terrain for hiking.  Souks  Capture the old Beirut in the city's old souks (covered markets) that are being reconstructed in an authentic way. Visit the weekly Souk El Tayab farmers market held in the downtown area of the city. Held every Saturday morning, this features an array of producers selling delicious organically produced fare from around the city and countryside including the likes of cedar honey, jams, pickles, fruit and vegetables as well as homemade olive oil (www.souktayeb.com). The Turkish bath at Al-Nouzha provides another glimpse of antiquity, whilst the Beirut National Museum is constantly updating its interesting collection (www.beirutnationalmuseum.com).  Teleferique cable car  Set on the outskirts of Beirut, this cable car was first opened in 1965 and spirits visitors up 650m (2,133 ft) above sea level and offers breathtaking views of the city and beyond  (www.teleferiquelb.com).  Tripoli  Lebanon's second and most Arabian city. Its old medieval centre at the foot of the Crusader castle is sprinkled with many mosques that include the Al-Muallaq Burtasiyat Madrassa, Al-Qartâwiyat Madrassa, Great Mosque and Taynâl. Its bustling souks are also some of the most atmospheric in the whole of the country and an obligatory stop on any visit to the city.  Turtles  Spot the green turtles and rare birds on the Island of Palm Trees, listed by UNESCO as a nature reserve, just off Tripoli.  Tyre  Another of Lebanon's unmissable archaeological sites that also enjoying Unesco World Heritage status is the seaside settlement of Tyre, which is scattered with the remnants of over 5,000 years of history. Settled by the Egyptians, Ottomans, Phoenicians, Greeks, Byzantines, Arabs and Romans, it is actually three sites covering a large area, but is perhaps best known for its ancient Roman relics that include one of the largest Roman hippodromes every constructed.  Vineyards of the Bekaa Valley  Lebanon has one of the oldest traditions of viticulture in the world. The Phoenicians first introduced wine to the area around 5,000 years ago and the vine-draped slopes of the Bekaa Valley form the heart of Lebanese wine production. Pay a visit to historic vineyards such as the Chateau Musar set in an 18th century castle and Chateau Ksara, two of the country's best-known producers.  Watersports  Try out the watersports on offer, which include waterskiing and sailing. Swimming is also popular and many beaches have freshwater pools provided to supplement the sea.",middle east,,
vietnam,"Some destinations evoke mental images the moment their names are mentioned, and Vietnam is one of them. A frenetic and fascinating country, it calls to mind conical-hatted street vendors, water buffalo plodding across rice fields, mopeds buzzing through cities and floating markets on the Mekong River.      The days when Vietnam was best known for its conflict with America are long gone. From the temples of Hanoi and the islands of Halong Bay to the beaches of Nha Trang and the palaces of Hue, it is a country now firmly etched in the travel psyche.      At times, Vietnam is an assault on the senses. Life in its feverish cities is conducted largely on the streets, among chattering bia hois (pavement pubs) and steaming pho (noodle soup) stands. The country’s two main cities – Hanoi in the north, Ho Chi Minh in the south – are different in many ways, but they share an intoxicating energy. Ancient pagodas and colonial houses jostle for space with new-build skyscrapers, while labyrinthine back-alleys hum with life. These narrow streets are atmospheric places to spend time, day or night.      The country’s long, thin shape, sometimes compared to two rice baskets at either end of a pole, means these two cities form natural start and end points to an itinerary. The highlights along the way, meanwhile, are as well packed as the spring rolls which adorn market stalls: nature-lovers, history buffs, beach bums and foodies are all catered for in singularly Vietnamese style.      Those heading into the countryside can expect not only glorious scenery, but a rich cultural web of different ethnic groups. The US wartime legacy can still be readily explored – perhaps most notably at the Cu Chi Tunnels near Ho Chi Minh – but this is a country to enjoy for what it is today, whether you’re here for a few days or a month.","Vietnam  Attractions in Vietnam  Cruise Halong Bay  Sure it's touristy, and if you take a boat trip you'll be among a flotilla of dozens of old converted junks, but Halong Bay still remains one of the most impressive natural sights in Southeast Asia, its limestone kart islands jutting dramatically from the sea. Overnight trips are available.  Enjoy Ho Chi Minh City  Gleaming skyscrapers sit side by side with ramshackle buildings and crumbling colonial houses. Monks pass deluxe car showrooms collecting alms. Sun-baked streets heave with honking motorbikes as the Saigon River thrums with small boats and ferries. Our advice? Give yourself plenty of time to take it all in.  Escape the heat in Dalat  To escape the heat of the plains, head for Dalat, a former colonial hill station, reminiscent of a French town. Its faded, elegant villas are evocative of another era. Colonists from Saigon headed to its cool climes, as did the emperor and his entourage. The romantic lakes and alpine scenery are magnets for Vietnamese honeymooners.  Explore the Central Highlands  Dalat is as far as most people go into the Central Highlands but if you head further into the mountains you'll find gorgeous, waterfall-laced hillscapes. The area around Buon Ma Thuot, a coffee-growing region, is a good option – and serves as a reminder that Vietnam is the world's second-largest coffee producer.  Get a suit made in Hoi An  Meander the narrow streets of Hoi An, where tiny shop-houses sit cheek by jowl with riverside bars. It's an obvious place to buy souvenirs – silk items, T-shirts and ceramics are all commonplace – but the headline draw is the chance to have bespoke clothing made by one of the many tailors.  Go hiking  There are hundreds of long distance hiking trails around the country, and a significant infrastructure for visitors wanting guided trekking tours. A strong option? Head south from Hanoi into Cuc Phuong National Park, a wilderness of forest-covered limestone mountains rising up from green rice paddies. It's also home to many rare species and a primate rescue centre.  Learn more about the Vietnam War  It's now more than 40 years since the Vietnam War (known locally as the American War) finished, but is legacy remains tangible. Visitors can tour the DMZ (Demilitarised Zone), walk parts of the one-time supply route known as the Ho Chi Minh Trail, and see tunnels – most notably those at Cu Chi – used in the conflict.  Learn to cook  The food in Vietnam can be astonishingly good. Learn the subtleties of the national cuisine by joining a cookery class – you'll be submerged into the melee of a local market to buy provisions before retreating to a kitchen to prepare (and, naturally, taste) a few dishes. Hoi An and Ho Chi Minh are both good spots to try.  Lose yourself in Hanoi  Hanoi is a hyperactive, sense-spinning whirl of a city, particularly in the maze of narrow lanes and street kitchens in and around the Old Quarter.  Elsewhere, wide, leafy boulevards are lined by colonial buildings in the French quarter. Wherever you are, the background noise is the buzzing of the motorbikes that crowd the capital.  Sail the Mekong Delta  Explore the watery world of the Mekong Delta, where the channels of the mighty Mekong crisscross the land past shimmering emerald paddy fields and sugar cane plantations. Discover riverine towns and floating markets, or try spending the night in a waterside homestay.  See Sapa’s rice terraces  In the very north of the country, the one-time French hill station of Sapa is surrounded by hefty alpine scenery, its hills carpeted in spectacular rice terraces. It's also a good place to learn more about some of the hill tribes that still live in the area, most notably the Hmong. Hiking is popular, and village homestays can be arranged.  See the country on two wheels  Motorbike hire is easily arranged in various parts of the country. The vehicles are most commonly Russian-made 125cc Minsks – some travellers even ride the full distance between Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City. Riddled with all sorts of dangers, not least the vast amount of bikes in the cities, it is nevertheless an exhilarating way to see the country.  Taste history in Hué  The former imperial city of Hue is crammed with wonderful sights. The imposing Imperial Citadel, weathered by the ravages of war and the tropical weather, is slowly being painstakingly renovated. Down at the riverside, meanwhile, you'll find the Thien Mu pagoda, where novice monks peek shyly at the visitors, and the mausoleums of the Emperors, each unique in style.  Travel on the Reunification Express  The rail lines of the so-called Reunification Express run virtually the length of the country, from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh. 'Express' is a misnomer, however. It can take between 30 and 40 hours to travel between the two cities, so it's advisable to do one section only. Popular is the 18-hour journey between Hanoi and Hue.  Unwind on the beach  The beaches of Vietnam are superb. Nha Trang is the perfect combination of wide, palm-lined sands and lively, bar-lined town – boat trips can take you out to nearby islands and coral reefs. Alternatively, Vung Tau offers superb snorkelling, while Mui Ne is where to head for surfing and adrenaline thrills.  Visit the Cao Dai Temple  Head out to Tay Ninh to view the colourful midday service of the intriguing Cao Dai sect, held in a large temple almost Disney-esque in style. The followers wear red, blue and yellow robes and chant to the accompaniment of a traditional orchestra. The religion combines various beliefs – its saints include Joan of Arc, Buddha, Christ, Muhammad and Victor Hugo.",asia,,
vermont,"Big-city life takes a backseat in the ‘Green Mountain State,’ which certainly lives up to its nickname. But it’s not all verdant peaks: Vermont boasts shimmering lakes, scenic road trips and action aplenty.      Yes, it’s the only New England state without a coastline, but Lake Champlain certainly makes up for it. On its shore sits Burlington, Vermont’s largest city, which is more of a town really. It’s one of those places everyone wants to move to, humming with creative entrepreneurs who take their dogs to work and clock off early to kayak, bike or catch the last chairlift.      Part of the fun of Vermont is hitting the road and seeing where you end up. The state is famous for its vivid autumn foliage, white clapboard villages and rickety wooden bridges. Alternatively, leave the car behind and hike a section of the Appalachian Trail or trek the 438km (272mile) Long Trail, the USA's oldest long-distance hiking trail, which links Massachusetts with the Canadian border.

moldova,"Moldova is a largely overlooked destination, as yet untouched by the budget airline brigade. But it shouldn't be. In this land-locked Eastern European country, you can wander round vast monasteries, trek through ancient forests, or sample the local wines. Rich with history and fertile soils that produce abundant vineyards, Moldova is a special country despite its lack of fame, and one well worth getting to know.  Despite remaining one of the poorest countries in Europe, the people are friendly and welcoming, and the main hubs, such as the capital Chişinău, have everything a visitor could need. Although few outsiders have heard about it as a viable city break destination, Chişinău has plenty going on. There's a buzzing cafe-bar and restaurant scene, while its cathedrals, monuments and museums have survived despite the city taking a serious pounding from aerial bombardments during World War II. One such survivor not to miss is the house where the writer Pushkin spent his days in exile penning some of his most famous works.  The most obvious selling point of Moldova is probably that it's almost the least known spot in Europe. With only a few thousand visiting the country in every year – even neighbouring Romania and Ukraine see far higher foreign footfall – it's mainly favoured by intrepid backpacking completists. But there's much more to the country than this.  A largely unspoilt, natural hinterland with plenty in the way of traditional culture and village life still going, Moldova can feel like a fragment of old Europe, at least if you get beyond the cities. Cross the Dniestr River, and you'll find yourself in the beguiling separatist Russian-speaking province of Transdniestr, all Soviet architecture and Lenin busts.  Then there's the wine. The Moldovan grape's slowly fermenting fame means that the wine tourism industry is just beginning to emerge. The upshot? You can try one of Europe's best, most unique wines in a hidden land that will surely have more than its fair of tourists in the years to come.","Moldova  Attractions in Moldova  Chekhov Drama Theatre  Watch a performance at the former Chisinau Choral Synagogue that today houses the Chekhov Drama Theatre.  Chisinau  Explore the Moldovan capital of Chisinau (formerly Kishinev), which stands on the banks of the small River Byk.

Chisinau Lake  Swim at the man-made Chisinau Lake with picturesque bathing beaches, and boats for hire.  Chisinau cemeteries  Pay respects at the two old cemeteries in Chisinau, the Armenian Cemetery and the Jewish Cemetery. The latter is famous as the burial place for the victims of the Chisinau Pogrom in 1903.  Emil Racovita  Named after the eminent 19th century Romanian biologist Emil Racovita, the cave complex in the village of Criva in Moldova is one of the biggest in the world. A network of underground galleries stretches over 89,000m (291,991 ft) and is split across several levels. Discovered in 1959, the cave is the third largest gypsum cave in the world and parts of the complex are only accessible via large wells. The huge caves have been given names such as Cinderella's Hall and Dacia's Hall reflecting their size and grandeur and there are also several underground lakes including the Blue Lake and the Dinosaur Lake. There are no trail markers but visitors are able to explore the caves in small groups with an experienced guide.  Explore forests  Spot indigenous flora and fauna in the country's forests, such as the Stanca-Jeloboc forest.

united arab emirates,"Comprised of little more than sand dunes, crumbling forts and fishing villages a century ago, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has grown into a show-stopping, headline-grabbing destination which offers an intriguing blend of traditional Islamic culture and rampant consumerism.       Powered largely (but by no means exclusively) by oil wealth, the UAE today is defined by opulent resort hotels, ultra-modern architecture and a seemingly unending thirst for new and innovative mega-projects. Manmade islands in the shape of palm trees? Tick. Billionaire royals taking over Premiership football clubs? Tick. Tallest building on the planet? Naturally.      Seven separate emirates make up the country, but visitor attention falls mainly on Dubai and Abu Dhabi. Both are home to an ever-growing spread of luxury accommodation, gourmet restaurants, branded nightclubs and gleaming shopping malls. Dubai’s most iconic sights include the sail-shaped “7-star” hotel Burj Al Arab, the Burj Khalifa skyscraper and the sea-themed Atlantis Resort, which are microcosms of the UAE’s lofty ambitions.      The regular fountain show in the Downtown area rivals that of the Bellagio in Las Vegas, while vast shopping complexes like Dubai Mall (complete with one of the world’s largest aquariums) and Mall of the Emirates (complete with ski slope) are packed with premium international labels.      Abu Dhabi, meanwhile, doesn’t have quite the same verve but boasts some remarkable attractions, from the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque to the Ferrari World theme park. And in both destinations, there’s the option to delve into the UAE’s blend of Islamic culture and modernity, from spice souks to falcon hospitals. Meanwhile, the vast natural desert offers endless discoveries via exciting modes of transport from hot air balloon and quad bike to helicopter or sandboard.      And don’t be dazzled by Abu Dhabi and Dubai alone – the other emirates are also worthy of exploration. Among them, coastal Fujairah offers nature walks and a host of outdoor adventures, including mountain biking and scuba diving, while Ras al-Khamiah has excellent off-road driving and hiking in the rugged Hajar Mountains.","United Arab Emirates  Attractions in United Arab Emirates  Abu Dhabi's islands  The eight natural islands off the coast of Abu Dhabi include the spectacular Sir Bani Yas, home to the swanky Anantara Desert Islands Resort & Spa and around 30 free roaming Arabian and African animal species.  Al-Ain  Head east through spectacular scenery from Abu Dhabi or Dubai to the resort and former caravan stop of Al-Ain. The resort includes a camel market, zoo and museum containing old and new artefacts and Mesopotamian pottery. The lush oasis village also offers excellent hiking at nearby Jebel Hafeet.  Ancient Hatta  The ancient fortressed villages of Hatta and Wadi Hatta are close to Dubai, in a surprisingly lush and attractive valley in the foothills of the Hajar Mountains. The area also has a number of naturally formed pools to cool off in.  Archaeological sites  Explore the important archaeological digs at Hili, 10km (6 miles) from Al Ain. The stone tombs, including the famous Great Sepulchre, date back 5,000 years. Al-Ain also includes a camel market, zoo and museum containing old and new artefacts and Mesopotamian pottery. There's also offers excellent hiking at nearby Jebel Hafeet.  Bastakiya, Dubai  The historic Bastakiya alongside Dubai Creek is Dubai's Bohemian quarter, with some wonderful cafés, and eclectic art galleries. It's particularly pleasant during the evening when the mosques sound their call to prayer.  Beaches  The beaches offer white sand and warm, clear waters but in Dubai, Fujairah and Abu Dhabi, the best are to be found at luxury hotels. You can pay a few dirhams to visit beaches with toilet facilities, such as Jumeirah Beach Park, Dubai, and Sandy Beach, Fujairah (for incredible snorkelling opportunities). Excellent beaches include JBR Beach, Jumeirah Open Beach (a favourite for surfers), and Kite Beach (a favourite for kite-surfers). Topless bathing is not permitted anywhere, but women are free to wear bikinis at the beach.  Deep-sea fishing  The waters of the Gulf are excellent fishing grounds. Fully-equipped boats with crew can be hired for deep-sea fishing trips from all marinas, via hotels and local tour companies.  Desert driving  Off-road driving in the desert is excellent for thrillseekers. Vehicles are available for hire either with or without guides at nearly every hotel. Adventurous travellers can view the dunes by air, in a hot air balloon.         Dhow cruise  Take a traditional dhow cruise from the Abu Dhabi or Dubai Creek marina, or book a fully-equipped boat for deep-sea fishing trips. Alternatively, catch a traditional spluttering abra (small boat) along Dubai Creek for only a few dirhams each way. Yacht trips are also available from the Dubai Marine Yacht Club.  Dubai World Cup horse race  Go to the races at the annual Dubai World Cup (www.dubaiworldcup.com), or learn more about the Arabs' passion for horses at the Abu Dhabi Equestrian Club (www.adec-web.com) close to the UAE's capital.  First-class golf courses  Dubai is unequivocally one of the world's top golfing destinations. Venues like the Emirates Golf Club (www.dubaigolf.com) regularly host top international competitions, and there are scores of others dotted around the UAE, though the bulk and the best are in Dubai. You can even try your hand at sand golf.  Iconic buildings  At more than 828m (2,716.5ft), Dubai’s Burj Khalifa (www.burjkhalifa.ae) is the tallest building in the world and if you reserve ahead you can visit the observation deck on Level 124. Tours of the sail-shaped Burj al-Arab or Abu Dhabi’s sprawling Emirates Palace hotel (reportedly the most expensive in the world) can also be arranged.  Mosques and forts  Don't miss the many historic mosques and forts dotted around the older parts of Abu Dhabi and Dubai, notably the incredible Sheikh Zayed Mosque in Abu Dhabi and Jumeirah Mosque in Dubai. Non-Muslims are welcome to enter during certain visiting times, however women must cover their hair and body. Sheilas (head scarf) and abayas (traditional black dress for women) are available to borrow.  Palm Jumeirah  Dubai's manmade palm-shaped island is rumoured to be visible from the moon, and it truly does have a wow-factor – especially when seen flying low over the city. The built up areas consist of residential and hotel projects including the awesome Atlantis The Palm, home to Aquaventure water park – an absolute must for a hilariously wet, fun day out.  Ras al-Khaimah  Outdoor lovers will enjoy Ras al-Khaimah (www.rasalkhaimah.ae), which has coastline, the rugged Hajar Mountains and Khatt mineral springs.  Remote beaches  Aside from the main cities, there are remote stretches of coastline to be found dotted around the country – one of the most peaceful parts include the harbour at Dibba (around 90 minutes from Dubai) and Khor Kalba, where you can kayak through mangroves. Umm-al Quwain also has some beautiful beaches with small, coastal hotels offering boat trips and crab-hunting.  Souk shopping  Go haggling in Dubai's famous souks, magnets for those in search of gold and jewellery bargains, and also for photographers or those who just want to experience the sights, smells and hubbub.  Wadis and Mountains  Wadis are dried out river beds and Emiratis love to explore them in four-wheel drive cars, a past time known as wadi bashing. The best areas are in Hatta and Jebel Hafeet mountain in Al Ain, or head for the hills in Ras al-Khaimah.",middle east,,
cape verde,"The islands of Cape Verde are a bewitching blend of Portuguese and African influences. You'll see it in the many European-style buildings and the curious musical styles, but its particularly noticeable in the food. Portuguese fare – especially seafood dishes laden with garlic and olive oil – and more African-style fare – such as stews, beans, maize and tropical crops – comfortably combined on most menus.      Many associate Cape Verde with the mournful songs of Cesaria Evoria, the islands' best known singer. The ‘barefoot diva' is the best exponent of morna, a lovelorn type of folk music similar to Portuguese fado. Music is a key component of life on Cape Verde, and several of the islands stage exuberant carnivals, with the best known being the Baia das Gatas Festival. São Vicente is also renowned for its exuberant festivities.      Once a colony and slave trade outpost, Cape Verde varies wildly in character and scenery through its 10 islands and five tiny islets. From spectacular verdant mountain ranges, to deserted beaches, with a few volcanic landscapes thrown in for good measure, it's the variety that makes Cape Verde such an unusual and appealing destination.      There’s lush and lively Santiago, the biggest of the islands, which boasts verdant hillsides, jungle and plenty of remarkable wildlife. It’s also the cultural heart of Cape Verde, home to the UNESCO-listed old fort at Cidade da Ribeira Grande de Santiagog (previously called Cidade Velha).      Near Santiago, divers will discover 16th century shipwrecks littering the sea floor. Blue marlin, yellowfin tuna and the odd humpback whale can be seen in the clear blue waters off Boa Vista. The island of Sal is popular for watersports and white sandy beaches, while Fogo is a hiker’s paradise, where volcanic peaks tower 2,829m (9,821 ft) above sea-level.      Cape Verde may have struggled economically since gaining independence from Portugal in 1975, but many argue that it's isolation is a blessing, leaving these islands comparatively unspoiled. The economy is currently stable and investing in modernized infrastructure, service, commerce, foreign investment and tourism. Get there before the crowds inevitably catch on.","Cape Verde  Attractions in Cape Verde  Bird-watching  Cape Verde’s islands are home to several rare breeds of African birds like sparrows, swifts and warblers. The islands are excellent spots to see Western Palearctic seabird colonies and land bird fauna. Many species of birds endemic to Cape Verde are endangered, but increased interest from wildlife-lovers promoting conservation may help reverse this trend.  Boa Vista: shop in Sal Rei  Beyond Boa Vista's golden beaches and date-tree lined coasts sits Sal Rei, the island's capital. Experience Sal Rei's swimming bays and boatyards, colonial-style churches and royal salt, then stop at the city's shopping square, Praça de Santa Isabel, for fresh produce and souvenirs like African batik cloth and carved wooden figures.   Fogo: ogle at the volcano  The fiery island of Fogo’s beautiful volcanic peak, Pico de Fogo, is visible from craters in the west. Most hotels and guesthouses are in the island’s largest city, São Felipe, which has approximately 20,000 residents. Shop in the busy marketplace, weave through colorful houses and Portuguese-influenced sobrado buildings, and taxi to the craters from there. Pico de Fogo’s influence rules the island, home to black sand beaches and houses built from lava rocks.  Sal: soak up the sun and surf  Sal’s white sandy beaches and evaporated salt deposits make it an adventurer’s paradise. Float in a natural salt lake in the salt mines, which were originally built in a dormant volcano. For more extreme sports, Kite Beach is perfect for wind and kitesurfing. Sal is also famous for its scuba dives, which have everything from shipwrecks and stingrays to reefs and overhangs. Santa Maria’s beach town on the island’s southernmost tip also has bars and restaurants where you can finish the day just in time to catch incredible sunsets on the shoreline.  Santiago: visit World Heritage Sites  Home to more than half of Cape Verde's population, Santiago is diverse in landscape and activity. Cidade Velha, a World Heritage site of ruins from first European settlement in the tropics, is a must-see for its cliff-side views of the sparkling Atlantic. Summer in Santiago is also a hot time for music and cultural pride with the lively Gamboa festival in May and Tabanka In June.   Santo Antão: eat and drink like a local  Get a taste for Cape Verde from Mercado Municipal in Ribeira Grande or one of Santo Antão’s coconut palms. The island’s landscapes vary from lush vegetation to colorful city squares, and a car ride is the best way to see it all. Blend in with the locals and sample Cape Verdean rum, grogue, produced on Santo Antão.  Sao Vicente: dance the night away  Dance to live music in the cultural melting pot of Cape Verde. Mindelo Harbor drew sailors from across the globe to this city, paving the way for sultry Cape Verdean morna folk music and upbeat coladeira. For a taster, try Cesaria Evora, a national icon. Sao Vicente’s annual Baia de Gata festival also attracts thousands of attendees each year.",africa,,
cuba,"With pristine beaches, lush forests and vibrant cities all waiting to be explored, Cuba is more than a generic Caribbean island getaway.      Cuba's capital, Havana, appears to be in a constant state of restoration, rather similar to the varying conditions of classic cars that roam its streets. Visitors can expect a mishmash of beautifully restored colonial buildings rubbing shoulders with dilapidated tenements of regular Cubans. The contrasts can be stark, but Havana's ubiquitous salsa rhythms and potent cocktails galvanise the city and make for an enthralling urban experience unlike any other.      Cuba's other cities are experiences in themselves too. Santiago de Cuba is a veritable melting pot of Afro-Caribbean cultures, where pastel covered buildings meet grand cathedrals. And then there's Trinidad, which offers a snapshot of a bygone era with its cobblestone streets and faded colonial façades.      Although the cities are delightful, for many visitors the greatest allure of Cuba is its beaches. Christopher Columbus described the sandy coast of Guardalavaca as ""the most beautiful land that human eyes have ever seen,"" and you can see why he was so taken – the impossibly white sands and warm turquoise waters are exquisite.      Adventurers may prefer to head inland to hike, bike and explore the limestone caves of Viñales. Viñales is said to have been Fidel Castro's favourite place in Cuba and it is where the country's famous tobacco is cultivated.      As Cuba slowly opens up to the rest of the world, modern resorts have become increasingly common, but the most rewarding stays are in casa particulares. These private homestays offer a true insight into everyday Cuban life, which you won't get in a hotel.      While Cuba is still not an easy country to get your head around, its affable climate, captivating history, beautiful beaches and swinging salsa rhythms certainly reward those who visit and give it the time it deserves.","Cuba  Attractions in Cuba  Bahía de Cochinos (Bay of Pigs) and Playa Girón  In 1961, the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion put this small inlet in the media spotlight. For more than 72 hours, some 1,500 Cuban exiles landed here and fought with the new Cuban government but lost. Today, a small museum in Playa Girón charts the conflicts. Beyond a history lesson, Playa Girón’s warm waters offer much for scuba divers.  Baracoa  Baracoa is a port city situated in the eastern part of Cuba. It was here that Christopher Columbus stopped in December 1492 and later, Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar established the island's first Spanish settlement in 1512. From 1518 to 1522, Baracoa was Cuba's capital, but its remote location soon made the conquistador looked elsewhere. Today, plantations surround the quaint city, and donkey carts roam the streets. As it remains so unspoiled, many consider it to be Cuba's best-kept secret.  Cayo Largo del Sur  A small resort island off Cuba's southern coast, Cayo Largo (Long Cay) is for those in search of shimmering sea fringed by long, sandy beaches in a tropical paradise. Accessible only by plane or helicopter, Cayo Largo has only a few hotels and villas. The best beaches are Playa Sirena and Playa Paraiso. There is also a Sea Turtle Rescue Center, along with a small museum on the island.  Havana, Hemingway's footsteps  Follow in Hemingway's footsteps with a visit to Hotel Ambos Mundos – in room 511 he began to write For Whom the Bell Tolls. Not far from the hotel you will find La Bodeguita del Medio – a bar that hosted many writers, including Hemingway. If you walk 10 minutes west of the hotel, you will find the self-proclaimed 'cradle of the daiquiri' El Floridita, another bar that Hemingway frequented. About 13km (8 miles) inland, you will find Finca Vigía, once the residence of Ernest Hemingway and now a museum.  Havana, La Habana Vieja (Old Havana)  Havana, Cuba's capital, is positively pulsating with colour and life. The UNESCO World Heritage-listed Habana Vieja (Old Havana) is an excellent place to start the tour of Havana. Narrow, cobbled streets lead to beautiful colonial architecture, some have been lovingly restored and brightly painted, but others still look as if they are about to collapse at any second. La Habana Vieja is best explored on foot.  Havana, Malecón  The seafront walk Malecón stretches almost the length of Havana. Here, old and young fish during the day and courting couples socialise at night. The Malecón also provides a wonderful view of Havana's cityscape.  Havana, Museo de la Revolución  Visit the Museo de la Revolución, located in the former presidential palace in Old Havana, to better understand the historical context of modern Cuba. Behind the museum, you will see a giant glass box containing the Granma, the yacht that transported 82 revolutionists (including Fidel Castro, Raúl Castro and Che Guevara) from Mexico to Cuba in November 1956.  Hiking in Cuba  The lush mountains, steep valleys, and sweeping plains of Cuba are made for hikers. Some of the best hikes include the Sierra Maestra, the mountain range in southeastern Cuba. Pico Turquino, Cuba's highest peak, is also in the Sierra Maestra mountain range, and you can conquer this mountain with a three-day trek. Soroa, 83km (52 miles) southwest of Havana, also offers delightful hiking and bird-watching experiences.  Isla de la Juventud  Once a supply base for pirates for about 300 years, Isla de la Juventud is said to be the inspiration for Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson. The waters surrounding the island are great diving spots. You can fly from Havana to Isla de la Juventud, or you can take a ferry from Batabanó, which is about 71km (44 miles) south of Havana.  Santiago de Cuba  The second-largest city in Cuba, Santiago de Cuba is widely regarded as the country's cultural capital. Worthy diversions include the 17th-century fortress Castillo San Pedro de la Roca, Moncada Museum and the Santa Ifigenia Cemetery where many famous Cubans are buried. It pays to coincide your trip with the Carnival of Santiago de Cuba, held at the end of July.  Trinidad  Experience Cuba's rich history in the UNESCO-listed Trinidad. Plaza Mayor is the beating heart of the city, surrounded by many attractions, including Palacio Cantero (a 19th-century mansion that has been converted to a municipal history museum) and the National Museum of the Struggle Against Bandits (the fight against the America-sponsored counterrevolutionaries). At night, a section of Plaza Mayor is turned into a music venue with musicians and dancers performing for the crowds. This is often referred to as Casa de la Música.",caribbean,,
argentina,"Spirited Argentina, with its clamouring capital, vast pampas, rolling wine regions and snowy peaks, is a land bursting with adventure. It’s a place where the clichés hold true: football is essentially a religion, the beef is phenomenal and there’s little point even thinking about starting a proper night out before midnight. Its natural wonders range from Andean plateaux and Patagonian glaciers to subtropical waterfalls and wildlife-rich wetlands. There’s an awful lot to love.      Buenos Aires might sit at the very edge of the country, gazing out across the Rio de la Plata, but it’s very much Argentina’s centrepiece. The city of Evita and Maradona, its tango halls, parillas (grill restaurants) and feisty porteños (BA residents) provide a gutsy introduction to the country. In the high-end neighbourhoods of Recoleta and Palermo you’ll find designer boutiques and trendy eateries, while historic San Telmo offers antique stalls, old-world cafés and an abundance of live music.      In the north, scorched mountains and otherworldly rock formations characterise the Salta region, where Spanish and Gaucho traditions combine and Argentina’s famous white wines flourish. Further west, in the Mendoza region, the grapes are red and the foothills of the Andes offer skiing, while down south, in Patagonia, you’ll find an astonishing spread of expansive lakes, jagged peaks and mile upon empty mile of open space.      Elsewhere, try walking in the glistening Lake District, whale-watching off the coast at Puerto Madryn, meeting baby penguins in Punta Tombo or exploring the Jesuit chapels and farmhouses of Córdoba. Another of the country’s majestic natural beauties is the mighty Iguazu Falls, bordering Argentina and Brazil.       Despite living through a dark military dictatorship and a spectacularly devastating economic crisis, Argentineans still have a vivacious and infectious lust for life. And from its subtropical top to its icy tip, it remains a mesmerising country.","Argentina  Attractions in Argentina  Discover vibrant La Boca  Marvel at the rainbow of painted houses and artistic talents of La Boca – a colourful portside neighbourhood in southern Buenos Aires. One of the area's star attractions is Boca Juniors' home ground, best known as La Bombonera (the chocolate box). This football ground is a fun place to visit by day, but it gets rowdy at night, especially after a match.  Feast on a meaty parilla  The traditional Argentine parrilla (grill) is the heart and soul of its national cuisine: sample morcilla (blood sausage), chinchulines (intestines) or simply plump for a slap of prime Argentine beef. For a reliably delicious meat experience Buenos Aires has many famous parrilla restaurants or try an open-air barbecue in the Pampas, for an authentic meat feast.  Go wild in the Lake District  With glacial lakes, towering mountains and dense forests, Argentina's Lake District is certainly one of the country's star attractions. It's the ideal destination if you're looking for tranquil wilderness, and for adrenaline-filled activities, from kayaking to rock climbing and more. Continue on to Lanín National Park, dominated by the extinct, snow-capped Lanín Volcano, which stands at 3,776m (12,386ft).  Have a mountain break in Bariloche  Set in stunning Andean scenery, beautiful Bariloche is enthralling whatever the season. In the summer, you can hike hillside trails, kick back with a fishing rod or hop on a horse or mountain bike. As winter arrives, so do the skiers, with reliable powder attracting snow fanatics worldwide. Last but not least, don't leave without trying its famous locally-made chocolate.  Head north to colonial Salta  This lively university city is peppered with colonial Spanish architecture. Drop in on the nearby pre-Inca ruins at Santa Rosa de Tastil, before travelling through the stunning red gorge of the Quebrada de Humahuaca, scattered with verdant oases. Horse riding treks amid the arid, rose-tinted mountains around Salta are a popular way of taking in the area's distinctive natural backdrop.  Hike around Nahuel Huapi  This superb national park in the Argentine Lake District tempts trekkers and sightseers alike with its many natural beauties, including extinct Tronador Volcano, alpine meadows and amazing fauna. The sprawling glacial lake, Lake Nahuel Huapi, stretches over 100km (63 miles) to the border with Chile; the lake contains a nature reserve, Isla Victoria, which you can visit by private boat or organised excursion.  Raft down the Manso  Charge down wild rapids on the River Manso, near Bariloche. This thunderous force of nature, shooting through rocky canyons and forests, rises from the glaciers at the foothills of Mount Tronador and wends its way through to Chile. Other top white water rafting options are the River Atuel near San Rafael or the Juramento Rapids near Salta.  Ride like a gaucho in the Pampas  These flat and fertile lowlands near Buenos Aires provide optimum respite from hectic city life. Head out into the Pampas and stay at an estancia (Argentine-style ranch), many of which offer horse riding around the local beauty spots, open log fires in the winter months and a banquet of fine grilled meat.  Sample Mendoza’s fine wines  Mendoza is one of Argentina's key wine regions, with nearly two thirds of the country's wine produced here, in the Andean foothills. Taste some of the New World's best tipples and learn about winemaking at a traditional bodega (winery). You can tour the region's wineries, from boutique bodegas to major wine labels, many offering guided tours, fine dining and lodging.  Ski down the Andes  When the snow falls, it's time to zoom down the eastern slopes of the Andes. The best time to go skiing in Argentina is May to September. Bariloche is the most established ski destination, while Las Leñas is a large upmarket resort; this remote, purpose-built ski centre, near Malargüe, offers a well-stocked village and access to world-class advanced slopes.  Take a shower in the Iguazú Falls  Aptly named 'great waters' by the Guarani Indians, the magnificent Iguazú Falls are set in the lush jungle of Iguazú National Park, packed with exotic birds and plant life. The highest of the 275 separate falls is the Garganta del Diablo, standing nearly twice the height of the Niagara Falls; visitors can get up close via viewing platforms and spray-drenched catwalks.  Tango til dawn in Buenos Aires  The heady capital city is a vibrant mix of Argentine culture and cosmopolitan city life. This is a full-on, round-the-clock city, with a bustling centre by day, street cafés packed well into the evening, late night feasting at gourmet grills and tango halls that go on way past dawn.  Travel to the ‘Ends of the Earth’ at Tierra del Fuego  Gateway to the Antarctic, Tierra del Fuego is a windswept archipelago of craggy peaks, ancient forests and sprawling estancias, shared by Argentina and neighbouring Chile. A magnet for naturalists and adventurers, the region offers boat safaris through the Beagle Channel, fishing, horse riding, hiking, or exploring Ushuaia, the world's most southerly city.  Watch glaciers calve at Los Glaciares National Park  This magnificent park runs for 170km (106 miles) along the border with Chile; it is characterised by rugged mountains and clear lakes. The most popular glacier is the mighty Perito Moreno, where massive chunks of ice shear off and fall into Lago Argentino to form icebergs. You can view the advancing Perito Moreno Glacier from catwalks, from boat trips or even by walking on it.  Watch whales in Puerto Madryn  The beautiful nature reserve Peninsula Valdés situated near the Patagonian town Puerto Madryn is Argentina's prime whale-watching location. From June until December is the best time to spot southern right whales in its temperate waters. Head there in September and October to see the whales with their young, as well as the bulky masses of elephant seals basking on the shoreline.",south america,,
martinique,"When he discovered Martinique in 1493, Christopher Columbus gushed that it was “the most beautiful country in the world”. Since then this island has lost little of the magic that so captivated the great explorer: it remains one of the most beautiful destinations you are likely to visit.      Originally inhabited by Arawak and Carib Indians, who were swiftly eradicated by the French, the island has been hotly fought over. The British made numerous attempts to occupy Martinique during the 18th and 19th centuries, but it has remained defiantly French since 1635 (along with nearby Guadeloupe).       Tourism represents a major part of the local economy and each year hundreds of thousands of visitors come to enjoy Martinique's picturesque volcanic landscape, luscious rainforests and fine beaches, which are lined with sugar, palm, banana and pineapple plantations.      An accommodating people, most Martinicans are of mixed ancestry, being the descendants of 17th century French settlers and slaves brought from Africa to work on the island's plantations. This French and Creole heritage is infused in local customs, food and languages, which is a joy for travellers.      Do make sure you pack your dancing shoes. It’s impossible to escape zouk, the lively, two-beat local music that is similar to merengue in the Dominican Republic, but is unique to the French West Indies. Martinicans are very proud of their zouk, which will provide the soundtrack to your trip.      If you need a bit of Dutch courage to get on the dance floor, you’re in luck, because Martinique produces fine rum. So exceptional is the liquor, in fact, that it was awarded the prestigious French label appellation d'origine controlee, which was previously only reserved for mainland produce.","Martinique  Attractions in Martinique  Admire the Arawak artefacts at Musée Départemental  Pay a visit to the Musée Départemental, which tells the story of the island through a series of artefacts. Housed in a colonial building and focussing predominantly on Arawak and Carib Indian prehistory, the museum offers an interesting insight into island life before Christopher Columbus landed in the early 16th century.  Bathe in the beaches of Pointe du Bout  In the south of the island is Pointe du Bout, Martinique's major resort area. Sainte-Anne, Le Diamant and Les Anses d'Arlets have some of the island's best bathing beaches. HMS Diamond Rock, 4km (2.5 miles) off Diamant, is a rock which was designated a man-of-war by the British during the Napoleonic wars and rates a 12-gun salute from passing British warships.  Call in at the Cathedral of St-Louis  Inspired by Paris' Eiffel Tower, the Cathedral of St-Louis is a late 17th-century cathedral with a Roman-style bell tower. Peaking above the Fort-de-France skyline, the Gothic revival structure is a stand out sight in the capital and its bright, atmospheric interior is also the final resting place of many of the island's former governors.  Dive down and see shipwrecks  Visit the wrecks of the ships which were in the harbour on the day Montagne Pelée erupted – all but one of them went down in the disaster. Special submarines with glass windows take tourists to view the wrecks and the colourful fish that swim around them. It is also possible to dive down to get that little bit closer.  Explore the Pearl of the Caribbean destroyed by Montagne Pelée  Montagne Pelée, the 1,430m (4,700ft) volcanic mountain in the north, last erupted in 1902 destroying the city of St Pierre. Known as the ""Pearl of the Caribbean"", the remains are now a tourist attraction. Old stone stairways and the ruined theatre still exist, while its notable historic buildings like the old customs house are being rebuilt and restored.  Make a splash by snorkelling, skiing and sailing  Water based activities are abundant in Martinique. Whether you want to water-ski, explore the bays in a sailboat, scuba-dive, snorkel, or try your hand at spearfishing, many coastal resorts offer all. Take part in the Aqua Festival, a sailing event held each year around the Bay of Robert, or watch the yachting regatta held every June in Le Marin.  Pay a visit to a plantation at Le Carbet  Le Carbet is where Columbus landed on his fourth voyage in 1502. The Centre d'Art Paul Gauguin can be found in the town and contains exhibits relating to the painter's stay in the area, including the work he did whilst here. Nearby, the restored plantation of Leyritz welcomes visitors to stay in restored stone cottages.  Saddle up and explore the countryside  Horse riding is a very enjoyable way to see Martinique's lovely countryside, so saddle up for a coastline canter. For those that wish to see the island under their own steam will find easy hiking trails, whilst mountain biking and climbing are both catered for. There is also horseracing to be enjoyed at Hippodrome de Carrère, Lamentin.   Sample the island's rum  Sampling Martinique's island rum is a must. Distilleries abound throughout the island and all of them welcome visitors for a sampling of their product. The St James Distillery at Sainte-Marie in the north operates the Musée du Rhum and Rhum Clement Domaine Acajou, in Le François on the east coast, also has a fine contemporary museum.  Wander the winding streets of Fort-de-France  Winding streets and colourful markets make the island's capital, Fort-de-France, a delightful spot. Seek out the park of La Savanne and the statue which commemorates Napoleon's Empress Josephine, a native of Martinique. Her home, La Pagerie, is one of the main tourist attractions and her birthplace, La Pagerie, has a museum chock full of her mementos.",caribbean,,
prince edward island,"Time seems to slow down in tiny Prince Edward Island, whose singing sands, scrummy food and friendly people pack a tantalising punch. Every inch of Canada’s smallest province grabs your attention, from the red-sandy beaches and soaring cliffs to historic coastal communities, colourfully painted lighthouses and dazzling autumnal foliage. Even entering PEI across the 13km (8 mile) Confederation Bridge, the longest bridge over ice-covered waters worldwide, is elating.      You can take your pick from a handful of scenic driving routes, or join legions of hikers and cyclists and traverse the entire island via the 410km (255 mile) Confederation Trail. Arrive in winter, and glide along the gently graded trail by snowmobile.      PEI claims the warmest waters north of the Carolinas, and its sandy beaches and cute cottages bring visitors back year after year for splashing, snorkelling and lazing around. If you have the energy for more than sinking into the sand and flicking the pages on a good book, bring a spade and dig up giant clams.      Being out on the water here means pottering around coastal bays and hidden nooks by kayak or setting sail to spot seals and seabirds. For a taste of as-fresh-as-it-gets seafood, try your hand at catching mussels and lobster on a deep-sea fishing charter.      As well as great piles of fresh seafood, PEI dishes up a locally grown feast of fresh produce, from asparagus to strawberries. Whatever you order for dinner, it’s likely to have been plucked straight from the ocean or the nearest field.      Lounging on the beach, paddling around limpid bays, chomping on delicious seafood: it will be with a heavy heart that you get back on that bridge.","Prince Edward Island  Attractions in Prince Edward Island  Anne of Green Gables  Green Gables, the farmhouse immortalised in the book Anne of Green Gables by Lucy Maud Montgomery and now a popular museum, is in Prince Edward Island National Park at Cavendish (www.annemuseum.com). To the west is Montgomery's birthplace New London, where her house is also a museum.  Beaches  On the northern shore of Prince Edward Island National Park, the beaches are protected by cliffs and dunes; it is particularly well suited for swimming. Other good beaches are at Cavendish, Brackley, Basin Head, Sandspit, Blooming Point, Cedar Dunes.  Cross the Confederation Bridge  This 13km (8-mile) engineering marvel connects the island to the mainland. It's Canada's longest bridge, and the world's longest over ice-covered waters. Journeying across the vast expanse of water is a truly exhilarating experience.  Deep-sea fishing  Chartered deep-sea fishing boats are widely available from July to September, most commonly for cod, mackerel and flounder. The island's waters are particularly renowned for giant bluefin tuna.  Deer and bison  Famiiles enjoy observing bison in an enclosure and watching white-tailed deer in Buffaloland Provincial Park.  Friendly Charlottetown  The provincial capital, Charlottetown, is a colonial-era seaport with tree-lined streets and wood-framed houses. Main sites are Province House, where the 1864 discussions leading to the Canadian Confederation were held, and the Confederation Centre of the Arts (www.confederationcentre.com), housing an art gallery and theatre.  Golf  You can golf on one of more than two dozen golf courses on Prince Edward Island, from facilities suitable for learners and families to championship layouts by top designers. Many are members of Golf PEI (www.golfpei.ca).  Gorgeous capes  The 45km (25 miles) of fine white-sand beaches and Prince Edward Island's trademark red sandstone capes in Prince Edward Island National Park beckon photographers and nature lovers.  Historic lighthouse  Point Prim, located on a long promontory to the southeast, has the oldest lighthouse on the island, built in 1846 and still in use.  Leaf peeping  The warm waters of the Gulf Stream, which passes just offshore, have a moderating influence on the island's climate, resulting in one of the longest autumn foliage viewing periods in North America. The best time to take scenic forest walks is from mid September until late October.  Put the foot to the pedal over Trans Canada Trail  The island's many recommended cycling routes, including include the 270km (168-mile) Confederation Trail. This section of the Trans Canada Trail runs from Tignish in the west to Elmira in the east, with several interconnecting lines branching off to virtually every corner of the province.  Scenic drives  Routes include the Central Coastal Drive, from Charlottetown to Port-la-Joye-Fort Amherst; the North Cape Coastal Drive, with Acadian history at Miscouche and Mont Carmel; and the Points East Coastal Drive, which traverses the hilly farmland of the eastern interior.  Seal watching  Spotting seals is a popular activity near Murray River in the Points East Coastal Drive region.  Sumptuous seafood  The International Shellfish Festival (www.peishellfish.com) in September offers a fantastic chance to munch on lobster and chowder from some of Canada and the world's top gourmet chefs and celebrity cooks.  Winter fun  There are excellent facilities for cross-country skiing at Brookvale Winter Activity Park, which hosted the 1991 Canada Winter Games. Prince Edward Island has over 1,100km (688 miles) of snowmobiling trails.",north america,canada,
tunisia,"From broad sweeps of beach overlooked by a tumble of sugar-cube houses, to grand ancient ruins and the vast, rolling dunes of the Sahara, Tunisia encapsulates everything that’s enticing about North Africa.      Lose yourself in the maze of medina alleyways inTunis, explore the Maghreban mosques of Kairouan and stand on the shimmering salt flats of Chott El Jerid. Tuck into freshly baked brik at a bustling street market, pretend to be a Roman gladiator at El Jem’s impressive amphitheatre and hoist yourself onto a camel for a trip into the desert.      Traditionally, sun-seeking tourists came to Tunisia for its beaches – lining the Mediterranean, the long, rambling coastline is impressive. There are also tiny coastal villages where fishermen haul in the day’s catch on quiet beaches and cobblestone streets are lined with blooming bougainvillea.      But Tunisia is so much more than a seaside destination where visitors lounge on the sands all day long. Join the locals at a café after the last notes of the call to prayer have faded, or puff on apple-scented shisha as you watch old men play dominos. Alternatively, get scrubbed and steamed on a marble slab under the tiled domes of a hammam. Or haggle in the souks, sipping glasses of mint tea while you barter for the best price. Suffice to say the age-old traditions of Tunisian life are still alive and well.      Regarded as one of North Africa’s most politically moderate countries, Tunisia balances traditional Islamic culture with modern influences. Beyond the ancient medina, the cities are full of restaurants, cafes and bars, many of which have a European air about them.      Though tourism took a hit in recent years after a number of suicide attacks on tourists and the authority. The Tunisian government is working to improve security in major cities and tourist resorts.","Tunisia  Attractions in Tunisia  Bask in the glory of El-Jem  For many visitors the UNESCO World Heritage-listed El-Jem Colosseum is Tunisia's historical highlight. Built in the 3rd century, this mammoth structure once held crowds of up to 35,000 and today towers over the modern surrounding town. The largest amphitheatre in North Africa and modelled on Rome's own Colosseum, it's an example of just how far the mighty long Roman arm reached – to the very centre of Tunisia.  Cruise over sand dunes  The dramatic sand dunes of the Grand Erg Oriental ripple out in waves across the horizon. This hypnotic landscape was used in the movie The English Patient and has since become one of the most famous corners of the Sahara. From the dusty desert outpost of Douz you can organise camel treks or 4x4 trips to the dunes. Dune skiing and desert dune-buggy trips are also available.  Delve into the ruins of Dougga  This UNESCO World Heritage Site is one of North Africa's best-preserved ancient ruins. Although most of the surviving monuments here are from the Roman period, Dougga's history stretches right back to the 6th century. With its dramatic hilltop position and ample monumental buildings and temples, it is one of Tunisia's most impressive tourist attractions.  Discover the town of Sidi Bou Saïd  Gorgeously quaint and stunningly picturesque, Sidi Bou Saïd is a vision of white-and-blue buildings perched above the Mediterranean. Wander the cobblestone alleyways through the village, stop for syrupy Arabic coffee at a cliff-side cafe, and then unwind on the charmingly old-fashioned beach. It's an easy day-trip from Tunis.  Find the Force in Chott El Jerid  Stretching for 5,000 sq m (53,819 sq ft) the salt pan of Chott El Jerid has a mesmerising otherworldliness which was used to great effect in the Star Wars films. In summer, the dry salt crust blisters and shimmers in the heat, while in winter sections of it flood and have to be traversed by boat. To visit the Chott El Jerid, most people stay in Tozeur.  Get back to nature in Lake Ichkeul  In the far north of the country, World Heritage-listed Lake Ichkeul is a haven for birdwatchers and nature lovers. The best time to visit is between the months of December and March when thousands of migratory birds – including flamingos, egrets and storks – descend on the wetlands to pass the winter.  Golf your way around Monastir  Monastir is famed for its impressive seafront rabat, or fort, which was used in Monty Python's Life of Brian, as well as the sumptuous interior of Habib Bourguiba's mausoleum. But the seaside town now also attracts golf-tourism with championship courses Palm Links, El Kantaoui and the Flamingo Golf Course all in the vicinity.  Have it all on Cap Bon Peninsula  There's something for everyone on the Cap Bon Peninsula. Sun and sea-seekers will love the resort amenities at Nabuel, culture vultures can explore Kelibia's fort, the old Roman quarry at Ghar el-Khabir and the Punic ruins of Kerkouane, and everyone can enjoy El Haouaria's lovely strip of beach.  Show solidarity at Bardo Museum  One of Tunisia's most important museums, Bardo was the target of a terrorist attack in March 2015. It held a reopening ceremony a week later (with beefed-up security) coinciding with a huge solidarity march through Tunis. The museum remains an essential guide to the country's multi-faceted history, with a superlative collection of mosaics and a comprehensive range of artefacts from countless ancient sites.  Soak up cool vibes in the capital  Shaped over the centuries by a mixture of Ottoman, Arabic and French-colonial influences, Tunisia's capital is a wonderful muddle of old and new. In the shady medina back alleys, old men puff on shisha and play backgammon, while along the broad French-style avenues of the modern town, the cafes brim with bright young things toting laptops and chattering on their mobiles.  Steam with the locals in a hammam  One of Tunisia's essential experiences is to visit a hammam, a traditional 'Turkish' bath that's a mix between a public bath and a sauna, typically in a lavish, old-tiled setting. The practice dates back to Roman and Punic times, when natural hot springs were much sought. Today there are five-star spa experiences, while traditional hammams such as El-Kachachine endure as dilapidated architectural gems.  Step back in time at Bulla Regia  The semi-subterranean Roman ruin of Bulla Regia is one of Tunisia's most impressive archaeological sites. The Romans used underground architecture here to escape the brutal heat, but the unusual design also preserved the city from eroding over time, offering a rare chance to explore complete Roman villas.  Support Sousse  Like Bardo, Sousse was subject to a terrorist attack in the summer of 2015. Before then, it was a vibrant seaside town, especially Boujaffar Beach with its long stretch of white sand and lively nightlife strip, but tourism has naturally taken a hit. But Sousse has a long resilient history dating back to the Phoenicians, under whom it was an important coastal town. It will recover.  Take it easy in Djerba  The chilled-out island of Djerba is a Mediterranean idyll with its whitewashed villages, craft markets, and postage-stamp sized beaches shaded by palm trees. It's a wonderful place to relax in, doing little more strenuous than browsing the shops, enjoying leisurely lunches of fresh seafood and lounging on the sands.  Venture into the Sahara  It seems a shame to come to Tunisia without getting a taste of the dramatic desolate horizons that make up the country's southern half. A number of companies organise Sahara trips, which range from a couple of hours on a camel to a full-on voyage into the sands.  Venture under the sea around Tabarka  Tabarka is Tunisia's top spot for snorkelling and diving. The town itself is a gentle-paced seaside resort which oozes old fashioned style, and it's a lovely stop off if you want to recharge your travel batteries. Not far from shore is the magical underwater world of the Galite Islands, which are the main draw for scuba diving fans.  Visit a galaxy far, far away in Matmata  Due to a prominent role in the first Star Wars film, Matmata's subterranean dwellings, first dug out by the Berbers over 1,000 years ago, attract hundreds of visitors each day. The main attraction here is Hotel Sidi Driss, used as the cantina in Episode IV:A New Hope, and still home to plenty of Star Wars paraphernalia. You can even sleep here, troglodyte style, if the fancy takes you.  Wonder at sacred Kairouan  Kairouan's skyline of minarets is packed to the brim with beautiful Islamic architecture, not least the breath-taking 9th-century Great Mosque. Founded in 670, the city dates back to the beginning of Islam in the Maghreb and is seen as the religion's fourth holiest site. Aside from sacred landmarks, you'll spend hours exploring the labyrinthine medina, full of spindling alleyways backed by crumbling pastel-hued houses.",africa,,
wyoming,"With its vast national parks, bountiful fauna and rip-roaring Wild West heritage, the so-called Cowboy State is certainly worthy of a yee ha!      Home to the smallest population of any US state, there’s plenty of room to roam in Wyoming. Wilderness abounds, particularly in the northwestern corner, where Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks throw up dazzling scenery and more wildlife than you can keep track of.      Grizzlies, wolves and bison prowl Yellowstone, whose bubbling hot springs and spouting geysers are as thrilling to watch in winter as they are in summer.      Immediately south of Yellowstone, Grand Teton is a mesmerising landscape of spiky peaks peering down at the Jackson Hole valley over a mile below. It’s an adventurer’s paradise, crammed with hiking trails, campgrounds, lakes for kayaking and jagged pinnacles begging to be climbed.      The ultra-cool town of Jackson is a great base for both parks and a jumping-off point for skiing at Jackson Hole, where the snow runs steep and deep and green runs are for losers.      Climbers also find it hard to resist tackling the corrugated rock faces of Devils Tower, a gigantic rocky monolith jutting up from the plains of northeastern Wyoming. If that sounds a bit scary, you can hunt for ancient stingray or herring at Fossil Butte in the southwest of the state, whose limestone layers conceal the world’s largest deposit of freshwater fish fossils.      Hungry for some cowboy action? Saddle up and experience life on a working ranch or get yourself down to the nearest rodeo. For an all-out rocking rodeo extravaganza, bag tickets to Cheyenne Frontier Days in July, a raucous celebration packing in bull riding, chuckwagon cook-offs, whirring fairground rides and boot-stomping concerts.","Wyoming  Attractions in Wyoming  Big Horn Mountains  Explore the dramatic Big Horn Mountains, with the charming towns of Buffalo and Sheridan nestled at the base of the range.

bahrain,"Bahrain means 'Two Seas', a fitting name for an archipelago of 33 islands in the Gulf, which defines itself in relation to the water that surrounds its shallow shores.  Those shallows once harboured a precious trade in pearls, the most important in the world until the 19th century. Now the shoreline is increasingly dominated by ambitious developments, such as the twin 50-floor towers of Bahrain's World Trade Centre and the 2,787,000 sq m (30,000,000 sq ft) horseshoe of man-made islands at the southern tip of the country.  To those not in the know, Bahrain can seem a formidable place in the heart of the Gulf. But despite being situated just off Saudi Arabia's east coast, it is for the most part a welcoming, open country. Manama is an intriguing capital city, if not quite so glamorous is some of the region's other glittering metropolises. You'll find a decent culinary and artistic circuit, partly buoyed by westerners living here. Expect plenty of craft markets and pottery workshops.  For history buffs, Bahrain is the location of ancient Dilmun, home to what was an important semitic civilisation in the Bronze Age; Bahrain was later conquered by Babylonians and Persians. There are a number of ruins, burial mounds and forts to explore.  In the middle of Bahrain, not far from where the Formula 1 racetrack now draws the crowds, is the point where in 1932 the Arab world first struck gold – black gold, that is – and oil has been the mainstay of the country ever since. As visitors travel the modest length of Bahrain, they will run into many reminders of this momentous discovery, not least in the relaxed affluence of Bahrain's multicultural residents. Indeed, there are many signs of Arabian style and influence, along with more cosmopolitan vibes.  Since 2011, when the Arab Spring swept across the region, Bahrain's fate has been an uncertain one. The initial wave of protests by the largely Shia population against the Sunni rulers were put down with the help of Saudi Arabia, but demonstrations and unrest persist. Check the current situation before travelling.","Bahrain  Attractions in Bahrain  Cruise out to the Hawar Islands  Take a 40-minute boat ride to the Hawar Islands, an archipelago of desert islands, and look out for the dolphins that play in the calm Gulf seas. It's not all about these playful mammals, though: flamboyant flamingos also stalk the shallow waters. They're much easier to spot.  Dine at the Causeway Restaurant  Order an egg rollup and coffee at the Causeway Restaurant, which offers stunning views of one of the most impressive engineering feats in Arabia: the King Fahd Causeway; a 25km (16 mile), four-lane bridge that links Bahrain with Saudi Arabia.  Dive into Bahrain’s history  Visitors can learn about Bahrain's once-thriving pearl industry at the Bahrain National Museum, which charts the history of this tiny nation. The museum is located between Manama and the city of Murharraq, a UNESCO World Heritage Site that was built on the pearl industry: listed buildings include the residences of wealthy merchants, shops, storehouses and a mosque. For a more immersive experience you can dive for pearls yourself at Dar Island Resort.  Explore the house of Bait Al Jasra  Located in the rustic village of Al Jasra, this house is the birthplace of the late Emir of Bahrain, Isa bin Salman Al Khalifa, and is an exquisite example of traditional Bahraini architecture. The village itself is also worthy of a wander, with its souks, craft centre and sea views.  Get lost in Bab Al Bahrain souk  One of Manama's oldest buildings, Bab Al Bahrain is a local landmark. As well as traditional Arabian architecture and lavish water features, it offers visitors the chance to get lost in its souks. Enjoy the nosegays of cardamom, coffee, apricot, sheesha, kebabs and heady incense-laced perfumes as you barter with the local hawkers.  Hang out in hip Adliya  The bohemian neighbourhood of Adliya is the place to be seen in Manama. Buzzing with lively bars and restaurants, it is vaunted as one of the best places for a night out in Bahrain. As well as chic eateries, cocktail bars and nightclubs, Adliya is home to a collection of art galleries and cafés, where locals and tourists go to socialise.  Hole up in Bahrain Fort  Take a Portuguese-eyed view of the sea from the strategic Bahrain Fort, which was built in the 16th-century and recently restored to its former no-nonsense grandeur. It gained UNESCO status in 2005 and is one of the country's most popular tourist attractions.  Pretend to be a racing driver  One of the latest additions to the F1 calendar, the Bahrain Grand Prix burns rubber once a year at the Bahrain International Circuit. But when the professionals aren't battling it out on the bitumen, amateur petrol heads are: the track is available (at a fee) for anyone who wants to play racing driver. Tours of the circuit are available, which include a lap of the track.  See a performance at the National Theatre  Opened in 2012, the Bahrain National Theatre hosts performances from leading lights in the world of classical music, opera and ballet. Overlooking the sea, near the Bahrain National Museum, the building is beautiful inside and out. As well as an opera theatre, it houses a café, which is a fine place to watch the world go by.  Sit beneath the Tree of Life  Standing alone in the desert, the Tree of Life has become something of a tourist attraction in Bahrain – by virtue of its loneliness. Thought to be around 400 years old, incredibly the Tree of Life attracts some 50,000 pilgrims annually and is said to be a site for sects practising ancient rites.  Slip inside the Oil Museum  It might destroy the environment and be the catalyst for wars, but the Bahrain economy was built on black gold and the stuff is jovially celebrated at the Oil Museum near Manama. Telling the story of oil from its beginnings to present day, its grand white building is quaintly at odds with the nodding donkeys and sprawling pipelines of the neighbouring vicinity.  Stock up on bling at Gold City  Barter for bangles in Bahrain's glittering Gold City; a bling-tastic collection of jewellery shops that will bedazzle even the most jaded of shoppers. Located in central Manama, Gold City is a place where many a credit card is melted – you've been warned.  Visit the Dilmun Burial Mounds  Incredibly, roughly 5% of Bahrain's limited landmass is taken up by ancient burial mounds, which dominate the landscape near the town of A'Ali. Thought to be one of the largest cemeteries in the ancient world, there are around 170,000 people buried here.",middle east,,
saudi arabia,"No country in the world is as misunderstood as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and perhaps no other country is worthy of a visit.      Saudi Arabia is an incredibly dynamic tourist destination, boasting seemingly endless sand dunes, palm-shaded oases, dramatic mountaintops and numerous marine reserves and wildlife sanctuaries.      In the west of the country you will find untamed stretches of coral-filled Red Sea coast and southwestern mountain towns such as Taif, famed for producing rose oil and rose water. The ancient history in the north is perhaps one of the country's greatest draws – the region of Al-Jouf is packed with ancient castle ruins and massive pillars carved from sandstone dating back thousands of years, while the city of AlUla is the gateway to the Hegra Archaeological Site, which features a collection of stone dwellings similar to Petra in Jordan.      A large part of the country is desert and the sands are wondrous. The Empty Quarter (Rub' al-Khali), a beautiful expanse of undulating dunes unlike anywhere in the world, is a must-see.      Then there are the cosmopolitan cities of Jeddah (on the Red Sea coast), Riyadh (the capital), and Dammam (on the Persian Gulf), all of which have undergone a remarkable cultural transformation, successfully blending ancient customs and ever-evolving lifestyles in the modern world. Here, visitors can also find world-class museums, fine-dining options, and fantastic shopping choices.      Saudi Arabia is also rich in culture and heritage. It is, after all, the birthplace of Prophet Muhammad and home to the two holiest sites in Islam: the Grand Mosque (Masjid al-Haram) in Makkah and the Prophet's Mosque (Al-Masjid an-Nabawi) in Medina; both of which draw millions of visitors each year. Understandably, the Saudis take pride in protecting the integrity of this holy land.      Saudi Arabia is perhaps an elusive and mysterious place, steeped in religion and cultural tradition to a novice visitor. But if you're willing to come for a visit, you'll discover a magnificent country with much to offer.","Saudi Arabia  Attractions in Saudi Arabia  AlUla (Al-Ula)  The city of AlUla is perhaps Saudi's best-kept secret, but it won't be for long. The landscape is stunning – expect everything from unique rock formations in the desert to pre-Arabic rock inscriptions and palm-shaded oases. Another must-see is the Hegra Archaeological Site, the Kingdom's first UNESCO World Heritage Site, which dates back to the 1st-century BCE when the Nabataean civilisation flourished in the region.  Farasan Islands  An archipelago off the coast of Jazan in southwest Saudi Arabia, Farasan excites visitors with pristine beaches, colourful coral reefs, carbon-capturing mangroves and high diversity of marine life. This wildlife sanctuary is definitely one for divers, swimmers, snorkelers, marine biologists and wildlife enthusiasts to explore.  Jebel Fihrayn (the Edge of the World)  The nickname of Jebel Fihrayn is the Edge of the World, and you instantly understand why when you climb to the top of the massive cliffs and enjoy panoramic vistas of dried rivers meandering through the land and rocky desert shimmering in the distance. This geological wonder is located 99km (62mi) northwest of Riyadh.  Jeddah  A vibrant port city on the Red Sea coast, Jeddah has long been the gateway for pilgrims travelling to Makkah but the city never stops to reinvent itself. Jeddah remains uniquely different from other Saudi cities, setting trends with museums, art galleries, outdoor gyms, and now the longest F1 street circuit snaking along the glorious coastline. King Fahd's Fountain, the world's tallest, is another must-see sight.  Makkah (Mecca)  The Holy City of Makkah, only accessible to Muslims, is packed with sacred sites, including the Ka'aba, a cuboid-shaped shrine in the heart of the Grand Mosque (Masjid al-Haram), the historic Cave of Thawr where Prophet Muhammad once sought refuge from an attacking tribe, and Jabal Rahmah, where the Prophet delivered his last sermon.  Riyadh  Riyadh, Saudi Arabia's capital, is sure to surprise and delight travellers. Its gleaming skyscrapers contrast with labyrinthine souqs, offering a fitting backdrop to a progressive city that is also deeply rooted in culture and tradition. Visitors can trace the city's history at Al Masmak Fortress and Diriyah – the latter's mud-brick walls once encircled a thriving ancient settlement.  The Al-Jouf (Al-Jawf) Province  Located near the Saudi-Jordanian border, Al-Jouf greets visitors with a sea of olive trees – this place is home to the largest olive farm in the world and celebrates an Olive Festival every January. Away from the evergreen shrubs, Al-Jouf offers spectacular ancient castles and Rajajil, a burial site featuring more than 50 standing stones carved from ochre sandstone thousands of years ago.  The Asir (Aseer) Province  Nestled in the southwestern corner, the Asir region boasts lofty mountains, winding valleys, ancient villages, and a vast protected area known as Asir National Park, which undoubtedly is the jewel in the crown here. The region is crisscrossed with hiking trails and campsites. For an extraordinary experience, take a cable car to the 400-year-old Hanging Village of Al Habala, built on the ledge of a cliff by the Qahtan tribe.  The Incense Route  The Incense Route is a network of paths connecting southern Arabia to the Mediterranean by skirting along the Red Sea coast. The caravan merchants carrying myrrh and frankincense may have long gone, but intrepid visitors today can drive a stretch of the Incense Route from Abha in the south to Tabuk in the north, passing through ancient villages such as Al Habala, Zee Ain, Al Balad, AlUla, Hegra, and Dadan.",middle east,,
antarctica,"Amidst the solitude of Antarctica, adventurous travellers can discover an ethereal landscape that lingers in the memory. Very few have ventured onto this appealingly inaccessible continent, but those who have rave about the privilege of gazing upon towering mountains, bulky glaciers and luminous, dreamlike icebergs. Perhaps more than anywhere else, Antarctica reminds those who visit it of the awesome (and savage) power of nature.      Antarctica is welcoming more tourist-orientated cruises and ferries to the region every year, and facilities are continually developing, with more accommodation, culinary and travel options available. There is now ample opportunity to ascend Mount Erebus, the southernmost active volcano on Earth; to fly via helicopter or venture by boat to penguin colonies; and to really make the most of a terrain that teems with wildlife, with a multitude of birds, seals, albatrosses and enormous whales.      Some argue that Antarctica is changing, and by man-made causes rather than natural ones. Many regard the increasing focus on tourism as disconcerting and wish to preserve Antarctica in its elemental state to avoid any potential environmental damage. Antarctica is still a magical experience that most, given the chance, would find hard to resist. Those who do visit should be aware of their impact upon the landscape and do their utmost to limit the effect of their stay.       Perhaps the reason behind the fascination with Antarctica is its function as a symbol of endurance and survival. Before Antarctica was first spotted (in 1819), the continent was the subject of constant speculation, spoken of in almost mythical terms as Terra Australia Incognita (The Unknown Southern Land). Humans first occupied the continent in 1899, but Antarctica seemed inhospitable and incomprehensible and, in many ways, it still is.","Antarctica  Attractions in Antarctica  Admire the hardy wildlife  Come to Antarctica and you can take advantage of some of the best wildlife viewing in the world. Elephant and Weddell seals, emperor, chinstrap and Adelié penguins and humpback and minke whales are just a few of the regulars spotted in these chilly waters.  Brush up on your Antarctic history  Antarctica was the scene of intense rivalry between some of the world's greatest polar explorers such as Earnest Shackleton and Robert Scott. Brave visitors can follow in their footsteps in Antarctica, though reading about their endeavours from aboard your boat is a far more comfortable way to learn about these great men.  Climb Observation Hill  Observation Hill, a 30-minute ascent from nearby McMurdo, awards intrepid travellers with magnificent views of Mount Erebus and the Ross Ice Shelf, plus the 'Royal Societies' range across the ice. You will also find here the Memorial Cross erected in honour of Captain Robert Scott and his polar party.  Deceive your senses on Deception Island  Living up to its name, Deception Island is revered for its thermal springs, but don't be fooled: the water here is nowhere near as warm as some might have you believe. Located in the South Shetland archipelago, the island was a former whaling station and the rusting remains of this bloody industry litter the island – along with decaying whalebones.  Hop in a helicopter for a bird’s eye view  If you've got the cash then hire a chopper and get a bird's eye view of polar animals (including penguins and albatrosses) in their natural environment. Though unaffordable for most Antarctic explorers, helicopters offer the best access to the continent's emperor penguin colonies.  Kayak around icebergs  For an even closer view of the glistening blue-tinted ice of Antarctica, hop in a kayak and go for a paddle. If the weather permits you may even be able to camp on the ice. Kayaking and camping trips are offered as part of some expedition voyages.  Kick back on an Antarctic cruise  Explore this icy continent the lazy way, by taking a cruise around some of the most dramatic scenery in the world. Most trips depart from Ushuaia (in Argentina) or Punta Arenas (in Chile), and the passage from South America to the Antarctic Peninsula takes approximately two days.  Run the Antarctica Marathon  Hardcore runners can test their mettle in one of the most inhospitable places on Earth, by signing up to the Antarctica Marathon on King George Island. Participants must brave sub-zero temperatures and biting winds as they complete the course. For those less brave, there's also a half-marathon.  Send a postcard from Port Lockroy  Impress your friends by sending them a postcard from the only post office in Antarctica, at Port Lockroy, which used to be a British station and is now a museum to early Antarctic exploration. It is one of Antarctica's most popular attractions, designated as Historic Site Number 61 under the Antarctic Treaty.  View the night sky in all its glory  Unspoiled by light pollution, Antarctica puts on one of the greatest cosmos displays in the world. Gaze up at night and delight in an exceptionally clear sky full of stars.",antarctica,,
quebec,"Chic cities, eye-catching landscapes and welcoming people, passionate about their heritage: Québec has created a French-North American cocktail, and it tastes good.      Canada’s largest province encompasses vast tracts of barren mountains, 13,323km (8,279 miles) of coastline, looming canyons and craggy fjords. Thrilling sights grab you at every turn as you explore this mainly French-speaking region, where you can swim with beluga whales in Saguenay Fjord, visit 400-year-old clifftop houses on the Chemin du Roy and spot herds of caribou roaming the Parc National des Grands-Jardins.      Alternatively, you could don the Lycra and pedal around La Route Verte, an immense 5,000km (3,100 miles) network of cycle trails, which take riders through the pretty villages of the Eastern Townships, along the stunning coast of Lac Saint-Jean and down the disused Laurentides railway.      Québec is a giant water park: there are countless sandy beaches, lakes and rivers for swimming; the St Lawrence River is a magnet for kayakers, who also have a phenomenal number of inland waterways to choose from, such as the Bonaventure River in the Gaspé Peninsula.      Hikers can enjoy 100km (62 miles) of mountainous trails on the Traversée de Charlevoix or trek Québec’s portion of the International Appalachian Trail. In winter, skiers rip up the slopes at Mont Tremblant.      Craving city action? Hip and happening Montreal is an alluring blend of glitzy skyscrapers and historic cobblestone quarters, with cosmopolitan neighbourhoods and a buzzing cultural scene. As for UNESCO-listed Québec City, you can have a ball diving in and out of tiny eateries and bijou boutiques tucked among the fortified city’s 17th-century alleyways.","Quebec  Attractions in Quebec  Admire stain glass artwork in Lower Town  Québec City's 'Lower Town' is a thicket of 17th-century streets centred on Place Royale. For art lovers, the Notre-Dame de Québec Basilica houses a unique collection.  Culture in Montréal  Place des Arts is the home of the Montréal Symphony Orchestra and several theatres offering year-round drama, music, ballet and opera. Both the Montréal Museum of Fine Arts and the Museum of Contemporary Arts of Montréal have good collections.  Cycling  La Route Verte (the 'Green Circuit') boasts over 4,000km (2,485 miles) of marked paths and roadways. The St Lawrence River Valley is good for moderate cycling, while the hilly Laurentians region is more challenging. Mountain bike enthusiasts head for parks and nature reserves, especially Parc de la Jacques-Cartier and Mont-Sainte-Anne, both within easy reach of Québec City.  Feel festive at the Winter Carnival  Québec City's Winter Carnival (www.carnaval.qc.ca/en), held in late January to mid February, is one of the largest Lenten festival in the world. It is a thrilling spectacle of parties, ice baths, dog sled races, ice palaces, sculptures and snowmobile races.  Gaspé  In the Gaspésie region, highlights include the Rocher Percé ('the pierced rock', a massive, arched sandstone rock rising from the Atlantic), and Gaspésie Provincial Park, which protects herds of caribou in a beautiful landscape of woods, lakes and streams.  Montréal architecture  Cosmopolitan metropolis Montréal has an unusual underworld - a series of underground shopping and recreation complexes, linked by walkways and the metro, and centred on Place Ville-Marie. Other architectural highlights include the Biodôme (the former Olympic velodrome, now an exotic indoor zoo), and the fascinating Canadian Centre for Architecture.  Old Montréal  Vieux-Montréal, the historic waterfront section, has been carefully restored and contains many beautiful buildings and gathering places including Place Jacques-Cartier; the former French governor's residence, Château Ramezay; the city's oldest chapel, Notre-Dame-de-Bonsecours; and Pointe-à-Callière, the Montréal Museum of Archaeology and History.  Québec City  Old city walls and green copper roofs are the defining characteristics of Québec City. The provincial capital is the only fortified city in North America and is one of the most 'European' cities on the continent, with a 95% Francophone population. A UNESCO World Heritage Site, it celebrated its 400th anniversary in 2008.  Skiing and snowboarding  Québec boasts outstanding winter sports facilities, a long season, plentiful snow and around 80 ski centres. The main regions are the Laurentians, the Eastern Townships and the Greater Québec/Charlevoix area. Cross-country skiing is very popular, as are snowmobiling, snowshoe trekking, ice fishing and ice climbing.  Taste treats  Québec is home to countless food and drink festivals, such as the many events celebrating the maple syrup harvest from March until mid April. Érablières (maple farms) and cabanes à sucre (sugar shacks) are sprinkled through the province. You can watch the harvest and sample maple toffee (made by pouring molten syrup onto fresh snow).  The marvellous Magdalens  Miles of white sandy beaches and a host of unspoilt fishing villages await intrepid travellers in the Magdalen Islands, 215km (134 miles) east of the Gaspé Peninsula in the Gulf of St Lawrence.  Upper Town  While in Québec City, you can wander through the cobblestoned streets and shaded squares of the 'Upper Town', which has fine 18th- and 19th-century architecture, notably the Place D'Armes and the iconic Fairmont Le Château Frontenac hotel (www.fairmont.com/frontenac). Energetic tourists climb 310 wooden steps to the Citadel, which affords incredible views across the river.  Vikings and geology  The Duplessis region (part of a bigger, largely rural area called the Côte-Nord) is the site of some of the earliest landfalls in the New World, made by the Vikings. The bizarre geological formations of nearby Mingan Archipelago are best explored by boat.  Watersports  If you're an outdoorsy type, you can enjoy a variety of watersports, from white-water rafting (especially on the Rivière Rouge) to gentle boating. Canoes, kayaks and sailboards are available to hire in many provincial and national parks. The St Lawrence River has excellent facilities for sailing.  Whale watching  From May to October, whale-watching tour passengers can see up to 12 species including humpbacks in the St Lawrence. In early March, thousands of harp seals give birth on the ice floes of the Magdalen Islands. You can take a helicopter ride over the area. Be forewarned that this is also the season of the controversial seal hunt, so you may encounter both hunters and activists.  Wild western Québec  The Outaouais region of western Québec, near Ottawa, is home to aerial parks where you can walk or zip line through the forest canopy, white-water rafting spots, caves, bungee jumping sites, unspoiled Gatineau Park and Omega Park (www.parc-omega.com), as well as one of the largest log buildings in the world (now the Fairmont Le Château Montebello hotel).",north america,canada,
burundi,"For all its wondrous landscapes (think undulating mountain ranges, dense rainforests and shimmering lakes), travellers are advised to steer clear of Burundi right now – the scenery might be beautiful, but the political situation is decidedly ugly.      Civil unrest, an abortive military coup and controversial elections have dominated the headlines in Burundi recently, which is a great shame given what this country has to offer.      The vibrant if tumultuous capital, Bujumbura, has a prime location on the shores of Lake Tanganyika and just outside the city are some of the best inland beaches in Africa, plus a number of idyllic beachfront bars and resorts.      The city itself has some interesting examples of French architecture and has developed a reputation for its vibrant nightlife, but infrastructural development has been hindered by decades of sporadic conflict that culminated in 1994 and left more than 300,000 dead.      Further beyond the city limits, the four beautiful waterfalls at Chutes de la Karera are well worth a visit, as are a few of the largely unexplored and underdeveloped national parks. Parc National de la Rusiza is the most accessible, just 15km (9 miles) from Bujumbura, while Parc National de la Kibira is the largest rainforest in Burundi and is home to rare colobus monkeys and chimpanzees.      An advantage of Burundi’s small size is that if you have your own vehicle or hire a driver, it’s generally easy to visit any of these highlights and return to Bujumbura within the same day; public transport, however, is limited outside the city.      Burundi has made tentative progress towards peace and stability since a power-sharing government was set up in 2001 and most rebel groups agreed to disarm, but in 2015 President Nkurunziza’s bid to change the constitution and stand for a third term sparked mass protests and a violent response from the state.      Hundreds of thousands of Burundians have fled into neighbouring Tanzania, fearing the collapse of the country’s fragile democracy and a return to civil war. Watch this space.","Burundi  Attractions in Burundi  Admire the flora and fauna  For a small nation, Burundi has a diverse series of habitats, ranging from savannah to blooming fields and mountain forests that are home to myriad species of both plant and animal life. Just 15km (9miles) from the capital, Rusizi National Park provides a wetland habitat for hippos, while Ruvubu National Park also contains a sizable population of leopards.  Be beguiled by Gitega  Gaze across the beautiful vistas of Burundi's central plains from the mountaintops of the Congo-Nile range in Gitega before exploring the second city's exquisite charm, from the history of the ibwani (or Royal Court) and National Museum, to the natural beauty of the Chutes de la Kagera waterfalls.  Echo Stanley’s famed words  Around 10km (6miles) south of Bujumbura is a large stone that is said to mark the historic first meeting between Stanley and Livingstone in 1871. Having pushed through equatorial Africa from the coast to locate the lost missionary and explorer David Livingstone, Stanley is supposed to have been mortified when all he could muster was 'Dr Livingstone, I presume?'  Experience drumming rituals  Located on a hilltop outside the town of Gitega, Gishora Drum Sanctuary was founded by King Mwezi Gisabo at the end of the 19th century to protect the ritual drums of the royal court. Today, a reconstructed palace houses the retinue drums used to announce important events, and two important unplayed drums named Ruciteme and Murimirwa.  Explore the capital  On Lake Tanganyika's northern shore, Bujumbura is a bustling city of 200,000 people. Growing in size after German colonisation in the 19th century, the city centre still includes a number of colonial-era buildings, including the Postmaster's House. Other attractions include an excellent market, the Islamic Cultural Centre, and the museé vivant, a reconstructed open-air village displaying Burundian culture.  Go birdwatching  Located around Kirundo, in the far north of Burundi, Cohoha, Rweru and Rwihinda lakes are known locally as the best places in the country to settle down to some birdwatching. Rwihinda is even nicknamed 'Birds Lake' because of the sheer quantity of birds that settle there. Another popular birding spot is Kibira National Park.  Play the locals at urubugu  Compete with locals in the ancient game of urubugu (also known as mancala). Similar to draughts, the aim is to capture an opponent's pieces or block any legal move. It is traditionally played with pebbles, seeds or seashells on a board of hollows scooped out of the ground, or with expensive and elaborately carved wooden boards.  Reach the source of the world’s longest river  As far as Burundians are concerned (Rwandans hail it to be a narrow stream in Nyunge Forest National Park), the southernmost source of the Nile bubbles out of the ground at Kasumo, just 115km (70 miles) southeast of the capital, where a stone pyramid marks the spot.  Take to the waters of Lake Tanganyika  Whether you want to relax on its sandy beaches, kick back in waterside cafes and restaurants, become seduced by its natural beauty or take the opportunity to take to the water, Lake Tanganyika is the place to be. Thought to be the second largest freshwater lake in the world, it laps against the shores of Burundi's capital, Bujumbura.  Try your hand at traditional arts  A great way to get under the skin of Burundian culture is to explore its traditional arts and crafts at the Craftwares Village at Giheta. Leatherwork, ceramics, and woodcarvings are all for sale, while sculpture, wickerwork and painting can be practiced in the town's Art School.",africa,,
vatican city,"The Vatican City is the world's smallest sovereign state and is situated entirely within the city of Rome. Many visitors come for religious reasons, but you don’t have to be a Catholic to appreciate this extraordinary destination.      Famed sights include the colossal monument to Catholicism that is St Peter’s Basilica and the Vatican Palace, where the Pope resides. Inside his lavish abode lies the legendary Sistine Chapel, which lays claim to the most famous ceiling in the world. Crane your head to marvel at Michelangelo’s magnum opus, The Last Judgement.      Crowds can make a visit to Vatican City a bit of a trial – it’s busy throughout the year and at most times of day – but putting up with swathes of tourists seems like a small price to pay to bask in the state’s assorted treasures. Join the queues and follow the masses through the Vatican Museums to see an astonishing collection of paintings by the likes of Raphael and Giotto in the Pinacoteca Vaticana. You’ll also find extraordinary artefacts from classical antiquity, as well as museums dedicated to older finds from the Etruscans and Egyptians.      As leader of the Papal States for more than 1,000 years until Italian Unification in the 19th century, the Vatican has a long and uneven history. But the new Argentinian pope, formerly known as Jorge Mario Bergoglio, has breathed new life into the old office since his appointment in 2013. As a result, visitors from far and wide have been flocking in ever-greater numbers to catch a glimpse of the new Roman Catholic leader and the city he lives in.      Pope Francis is known to give a general audience on Wednesdays, either in Audience Hall or St Peter’s Square. On Sundays, he usually gives a midday blessing from the window of his office, which overlooks the square.",Vatican City  Attractions in Vatican City,europe,,
samoa,"Samoa offers visitors the chance to experience Polynesia at its most authentic. The capital, Apia, lies on the beautiful north coast of Upolu, the largest and most populous of the country's nine islands.  In the Aleipata district, waterfalls and white-sand beaches dominate the landscape. A 65km (40 mile) drive from Apia leads to the Falefa Falls, Mafa Pass and the Fuipisia Falls. Indeed, Samoa's natural attributes have an intoxicating effect on first-time visitors – islands' teeming jungles, mighty waterfalls and stunning sea have won many a tourist's heart. Thankfully, there are no colossal resorts to mar this landscape, while the locals are humble and welcoming. For the closest thing there is to earthly bliss, head to Savai'i, a veritable land before time, only a stone's throw from the relative civilisation of Apia.  The fa'a Samoa (the Samoan way) is arguably the most vibrant living culture in Polynesia, with a heritage that dates back 2,000 years. Only a small nation, Samoa is nevertheless the heart of Polynesia both culturally and, indeed, geographically. Compared to almost any other Pacific island, its hangs on staunchly to the traditional Polynesian way of life. Efforts by 19th-century missionaries sought to challenge the time-worn ways of the Samoans, to little effect. Ruled by both Germany and New Zealand in the 20th century, Samoa gained independence in 1962.  The Scottish poet and novelist, Robert Louis Stevenson, spent his final five years living on the island – his tomb on Mount Vaea is visible from the lawn of his house, now a museum. That Samoa must have influenced Stevenson's most famous book, Treasure Island, hardly needs saying. Samoa is as isolated as it is enticing, much-loved of the adventurous and with a rich, precious culture to boot. There are few destinations as unique as this one.","Samoa  Attractions in Samoa  Admire the beauty of the Aleipata region  Witness the most beautiful part of Samoa: the Aleipata district, which has a landscape dominated by waterfalls, white sandy beaches and traditional villages. From Apia, a 65km (40 mile) drive leads to the Falefa Falls, Fuipisia Falls and Mafa Pass.  Discover the rainforest  Discover some of Samoa's stretches of rainforest and conservation areas on an educational tour of Tanumapua, close to Apia. New species of wildlife are still being discovered including two new butterflies in 2009. Eco-tourism on the islands includes several ecological research programmes and eco-lodges.  Make a splash with surfing and diving  Go snorkelling and diving in the Palolo Deep Marine Reserve on Upolu island, which abounds with marine life. Looking for gnarly surf? Then you've come to the right place. Waves break on coral reefs around the islands, which makes for sick surfing (albeit only for experienced board riders). In some villages, surfing is not allowed on Sundays.  Marvel at Tia Seu Ancient Mound  Behold the largest ancient structure in the whole of Polynesia – the Tia Seu Ancient Mound is an awe-inspiring pyramid that stands at 12m (39ft) tall. Known to Samoans as The Pulemelei Mound, you can find it in the Letolo Plantation of the Palauli district in the eastern end of Savai'i Island.  Pay your respects to Robert Louis Stevenson  See the tomb of Scottish poet and novelist Robert Louis Stevenson, on top of Mount Vaea, from the lawn of his former home near Vailima. The house was restored and officially opened as the Robert Louis Stevenson Museum in 1994 on the 100th anniversary of his death.  See Samoa on the silver screen  See where Return to Paradise was filmed in 1952. The attractive Lefaga Village, on the southwest coast, can be reached by a cross-island road. Just off the coast of Upolu is Manono Island, which was the inspiration behind the WWII musical Tales of the South Pacific.  Soak up the beautiful beaches  Bask on the many beautiful beaches Samoa has to offer. Excellent freshwater swimming is possible at Falefa Falls, Fogaafu Falls, Papase'ea Sliding Rock (a rock slide down a waterfall into a deep freshwater pool) and Puila Cave Pool. Boats can be hired for net, spear, deep-sea and snorkel fishing.  Take a swim with a turtle  Visit the Auala Green Turtle Conservation, where guides show you turtles before they are released back into the wild. If you're lucky you could also get the chance to swim with these gentle giants under the supervision of guides. You can also find the turtles in their natural habitat in the sea around Nuutele Island.  Test yourself on the trails  Hike the dozens of routes on the islands, ranging from coastal walks to mountain treks. Trails tend to grow over rapidly and can sometimes be difficult to get through. Visitors should ask for local advice and permission before heading off, and pack plenty of provisions.  Wander around Upolu island  Chances are your first stop will be in Upolu, Samoa's most populous island. Its capital and main commercial centre, Apia, lies on the beautiful north coast. In 2009, the city was badly damaged by a tsunami with reminders of the disaster visible throughout the countryside. But the island is bouncing back and visitors will be smitten with beaches, coral reefs and tropical grandeur.  Watch the wildlife at Tafua Peninsula Rainforest Preserve  Watch for flying foxes and birds in the Tafua Peninsula Rainforest Preserve, near the coastal village of Tafua. The teeming forest is also one of the few habitats for the endangered and indigenous tooth-billed pigeon also called the Manumea, the national bird of Samoa.",oceania,,
comoros,"Not your typical tropical island getaway, Comoros may lay claim to sandy shores, limpid oceans and colourful coral reefs, but the archipelago’s greatest asset is its fascinating culture, which fuses together the most colourful elements of Africa and Arabia.      Floating between Mozambique and Madagascar, the archipelago has long been a crossroads between civilisations and most Comorians are of mixed Afro-Arab descent. A blend of Swahili and traditional Islamic influences pervade the islands giving them a calm and phlegmatic atmosphere that guarantees a hospitable welcome.      The four main islands that comprise sleepy Comoros do not share the tourist infrastructure of the Seychelles or Mauritius (with the exception of Mayotte), but they do share the warm seas, deserted beaches and stunning hiking that these destinations are renowned for.      Most travellers enter the country via the capital, Moroni, which nestles on the island of Grande Comore and hums with the atmosphere and traditional customs of a long-forgotten outpost. Men drink tea beneath whitewashed buildings in the Arab Quarter, as they have done for decades, while women in brightly coloured East African fabrics smile shyly from ornate doorways.      Also known as the Perfume Islands, the smell of vanilla, cloves and other spices is ever-present in Comoros, and locals are proud to produce more Ylang-Ylang essence for the perfume industry than anywhere else.      Leave fragrant Moroni behind and trek to the summit of Mount Karthala, also on Grande Comore. The archipelago’s highest peak, at just under 2,400m (7,800ft), this lofty vantage point happens to be one of the region’s most active volcanoes. The views are exquisite.      For a taste of France pay a visit to Mayotte, which, due to a quirk in colonial history is now governed from Paris. Arguably the most developed of the islands, it has a distinctly Gallic air, adding more depth to these already characterful islands.","Comoros  Attractions in Comoros  Climb Mount Karthala  If you're feeling energetic, climb to the top of Mount Karthala, the Comoros' highest point at 2,260m (7,750ft), and then descend into the crater of this still active volcano. The vast crater, which is 4km (2.5 miles) wide in places, is said to be the largest of any active volcano in the world.  Come face to face with turtles on Mohéli  Known for its undisturbed natural beauty and tranquillity, Mohéli is the smallest of the Comoros Islands. Home to the nation's first protected area, the Parc Marin de Mohéli, it is a favourite with nature lovers for its populations of green turtle, dolphins, whales and exotic birds.  Explore Nzwani’s Swahili architecture  Nzwani (Anjouan) Island is notable for its waterfalls and abundant vegetation. The main town of Mutsamudu is built in Swahili-Shirazi style, complete with 17th-century houses with carved doors, twisting alleyways, mosques and a citadel. The ancient capital of Domoni is also worth a visit. The best beaches are in the Bimbini area, while perfume distilleries are found at Bambao.  Go scuba-diving in crystalline waters  With limpid waters and pristine coral reefs, diving opportunities abound throughout the archipelago. The Trou du Prophète in Misamiouli on Ngazidja, Niumashuwa Bay on Mwali and Pamanzi off Mahore are particularly fine sites, often visited by grey reef sharks, barracuda and even manta rays.  Hike to Dziani Boundouni  Dziani Boundouni is a sulphurous crater-lake at the centre of sparsely populated Mohéli, which can be reached on day-walks from the island capital of Fomboni. Popular with birdwatchers, a hike here also throws up the chance of catching sight of rare mongoose lemurs in the nearby rainforests.  Hit the beach  There are many excellent beaches on the islands and Galawa Beach on Grande Comore has a diving school for those who get bored bathing. Other good beaches include Bouni, Chomoni (near a sheltered bay), Itsandra and the palm-fringed Planet Plage. Traditional canoe races are occasionally staged in the lagoon that surrounds Mahore, while visitors can watch dhows (Arab sail boats) being built on the beach at Fomboni.  Kick back in Mitsamiouli  A town in the north of Grande Comore, Mitsamiouli has a number of beaches of white sand popular with tourists, and the remains of a Royal Palace dating back to the era of the Sultans. The town is known both for its good diving facilities and for having the best Comoran dancers.  Stop off at the French island of Mahore (Mayotte)  This French-administered island is surrounded by coral reefs and has good beaches and excellent scuba-diving facilities. The town of Dzaoudzi contains some old fortifications worth visiting. Nature lovers will enjoy the forested island of Pamanzi, 5km (3 miles), as well as the waterfall at Sulu, which plunges straight into the sea.  Take in the laidback capital, Moroni  The national capital, Moroni, is situated on Ngazidja (Grande Comore). A charming town, it contains a few broad squares and modern government buildings as well as the old, narrow, winding streets and market place. There are numerous fine mosques including the Friday Mosque, the top of which offers attractive views over the town and ocean.  While away the day in Itsandra  This fishing village, 6km (4 miles) from Moroni on Grande Comore, has a fine beach and opportunities to see traditional dances performed by the local men. The town was once the ancient capital of the island, complete with royal tombs and a fortress built in the 17th century.",africa,,
gran canaria,"Often described as a “miniature continent,” Gran Canaria is home to a staggering diversity of landscapes; from sweeping sandy beaches and red-earthed pine forests to undulating mountains and dusty deserts.      Forming part of the Canary Islands – a Spanish archipelago floating off the coast of Western Sahara – the island has long been used as a shortcut to the sun for European holidaymakers. Cheap package deals and boozy British tourists have sullied its sunny image, but in recent years the island has been reinventing itself as a more salubrious destination. Led by the deluxe end of the market, Gran Canaria’s hotels and restaurants are experiencing something of a makeover, as the island ditches its tacky seventies aesthetic for one of retro chic and boho beau monde.      Located on a nautical crossroads between Europe, Africa and the Americas, Gran Canaria was an important trading post for many centuries and has long welcomed foreign influences, which are evident in everything from local cuisine to the island’s ubiquitous Latino beats.    With its year-round sunshine, most come to Gran Canaria to bathe on sweeping sandy beaches, top up on vitamin D and imbibe the island’s legendary nightlife. Others come armed with hiking boots and a desire to discover Gran Canaria’s glorious interior, which opens up to reveal some truly remarkable landscapes.      The interior remains largely crowd free. Forget sprawling resorts and pumping clubs, its all boutique hotels and bucolic retreats in rural Gran Canaria, where evening entertainment revolves around games of dominoes with locals and watching the sunset over neighbouring Tenerife.    There’s also the northern hinterland, which is characterised by verdant mountains, leafy gorges and quaint villages. These landscapes are an extraordinary contrast to the sandy south, where a seemingly vast desert belies the island’s diminutive size.      Whether you come to party, soak up the sun or hike through the hills, it’s hard not to be charmed by Gran Canaria. The island might be a mainstream destination, but it has the capacity to surprise and that lies at the heart of its appeal.","Gran Canaria  Attractions in Gran Canaria  Bask on Maspalomas Beach  Considered the most beautiful of all the beaches on the island, Maspalomas has fine white sand backed by vast, wind-sculpted dunes. At over 5.5km (3.5 miles) long, there's plenty of room even on the busiest days.  Discover the lost village of Cueva Pintada  Set within caves excavated into the cliffs of Galdár, Cueva Pintada is the remains of an aboriginal village discovered in 1987 that comprised some 50 houses. The caves contain wall paintings made by the island's earliest inhabitants as well as archaeological findings dating from the 6th to the 16th centuries. Walkways take you through reconstructed houses for a glimpse into their primitive lives.  Get wet at Aqualand  The biggest water park on the island, Aqualand in Maspalomas (www.aqualand.es/maspalomas) has a plethora of pools, water attractions and slides, some of which are white-knuckle affairs. On-site extras such as lockers and sun beds are costly. Look out for discount coupons being given out at the airport on arrival.  Go twitching at Palmitos Park  A botanical and zoological wonderland, Palmitos Park (www.palmitospark.es) has 200 different species of birds plus a butterfly house, an aquarium, an orchid house and extensive cactus gardens. There's also Primates Island, home to a community of white-handed gibbons, and don't miss the Meercats who are endlessly entertaining.  Go whale watching  Whales and dolphins can be seen all year round in the waters off the Canary Islands. Species that call at the archipelago include sperm whales, short finned pilot whales and bottlenose dolphins. Various operators offer whale watching tours. Boats leave from Puerto Rico.  Hike through dramatic landscapes  Gran Canaria's varied typography is a big draw for hikers – some say it's the best destination in Europe for ramblers. It certainly ticks all the boxes; the island has everything from deserts and mountains to coastal paths and valleys, with trails for all abilities. Gran Canaria's hiking paths also reveal bucolic villages, forests and fabulous flora.  Learn about the Cañari at Museo Canario  The Cañari, Gran Canaria's original inhabitants, are the sole stars of the Museo Canario in Las Palmas (www.elmuseocanario.com), which is dedicated entirely to understanding the lives of the island's original inhabitants. The museum comprises the most comprehensive archaeological collection in the Canary Islands. The most popular room is the anthropology collection, which has wall-to-wall skulls and the mummified remains of Cañari.  Nip down to Cocodrilos Park  Otherwise known as Crocodile Park, Cocodrilos Park Zoo (www.cocodriloparkzoo.com) this popular attraction is home to the biggest collection of crocodiles anywhere in Europe – over 300 of the snappy beasts call the park home. Virtually all the crocodiles have been rescued from illegal traders or from being kept in unsuitable conditions as pets. There's also a tiger, a large collection of birds and monkeys and tropical fish.  Quaff away at the quay in Puerto de Mogán  Nicknamed the 'Venice of Gran Canaria,' due to the canals that crisscross the town, this scenic harbour is home to gleaming yachts, a pretty beach and narrow, bougainvillea-draped alleyways that are lined with craft shops. Come nightfall, the quayside restaurants are the perfect place to enjoy a romantic seafood dinner.  Strut your stuff at Las Canteras Beach  Gran Canaria's answer to Ipanema and Bondi, Playa Las Canteras in Las Palmas is a golden beach lined with a multitude of bars, restaurants and shops. The favoured lunch venue for city workers and playground for surfers, sunbathers and posers, Las Canteras is the focal point of the city and the only urban beach in the Canaries.  Take a stroll around La Vegueta  While away an afternoon strolling around the 16th-century streets of La Vegueta, Las Palmas' charming old town. Sights include the 17th-century Palacio Regental, now the High Court of Law, and the Gothic Cathedral of Santa Ana. Join the locals for a coffee on the terrace of the charismatic Hotel Madrid before losing yourself in the alleyways of independent shops.  Take in a show at Alfredo Kraus Auditorium  Standing like a beacon of culture at the end of Las Canteras beach in Las Palmas, the Alfredo Kraus Auditorium (http://auditorioteatrolaspalmasgc.es) was designed by Oscar Tusquets, inaugurated by the Prince of Asturias (the newly crowned King of Spain) and dedicated to Alfredo Kraus, the Canary Island's most famous tenor. The iconic building is the venue for concerts ranging from classical through jazz to hip-hop.  Tee off at Anfi Tauro Golf Club  With its year-round sunshine, Gran Canaria provides 365 possible golfing days a year, which, unsurprisingly, make it a magnet for the Pringle sweater wearing set. There are seven excellent courses to choose from including the Anfi Tauro, par 72 championship course in Mogán. Designed by von Hagge, Smelek and Baril, the Arizona style course provides challenges and vistas in equally breathtaking measure.  Trek to Caldera de Bandama  The Caldera de Bandama, a 200m (660ft) deep volcanic crater, has an observation platform on its peak from which you can gaze down at the rich tapestry of endemic plants that cover its floor.

Wander around Viera y Clavijo Botanical Gardens  Located a short drive from Las Palmas, Viera y Clavijo Botanical Gardens has over 2,000 species of plants including 500 endemic to Gran Canaria. Free to enter, the park is a favourite with newlyweds for photos amongst the spurges and palm trees.

Watch the action at Sioux City  Built in 1971 Sioux City is a western film set, which is the scene of movie-inspired performances such as Duel Until Death, Bank Robbery, Town Square Hanging and Indian Rain Dance. If formation foot moves are your thing, you'll enjoy the late afternoon line dancing sessions. The park also features horse riding.",europe,spain,canary islands
mississippi,"Mississippi serves up a veritable feast of hearty food, outdoor adventure and fascinating history. Running deep like the Mississippi River, the state’s narrative has been shaped by American Indians, European traders and pioneer settlers, whose tales of triumph and toil litter the Natchez Trace Parkway, a fascinating heritage route between Natchez and Nashville.      Vicksburg also delivers a huge slice of history. A key battle ground during the American Civil War (1861-1865), the conflict is commemorated with memorials and monuments at the Vicksburg National Military Park. Meanwhile, the Mississippi Freedom Trail pays poignant tribute to the racial strife that erupted here during the 1960s, when the state was a major player in the Civil Rights movement.      The architecture is no less dramatic. From 19th-century antebellum plantations to the eccentric Ohr-O’Keefe Museum of Art, the state abounds with eye-catching design. But nothing beats Mississippi’s stunning landscapes, which have inspired a wealth of artistic talent, from William Faulkner and Eudora Welty to Elvis Presley and BB King. The arts scene still thrives, with indie film festivals, honky tonks and Pulitzer Prize-winning authors lending the state a creative vibe.      Outdoor enthusiasts are well catered for in Mississippi: its balmy climate and vast wilderness are ripe for adventure. Bike a section of the 4,800km (3,000-mile) Mississippi River Trail, which scythes through 10 states, cycle through the Appalachian foothills on the Tanglefoot Trail, or set up camp in one of the state’s six national forests.      Mississippi’s culinary offerings also deserve exploration. State specialities range from fresh-from-the-Gulf shrimp and Delta hot tamales to super-sweet slices of Mississippi mud pie.

st maarten,"Sun-lovers, water babies, sailors and divers alike will find St Maarten an alluring Caribbean getaway. This popular destination in the former Netherlands Antilles is lined with delicious coastline, on which to frolic, bake, or get active.      The most prominent physical feature in St Maarten is Mount Flagstaff, an extinct volcano, but the most important for visitors is the excellent beach that follows the south and west coasts; beach activities and shopping at duty-free centres firmly satisfy most tourists.      St Maarten is also popular with sailing enthusiasts and divers. The excellent diving conditions feature striking coral reefs located close to the shore. One of the most popular dive sites is the wreck of HMS Proselyte, a British man-of-war which sank in 1801. Body boarding is increasingly popular way of enjoying the gleaming waters and getting refreshed in the pouring sunshine.","St Maarten  Attractions in St Maarten  Cross over to Marigot  Tiptoe across the border (no passports are required) into French St Martin and visit the charming market town of Marigot. This is the main town and capital on the French side. Market days are every Wednesday and Saturday morning.  Get on your bike  Cycling and mountain biking can be enjoyed on the coastal road and along the trails around Paradise Peak. There are excellent views and peddling allows you to quietly approach roadside wildlife. There are numerous bike hire and bike tour operators available on the island.  Have a go at deep sea fishing  Arrange a deep sea fishing expedition, with half- and full-day charters available all year round. Game fish can be found lurking in the deeper waters around the island such as tuna, mahi mahi and wahoo.  What better way to catch you own dinner.  Make some waves and go sailing  The island is one of the Caribbean's leading sailing venues, rent anything from motorboats and yachts to canoes, or charter day trips and ""picnic sails"" to secluded bays and nearby uninhabited islands. Bareboat charters are also available, which means you can charter a fully equipped yacht without a professional skipper and crew.  Marvel at the Queen Wilhelmina Golden Jubilee Monument  Take a peek inside Philipsburg's nine shingled churches, and visit the Queen Wilhelmina Golden Jubilee Monument. Nearby is Fort Amsterdam, dating from the time of the earliest settlers. Located alongside is a breeding colony of Brown Pelican with over 60 nests.  Set sail for the St Maarten Heineken Regatta  Founded in 1980, this annual yacht race bears the apt slogan ""serious fun"". It's intended to represent both sides of the sailing community in the Caribbean – the racing and partying. Growing year on year, the event now attracts over 3,000 sailors from 32 nationalities.  Shop tax-free in Philipsburg  Enjoy the colonial atmosphere and duty-free shopping of St Maarten's principal town, Philipsburg, which is situated on a sandbar that separates Great Salt Pond, a salt marsh, from the ocean. The entire town consists of two streets, Voorstraat (Front Street) and Achterstraat (Back Street), and several short, narrow alleys.  Take a visit to the Border Monument  Travel inland to see the picturesque ruins of several plantation mansions, set in the wooded hills around Mount Flagstaff, and the Border Monument, which celebrates 300 years of cooperation between the French and the Dutch.

haiti,"Haiti is a country guaranteed to shock and awe. Tragedy-scarred but tenacious, this small Caribbean nation has great beauty and great need. Boasting verdant mountains, white sandy beaches and plenty of African spontaneity, Haiti might be financially poor, but it is rich in natural beauty, culturally affluent.      Sharing the island of Hispaniola with the Dominican Republic, Haiti has all the hallmarks of a classic Caribbean destination. And so it was, in the 1960s and 70s, when the wealthy flocked here to relax in the tropical climate, tread upon powdery beaches and explore vertiginous mountain ranges.      However, decades of political instability and a series of natural disasters devastated Haiti’s tourist industry, and saw the country go from the travel sections of newspapers straight to the front pages.      But, slowly, holidaymakers are returning. Led by the luxury end of the market, new hotels are opening all the time in Port au Prince, which is a sign of how the tide is finally turning. As well as new hotels, numerous tourism development projects are also underway.      Haiti’s unique selling proposition as a Caribbean destination is its history and culture. It has a vibrant arts scene, irresistible fusion cuisine and many talented musicians, who pack out bars and clubs with their unique brand of African, European and Caribbean beats.      However, travelling around Haiti is not always easy. The country’s infrastructure has not recovered from decades of instability and the devastating earthquake of 2010.      Political uncertainty endures, too; the United Nations’ Stabilization Force for Haiti – known by its French acronym MINUSTAH – is still here ten years after it was sent in to restore political order.      In the short term, then, the best option for those travelling to Haiti is to use the services of a known tour operator. This might not feel particularly adventurous, but it will take the hassle out of visiting a nation that is still finding its feet after years in the wilderness.","Haiti  Attractions in Haiti  Admire the architecture  With their elaborate latticework, vibrant Voodoo patterns and decorative wooden shutters, Haiti's characterful gingerbread houses are a faded reminder of more prosperous times. But they might also be a taste of the future – city planners are considering building more after seeing how resilient they were in the 2010 earthquake. A Haitian take on 19th century French holiday homes, visitors can find these magnificent properties scattered around Port au Prince.  Discover the many charms of Jacmel  With its faded colonial charm and excellent local handicrafts, the town of Jacmel is worthy of exploration. The residents' irrepressible creativity has found new expression along the Boulevard du Bord de Mer: the oceanfront has been festooned with colourful murals and mosaics executed by local artists. It's perfectly possible to do a day tour out of Port au Prince, seeing Jacmel's sights and leaving after lunch.  Escape the mainland  Secluded and staggeringly beautiful, the satellite island of Ile-a-Vache offers exquisite, crowd-free beaches and upmarket resorts for those who really want to escape. Transfers are available from the seaport of Les Cayes on mainland Haiti.  Explore Citadelle Laferriére  This UNESCO-listed fortress is the largest in the Americas and it's hard not to be awed by the grandiose structure, which sits atop a mountain so steep they call it the Bonnet l'Eveque (or bishop's hat). Below the citadel are the ruins of King Henri's palace, San Souci, designed as a Versailles of the Caribbean.  Have a night out in Pétionville  The hillside suburb of Pétionville in Port au Prince is chock full of bars, restaurants and galleries. This is the beating heart of the local nightlife, though visitors should be wary of street crime as well as open manhole covers.  Hike in National Parks  The national parks of La Visite and Parc Macaya offer bountiful hiking opportunities. It's difficult, but not impossible if you have a good guide, all the gear and five days to spare, to get to the top of Pic Macaya, Haiti's second highest mountain. Parc Macaya also has other, more do-able trails.  Hit the beach  Bathers are spoiled for choice in Haiti, which is surrounded by stunning beaches. However, for something truly special, visit the small coastal town of Port Salut, which has seemingly endless stretches of pure white sand and barely a soul in sight.  Imbibe Haitian art  Art is deeply engrained in Haitian culture, reflecting the country's African roots and European influences. Tragically, the art world suffered devastating losses in the 2010 earthquake, which destroyed galleries and museums across the country – some works will never been seen again. However, the brilliant Museum of Haitian Art has a fine collection of paintings and crafts, showcasing the talents of local artists.  Take in epic vistas  For spectacular views over Port au Prince, the gorgeous Gulf of Gonave and its white sandy beaches, head for the lofty suburb of Boutillier, high in the mountains. If you fancy hanging around, head to the restaurant at the top, which offers hearty fare and a feast for your eyes.  Unwind in Cap Haïtien  On Christmas Eve 1492, Christopher Columbus ran aground on the north coast of Hispaniola near the present-day city of Cap Haïtien. There are worse places to be marooned. Nestling at the foot of lush green mountains and surrounded by several fine beaches, Cap Haïtien has a more laidback air than the capital and features many fine, colonial-style buildings. A short drive away is the charming village of Milot.  Visit the Iron Market in Port au Prince  Built in France, the canopy of the Iron Market was made for a train station in Cairo. However, when that fell through it was redirected to Haiti in 1891 where it stood until the 2010 earthquake. After an ambitious restoration project the market reopened in 2013 and is home to some 900 hawkers who ply their trade in anything from fruit to souvenirs.  While away the day in Noailles  A village of artists in the suburb of Croix des Bouquets – half an hour northeast of Port au Prince – Noailles resounds with the banging of mallets and the clanging of chisels as whole streets of artisans transform sheet metal into intricate works of art.",caribbean,,
spain,"From riotous fiestas and sizzling cuisine to world-class museums and cutting-edge art galleries, there's a reason why Spain endures as one of the world's most popular destinations. Like the country's famous tapas, Spain itself is a tempting smorgasbord of bustling cities, scenic countryside and sunny islands, which visitors can nibble away at on repeat trips or consume in one giant feast. Either way, it is one appetising nation.      In spite of its myriad attractions, most come to Spain for sun, sand and self-indulgence, flocking to the likes of the Costa del Sol and Costa Brava, whiling away days on beaches and nights in clubs. An early pioneer of package holidays, Spain's leading resorts have long been geared up for the mass market – from the Balearics to the Canary Islands – but it's not all sprawling hotel complexes; quaint fishing villages, bijou retreats and secluded beaches abound if you’re looking to veer off the tourist trail.      Spain is much more than holidays in the sun, though. Away from the beach there's an extraordinary variety of things to do; from climbing snow-capped peaks in the Pyrénées to hiking the ancient pilgrimage route of St James's Way; from diving in the protected Medes Islands to stargazing in Tenerife. Alternatively, you could drop in on one of the country's many festivals (think Running of the Bulls, La Tomatina and the Baby Jumping Festival) which are madder than a box of frogs.      And then there are the cities; Madrid, Barcelona, Bilbao, Seville, Valencia, the list goes on. Each one of these vibrant metropolises has their own distinct flavour; the Dali architecture and sweeping beaches of Barcelona seem a long way from the wide boulevards and soaring skyscrapers of Madrid (though the Catalans may wish it was further).       But for all their disparities, these cities are bound by Spain's remarkable history and enviable cultural feats, which are proudly displayed in the country's museums, galleries and UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Suffice to say, its popularity shows no sign of waning.","Spain  Attractions in Spain  Alhambra: Prepared to be awestruck  The impressive palace-fortress of Alhambra is a supreme creation of Moorish Spain, featuring majestic Arabic gates, intricate carvings and patios – Spain's most significant Islamic architecture. Perched on the hilltop of Granada city, this UNESCO World Heritage Site is one of the most visited monuments in Spain.  Asturias: Hear the blast of bagpipes  The green valleys and picturesque fishing villages of this northern province don't feel like traditional Spain, and when you encounter the cider culture and bagpipes you'll wonder just how strong Celtic roots can be. Super seafood and hospitality redeem the regular rain showers.  Barcelona: Explore the Catalan capital  Immerse yourself in Barcelona, from the cramped alleyways of the Barri Gótic (Gothic quarter) to the 19th-century Eixample quarter where many Gaudi buildings lie. Stroll along La Rambla and onto old Barceloneta and the seafront. Sights include La Sagrada Familia (Holy Family), the Seu (old cathedral), the Episcopal Palace and the Palau de la Generalitat.   Bilbao: Savour the delights  Visit Frank Gehry's marvellous Guggenheim Museum, which has turned the main city of the Basque region into a top tourist destination. The museum is a masterpiece of 20th-century architecture. Bilbao's Old Town is extensive with a gothic cathedral and atmospheric shopping streets studded with gourmet pintxo bars.  Bullfight: Brave a bullfight or take a bull ring tour  The controversial tradition of bullfighting is still very much alive in Spain, especially so in Madrid. Most towns only hold bullfights during their annual spring or summer fiestas, but Madrid's Las Ventas Bullfighting Ring hold regular corridas. If an actual bullfight seems too much, Las Ventas also offer guided tours for those that wish to understand the history.  Camino de Santiago: Trek the pilgrim way  Known as The Way of St James, the pilgrimage route encompasses a number of different walking trails that lead to the St James Cathedral in Santiago de Compostela, Galicia in northwest Spain. This was originally a pilgrimage route, although it has become a recreational trail. The route is marked with a scallop shell, the symbol of St James.  Canary Islands: Discover the dazzling Garajonay National Park  Situated in the very centre of La Gomera in the Canary Islands, Garajonay National Park boasts stunning scenery set amongst rocky vistas. Measuring 3,984 hectares (9,845 acres), the area was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage list in 1986 in recognition of the its outstanding natural beauty. Well-marked trails make it a popular visit for outdoor enthusiasts.   Cádiz: Feast on Sanlucar prawns  With archaeological finds dating 3100 years, Cádiz has a wealth of well-preserved historical landmarks in the Old Town which is bordered by the sea on one side and the city walls on another. Visitors also like to spend some time on its breezy Atlantic beaches and enjoy world-famous Sanlúcar prawns. Beyond the city, the Cádiz province could take weeks of your time if you like to hike around the picturesque white villages inland.  Córdoba: Discover Moorish Spain  Discover Moorish Spain in the winding streets of Córdoba, the former seat of the 10th-century Caliphate. The Mezquita (Great Mosque) is a mystic wonder and World Heritage Site. Originally a pagan temple, then a Christian Church, before the Moors converted it into a mosque. Just outside the city, the ruins of Medina Azahara are similarly atmospheric.  Madrid: Be captivated by culture  Culture lovers should explore Spain's capital, Madrid. Museu del Prado is a must; it boasts one of Europe's finest collections of art. Also worthy of a visit is the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia, which focuses on modern art and houses Picasso's famous Guernica. Also, don't miss Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza, Madrid's Royal Palace, the atmosphere around Puerta del Sol and Madrid's historic square, the Plaza Mayor.

romania,"Romania has a rich cultural and natural diversity. Its dramatic mountain scenery includes the densely forested Carpathian Mountains, picturesque valleys and miles of fine white sandy beaches on the Black Sea Coast.      The first post of call for most travellers is the bustling capital, Bucharest, which was once known as ‘Little Paris’ due to its sophisticated charm. Crammed with grand architecture, fascinating museums and traditional restaurants, it’s well worth a few days exploration. So too are the resorts along the Black Sea Coast, which surprise many with their stunning sandy beaches and ocean panoramas.      Ultimately, though, Romania remains defined by its small, rural communities, many of which still depend on ancient agricultural practices. From the isolated villages clinging to the Carpathian Mountains to the Saxon towns of Transylvania, a tour of Romania’s backcountry will uncover traditional ways of life and a treasure chest of cultural gems.      It is, of course, practically illegal to talk about Transylvania without mentioning the legend of Dracula. The Romanians are all too well aware of the interest in Bram Stoker’s fictional vampire and the castle at Bran (supposedly the spot that inspired Stoker’s story) has been transformed into one of the country’s top tourist attractions.      Elsewhere the forests covering the Carpathian Mountains shelter some of Europe's last remaining brown bears, wolves and lynxes, while racoon dogs and rare muskrats gather around the rivers.      While Romania offers travellers the chance to immerse themselves in a defiantly traditional way of life, that isn’t to say the locals don’t appreciate their creature comforts. The natural spas scattered across the country purport to cure everything from rheumatism to heart disease, and make a luxurious finale to any Romanian adventure.","Romania  Attractions in Romania  Berca mud volcanoes  This awe-inspiring landscape of bubbling mud is like nothing else you'll see in Romania. Located near Buzau, the Mud Volcanoes have been designated a geological and botanical reserve and are fuelled by natural gas eruptions 3km (2 miles) below the surface. Some of the mud craters have reached more than 6m (20ft) in height, but are perfectly safe to view.  Biertan  See Transylvania's numerous Saxon fortified churches, including the Biertan Church, which stands on top of a hill overlooking the village of Biertan and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The village itself still preserves a large Saxon community and boasts some world-class examples of Saxon architecture from the medieval period.  Black Sea Coast  Allegedly the place where Jason and the Argonauts landed after finding the Golden Fleece, Romania's Black Sea Coast is fast becoming a tourism hotspot. It's dotted with small resort towns such as Eforie, Jupiter, Neptun, Saturn, Venus and Mangalia, where you can swim, try watersports or simply relax on the beach and soak up the sun.  Bran Castle  Let imagination run wild at Bran Castle, the legendary abode of the medieval king known as Vlad the Impaler, who helped inspire Bram Stoker's novel, Dracula (www.draculascastle.com).  Bucharest  This beautiful old capital was decimated by Nicolae Ceauşescu's programme of systemisation between the 1960s and 1990s, but the historic centre is still a bastion of old world charm. Wander around some of the most important streets in Bucharest: Calea Victoriei (Victory Road) which holds the The Vernescu House and Boulevards Gh. Magheru, Carol I, Calea Mosilor, Calea Dorobantilor and Soseaua Kiseleff.  Ceausescu's Palace of Parliament  In Bucharest, admire the colossal size and exceptional facilities of Ceausescu's Palace of Parliament, which rises out of the city like a giant wedding cake.

Constanta  Visit the Greek/Byzantine port of Constanta, founded in the sixth century BC and veer inland to interesting archaeological sites including the ancient Greek city ruins of Histria, Tomis and Callatis (www.constanta.ro). In the city itself, you'll find enough museums, ancient churches and historical monuments to satisfy even the most ardent culture vulture.  Cycle  The terrain in Romania is perfect for mountain biking, in fact there are numerous outfitters which cater specifically to cycling holidays. Trails range from novice to advanced, however most are geared towards cycling enthusiasts.  Fagaras mountain range  A magnet for walkers and adrenaline junkies, this superb mountain range has fourteen peaks over 2,500m (8,200 ft) and a succession of spectacular alpine lakes. If trekking or mountaineering sound like too much hard work, you can take in the scenery through a drive along the Transfagaras Road – Romania's highest asphalt road, and undoubtedly one of the most scenic routes in the country.  Maramures  Check out the traditional villages such as Budesti, Sirbi and Calinesti nestled in the picturesque rural idyll of Maramures (www.visitmaramures.ro). Nature lovers will love the volcanic mountains, waterfalls and glacier lakes around Creasta Cocosului reserve, while culture junkies can admire the UNESCO-designated wooden churches and the unique ‘Merry Cemetery’ at Sapanta.  Museum of History of the Jewish Community  Housed in an old Bucharest synagogue, this museum is dedicated to the history of Jews in Romania as well as in memory of the Holocaust. On display are artifacts such as a collection of books written and illustrated by Romanian Jews, important paintings, ritual objects as well as anti-Semitic propaganda.  Painted Monasteries  It's worth the trek to the Painted Monasteries of Bucovina (Voronet, Sucevita, Moldovita and Humor) in Northern Moldavia. These UNESCO World Heritage Sites are painted with frescoes both inside and outside and have been preserved in excellent condition since medieval times.   Pamper yourself  With its curative thermal springs, salt waters and healing mud, Lake Techirghiol is one of Romania's premier spa destinations. Bathing in the waters of the lake is said to heal everything from rheumatism and arthritis to peripheral nervous system diseases, and there is a huge range of spa treatments available in the nearby town.  Sibiu  Visit Sibiu (www.sibiu.ro), the chief city of the Transylvanian Saxons. Much of the four walls and 40 towers remain, and among its pretty blue, red, apricot and green painted houses are some of Romania's best museums. Don’t miss the Brukenthal National Museum (www.brukenthalmuseum.ro), which houses an impressive range of traditional and contemporary art.  Sighisoara  The exquisite medieval town of Sighisoara is a perfectly intact 15th century gem with nine towers, narrow passageways and cobbled streets, burgher houses and ornate churches. Sighisoara is also the birthplace of Vlad Draculea, nicknamed Vlad the Impaler. One of the best-preserved inhabited citadels in Europe, it's no surprise that the town has been designated by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site.  Snagov  This remote commune is a nature reservation and history buff’s paradise, with the main attraction being the Snagov Monastery (www.snagov.ro) – allegedly one of the burial sites of Vlad the Impaler. The monastery sits on an island in Snagov Lake and is linked to the village itself by bridge and boat.  Traditional entertainment  Catch some traditional folk music and dancing; shows can be seen in many hotels and restaurants.  Visit a market  The piatas or markets are farmers' markets where fresh produce can be bought. Pick up some home made cheeses and breads, find a scenic spot and have yourself a picnic afterwards.  Visit the Carpathian Mountains  TheThe Carpathian Mountains, a densely forested mountainous area, is ideal for hiking. In winter, resorts such as Poiana Brasov and Predeal offer some of the best skiing in Eastern Europe - or go bob-sleighing at Semenic and Sinaia. Recently, the mountains have also garnered a reputation among cyclists and there's a huge network of upland tracks to explore.  Wildlife on the Danube  Cruise along the Danube Delta, to see over 300 species of birds and foxes, otters, wildcats and boars in a vast expanse of watery wilderness. This is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and biosphere reservation and altogether 3,460 species of animal can be spotted here – not to mention 1,700 plant species.

grenada,"As far as paradise islands go, few come more beautiful than Grenada. A mountainous and volcanic landscape gives the country one of the loveliest environments in the Caribbean, with crater lakes, rainforests and coastal mangrove plantations giving way to white sand beaches, and brilliant blue waters filled with coral reefs. What's not to like?  Grenada is known as the Spice Island for good reason. Nutmeg, cloves, cinnamon, ginger and vanilla are just a few of the scented gems found here. When it comes to food, Grenadians like it particularly hot and spicy. Pepper pot is a favourite – meat cooked with lots of garlic, onions and, you guessed it, pepper. As well as fragrant spices, music is also an important part of life on Grenada, with the calypso tunes dancing over the island evoking Grenadians' African origins.  Many will, of course, be drawn to Grenada for its beaches. They are several dozen of them, immaculate and well-preserved, while digging a bit deeper will bring you to isolated coves where it'll be just you and the sea. Bring your snorkelling gear – there are plenty of colourful fish species to be glimpsed.  If there's only so much lounging on a beach you can tolerate, pick up one of the many nature trails running across the island that'll take you through wilderness brimming with wildlife. Expect to see rare birds in the rainforest and monkeys in the loftier terrain. You're also likely to cross one or two spice plantations, whose beguiling aromas are one of the trademarks of Grenada.  The capital, St George's, is a pretty city boasting one of the finest beaches in the Caribbean, Grand Anse. Meanwhile, day trips to neighbouring islands come highly recommended for those keen on sailing, diving and fishing. For unassailable tranquility, spend some time on the islet of Carriacou, whose simple, idyllic way of life is sure to charm. In fact, on the whole of Grenada, there are no colossal resorts, meaning peace, quiet and nature are largely the order of the day, along with a friendly and welcoming population.","Grenada  Attractions in Grenada  Admire the exhibits at Carriacou Museum  A good first stop would be to discover Grenada's history at the Carriacou Museum in Hillsborough, where there's an impressive collection of Amerindian artefacts and mementoes dating back to 18th century when the islands were occupied by the French and British.  Bask on the beach  With its swaying palms and white sandy shores, Grand Anse is one of Grenada's best beaches. Levera Bay and Morne Rouge are also stunning, but to bask away from the crowds head to the deserted beaches on the southern coast. Like surfing? Then take your board to Levera Bay, which has fine swells.  Bathe under the waterfalls  Grenada's most spectacular waterfalls are the 15m (50ft) Annandale Falls and Mount Carmel Waterfall, which cascades into clear pools below. You can swim in several of the islands' rainforest pools and lakes, many of which are formed by waterfalls, such as the Concord Falls.  Dazzle your senses on a spice tour  Fill your nostrils with sweet aromas on Spice Island, which is home to Gouyave Nutmeg Processing Station, the largest nutmeg processing factory on the island. The nearby Dougaldston Estate also offers heady aromas and spice trivia on their tours. If you like what you smell, pick up some samples as you exit through the gifts hop.  Enjoy a glass of Caribbean rum  Quaffing rum is a time-honoured tradition in the Caribbean, particularly on Grenada. Discover how rum is made on a guided tour of one of the island's main rum distilleries. At the Grenada Sugar Factory in St George, guided tours include a tasting and opportunity to purchase its rum products.  Go for a very fun run  Make sure you're on Grenada on a Saturday, to watch a fortnightly event known as hashing. Participants meet at a designated rum shop, run around the island following a trail of flour or paper, before returning to the rum shop to undo all the exercise.  Have a reef encounter while diving  Grand Anse beach is the starting point for diving trips to nearby reefs and islands. One of the best dive sites is Molinière Reef, which is about 5km (3 miles) from St George's. Carriacou, in the Grenadines, also offers excellent diving. Keen snorkellers should head to White Island Marine Park and Martin's Bay, close to Grand Anse.  Join in Carnival  August is carnival time on Grenada and everyone is welcome to join in. It's a riot of colour and fun, with lively street parties, street theatre, steel bands and calypso competitions that all go on well into the early hours of the morning.  Set sail for adventure  Yacht races and regattas are held throughout the year on Grenada. The Sailing Festival in February is the biggest and attracts yachtsmen from all over the world. The sailing regatta in Tyrell Bay on Carriacou is also popular. The Grenadine islands are a popular sailing destination.  Sign up for an ecology day out  See Grenada's oyster beds, reached along a trail from Tyrrel Bay, followed by a short boat ride to the middle of one of the most pristine ecosystems in the region: La Sagesse Nature Reserve, which is a protected bird sanctuary with rivers, mangroves and salt lakes.  Take a dip in the lucky springs  The River Sallee's boiling sulphur springs can be seen bubbling in a number of holes north of Lake Antoine, leaving orange and yellow hues on the surrounding landscape. They are of spiritual importance for various religious sects and a natural wishing well. Don't forget to throw in a coin before you leave.  Take a hike in Grand Etang  Grand Etang National Park and Forest Reserve contains numerous marked trails, with gentle half-hour walks or expeditions of several hours. The park contains a wealth of interesting flora and fauna, and there are spectacular flower displays depending on the season.",caribbean,,
malaysia,"With reefs and rainforests, mountains and minarets, skyscrapers and sampans, Malaysia certainly lives up to its slogan: “truly Asia.” One of the world’s great cultural melting pots, Malaysia is a nation where Chinese joss houses, Hindu temples and gold-domed mosques jostle for space with towering skyscrapers. The British once presided over this fascinating sampling platter of Asian culture, leaving behind a legacy of hill stations, polo fields and high tea.      In fact, Malaysia offers two countries for the price of one; Peninsular Malaysia, bordering Thailand at the southern end of the Malay Peninsula; and East Malaysia, the northern half of the island of Borneo, nuzzling up against Indonesia and Brunei. This opens up some spectacular opportunities for nation-hopping across Southeast Asia.      Malaysia’s supercharged capital, Kuala Lumpur, resembles a crystal garden that has grown miraculously in the jungle. Indeed, pockets of virgin rainforest still survive amongst the towering skyscrapers, multi-storey shopping malls and monorail tracks. If you do nothing else, devote a day to sampling KL’s street food; from Chinese noodles and Indian dosas (rice pancakes) to aromatic and spicy Malay curries and seafood.      Away from the cities, untamed nature awaits, in the form of jungles dripping with rare and exotic species and coral reefs thronged by turtles, sharks and tropical fish. Malaysia’s national parks and wildlife reserves are well-organised and well looked after, and you might be lucky enough to meet Malaysia’s most charismatic resident, the orang-utan (literally, “forest man”).      Then there are the islands; tropical resorts such as Langkawi, Tioman and the Perhentian Islands have become almost legendary for fans of swaying palms, sparkling sand and scuba diving on pristine reefs. Malaysia’s dive sites – particularly those reached on live-aboard safaris – rank amongst the best in the world.      Peninsular Malaysia is where people go for bustling cities and colonial history, but the states of Sabah and Sarawak on Borneo are the gateway to another world. Lush rainforests are inhabited by isolated indigenous tribes, whose traditional way of life is vanishing fast as the modern world encroaches; catch it now before they put up a parking lot.","Malaysia  Attractions in Malaysia  Chill out on the Perhentian Islands  The twin islands of Perhentian Besar and Perhentian Kecil, together known as Pulau Perhentian, are among the country's most beautiful islands. Despite spectacular diving on teeming coral reefs, pristine white beaches, crystal clear waters, the islands are still relatively unexploited, with a laid-back, backpacker vibe.  Climb the Petronas Towers  Looming over downtown Kuala Lumpur like twin rocket ships, the iconic Petronas Towers were the world's tallest buildings from 1998 to 2004. Soaring to 436m (1,453ft), the towers are linked by a glass walkway with a viewing deck on the 41st floor. At the base of the towers is the Kuala Lumpur Convention Centre and the swish Suria KLCC mall.  Discover Penang's temples and beaches  The third great colonial city of Malaysia after Kuala Lumpur and Malacca, Penang is famous for its fantastic food, terrific temples and sun-kissed beaches. Historic George Town, the island's capital, is dotted with atmospheric Chinese temples, but perhaps the grandest temple is Kek Lok Si, whose Buddhist pagoda rises above the rooftops.  Dive Malaysia’s coral reefs  Malaysia is a world famous destination for scuba diving, with reefs and sunken islands that attract plenty of megafauna, including schooling hammerheads and rare whale sharks. There are dive sites all over the country, but the finest lie around the islands of Sipadan and Layang Layang, offshore from Sabah in East Malaysia.  Ease into the rainforest in Taman Negara  Malaysia is covered in pristine jungles, but Taman Negara National Park offers the chance to get deep into the rainforest without having to cut a path through the lianas. Marked trails and boardwalks snake between the trees, offering the chance to spot monkeys, snakes, deer and tapir. Expert guides can be hired from the Wildlife Department at Kuala Tahan.  Eat the streets in Kuala Lumpur  The melting pot of Malaysia comes to life on the streets of Kuala Lumpur, where whole districts are given over to Chinese, Indian and Malay food. The street food here is simply spectacular, and a reason to travel to Malaysia all by itself. At the other end of the spectrum, the city's restaurants are some of the best in Asia.  Escape to the cool Cameron Highlands  To escape the heat of the lowlands, the British colonials retreated to the hills north of Kuala Lumpur founding tea plantation and hill resorts in the cool Cameron Highlands. Today, this is Malaysia's best-known hill station, with trekking and tea tasting as the main attractions.  Explore Malay culture and customs in Kota Bharu  Bordering Thailand on the east coast of Malaysia, Kota Bharu is alive with the culture and customs of the Malay Peninsula. The town is famous for its traditional kites and shadow puppets and eating at the Kota Bharu night market, one of Malaysia's great feasts. Festivals abound, including the Kite Festival in June and Puja Umur (the Sultan's birthday) in March/April.  Feel a different pace of life in Kuching  The capital of Sarawak is a bustling metropolis by the standards of the tribal villages inland, but a sleepy backwater compared to the cities of Peninsular Malaysia. Highlights include temples and mosques, quirky museums, amazing crafts and cultural traditions, colonial relics and animated markets.  Feel the sense of history in Malacca  The best place to re-live Malaysia's colonial past is its oldest city, Malacca, the one-time capital of Malay sultans and Portuguese, Dutch and British seafarers. A couple of hours south of Kuala Lumpur on the west coast, the city is famous for its Portuguese and Dutch colonial architecture, and its fascinating hybrid cuisine, which fuses Indian, Chinese and Malay influences.  Join pilgrims in the Batu Caves  Just 13km (8 miles) north of Kuala Lumpur, the remarkable Batu Caves are a series of dramatic limestone caverns, dripping with stalactites, revered as a Hindu shrine. Every year in January or February, millions of devotees parade through the chambers and perform ritual acts of self-mortification for the spectacular Thaipusam festival.  Paddle up the Batang Rejang  The mighty Batang Rejang river is the gateway to Borneo's tribal heartland. Visitors who come here in May and early June can visit the longhouse homes of the Iban tribe, which shelter generations of the same family, recalling traditions that date back thousands of years. The best places to arrange a local guide are the jungle outposts of Kapit and Belaga.  Roam the rainforest  Despite expanding deforestation, large areas of Malaysia are still covered in stunning rainforests. You don't have to go far in Malaysia to find a patch of jungle; Templar Park, just 22km (14 miles) north of Kuala Lumpur, is a well-preserved tract of primary rainforest, criss-crossed by jungle paths and dotted with swimming lagoons and waterfalls.  Say hello to an orang-utan  Offering the rare chance to see wild orang-utans in their natural habitat, the Sepilok Orangutan Rehabilitation Centre in Sandakan, Borneo, exists to rehabilitate orang-utans rescued from hunters and loggers. In fact, it has the world's largest population of these 'wild men of Borneo', numbering some 80 individuals.  See Malaysia’s magnificent mosques  Malaysia is studded with magnificent mosques, from the historic Jamek Masjid in Kuala Lumpur, to the grand blue expanse of the Masjid Negara. Malaysia's mosques come in all shapes and sizes; there are mosques covered in glass (Kuala Terengganu), mosques made from pink granite (Putrajaya), mosques made from timber (Malacca) and mosques floating on water (all over the country).  Stay in a Malaysian longhouse  A stay in a longhouse, the traditional tribal communal houses of Malaysian Borneo, is one of the definitive Malaysian experiences. These expansive wooden homes are really entire villages housed under one single roof, and visits and even overnight stays are possible in the company of a local guide. Longhouses are found along many of the rivers of Sarawak and Sabah.  Stroll the sands on Langkawi Island  Malaysia's premier resort island, Langkawi boasts white sand beaches, fringing coral reefs, swaying palms and superior shopping, thanks to the island's duty free status. In fact, there are 99 islands in the archipelago, ringed by spectacular beaches. Ferries and flights come here daily from the mainland and you can continue by boat to Satun in southern Thailand.  Summit Mount Kinabulu  Climbing Southeast Asia's highest peak is one of the highlights of a trip to East Malaysia. Located in Kinabalu National Park, the soaring granite dome of Mount Kinabulu reaches 4,094m (13,432ft), and the summit offers epic views over the island. Most people start the trek before dawn to catch sunrise at the summit, but you'll need a guide and permit.  Uncover centuries of history in Kuala Lumpur  A fascinating colonial history and rich cultural diversity make Kuala Lumpur one of Asia's most invigorating capitals. The old centre is dotted with grand colonial architecture and relics of the British colonial administration, and around the city are fascinating enclaves of Indian, Chinese and Malay culture, interspersed with space-age skyscrapers and shopping malls.  Walk in the canopy at the Forest Research Institute of Malaysia  Just a short train ride from central Kuala Lumpur, this scientific research centre offers peaceful walking trails, jungle swimming holes and a 200m-long (656ft) rainforest boardwalk, suspended high in the canopy. It's a fine retreat from the hubbub of the city, and the Zoo Negara and Batu Caves are close by.",asia,,
italy,"Travelling around Italy remains one of those rare experiences in life – like a perfect spring day or the power of first love – that can never be overrated. In few places do history, art, fashion, food and la dolce vita (“the good life”) intermingle so effortlessly. In Italy you'll find sunny isles, glacial lakes and fiery volcanoes, rolling vineyards and urban landscapes harbouring more UNESCO World Heritage sites than any other country on Earth. Few places offer such variety and few visitors leave without a fervent desire to return.      The artistic and architectural treasures of Rome, Venice, Florence and Naples draw visitors to them like moths to a flame. Not content with Romans conquering most of the known world, the Venetians dispatched Marco Polo to uncharted lands off the map, while Giotto, Leonardo da Vinci, Brunelleschi and Michelangelo kick-started the Renaissance in Western art and architecture.      Look around at all the splendid palaces, paintings, churches and monuments and wonder at the centuries of hard graft and the unswerving devotion to traditional techniques. Like the local art, wine is also designed to elevate your spirits. From the neatly-banded stone terraces of the Cinque Terre, which snake from sea level to terrifying precipices, to the blousy hillsides of Chianti, the riverine plain of the Po valley and the volcanic slopes of Etna, Italian wines are lovingly made to complement the carefully-sourced regional cuisine on your plate.      Much like its food, this country is an endless feast of experiences. No matter how much you gorge yourself, you’ll always feel as though you're still on the first course. Do you go skiing in the Dolomites, or cycling in wine country? Do you dive the sun-split waters of Sardinia, climb Aeolian volcanoes or stalk market stalls in Naples? The choice is dazzling and bewildering. So take the advice of the locals. Slow down, sit back, tuck in that napkin and get ready to begin.","Italy  Attractions in Italy  Be inspired by the scenic Cinque Terre  WB Yeats, Ezra Pound, Byron and Shelley all garnered inspiration from Italy’s picturesque Riviera. Hardly surprising considering the dramatic curving bay and pine-covered mountains banded with vineyards and olive groves. Get a taste of the high life in the pastel-hued villas of Portofino, Rapallo, Portovenere and Lerici.  Bring out the binoculars and go wildlife watching  In the National Park of Abruzzo, you might spot Marsican brown bears (unique to Italy), chamois and eagles. In the Molise region, the Matese mountain range is still a haven for wolves, while bird-watchers should head to Sardinia during the autumn migration to spot Eleonora’s falcons and the rare cirl bunting.  Coo at culture on the canals of Venice  With marble palaces afloat on teal-blue waters, garden islands yielding speciality produce and golden glimpses of heaven in St Mark’s Basilica, Venice is a work of art in itself. Drift down the world’s most beautiful boulevard, the Grand Canal, and see where Casanova was imprisoned in the Doge’s Palace.  Dare to visit Europe's most active volcano  Offering skiing in the winter and hiking in summer, Mt Etna is Sicily’s most famous natural attraction. A UNESCO World Heritage Site and active volcano, it is also the highest mountain on the island currently measuring 3,350m (10,990ft) – the height varies with each eruption. According to Ancient Greek mythology, Cyclops forged Zeus’ lightning bolts deep within the sweltering centre of the volcano.  Delve into Ravenna's wealth of UNESCO sites  Discover early Byzantine and Christian monuments decorated with stunning mosaics in Ravenna, including the splendid Mausoleum of Galla Placidia, the golden flourishes of Basilica di San Vitale and the serene Neonian Baptistery. A trove of religious art and culture, the city boasts eight UNESCO World Heritage Sites.  Discover the delights of Padua  Home to Italy’s second oldest museum and a bastion of free-thinking, Padua harbours unique treasures. Almost 200 years before Michelangelo’s Sistine Chapel came Giotto’s groundbreaking frescoes in the Scrovegni Chapel. Copernicus and Galileo taught at the University’s Palazzo Bo and pilgrims still seek miracle cures at St Anthony’s tomb in the Basilica.  Explore the glorious Greek sites of Sicily  Hot, dry and wracked by earthquake and eruption, Sicily has been on the tourist trail since Goethe wrote home about Agrigento's Valle dei Templi in 1786. Part of Greater Greece for over 500 years, Sicily's sites outshine many in Greece. The catacombs at the Capuchin Monastery contain thousands of mummified bodies and classical Greek plays are still performed in Syracuse's Greek Theatre.  Explore the religious riches of Vatican City  Enter the Vatican City, an independent sovereign state best known for the magnificent St Peter's Basilica. Among the principal features of the Vatican Palace (the Pope's residence) are the Sistine Chapel – featuring Michelangelo's famous fresco, The Creation of Adam, and the Vatican Museums.  Hike, climb and ski picture-perfect peaks  In the Valle d'Aosta region, go hill walking or climbing in the Gran Paradiso National Park and Mont Avic Regional Park, home to wildlife including the chamois and ibex. On the Swiss border, the flower-cloaked slopes of the Dolomites are also ideal for hiking and mountaineering. In winter, heavy snowfall, chic hotels and Michelin-starred restaurants attract a stylish ski crowd.  Learn about geometry at the Leaning Tower of Pisa  Constructed in 1174, the Leaning Tower of Pisa, located in Pisa's Campo dei Miracoli (Field of Miracles) is famous both for its striking beauty and awkward geometry. Today, one side is 5m (16ft) closer to the ground than the other. Galileo used the tower for experiments to prove his theory of motion when he was chair of mathematics at the town’s university.  Live a life of luxury among the Italian Lakes  Basking in a Mediterranean microclimate, the Italian Lakes have been a popular holiday spot since Roman times. The Borromean princes built their palaces on islands in the middle of Lake Maggiore, while modern-day movie stars and Russian billionaires now seek shelter in art deco villas amid Lake Como’s blooming tropical gardens.  Look for love in Verona  Soak up the romantic sights of Verona, the setting of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. The Casa di Giulietta (Juliet's House) attracts thousands of visitors to its balcony each year, whilst the vast Roman Arena, built in the 1st century, is the site of an annual opera festival.  Look under the carpet at Siena cathedral  Admire Siena's extraordinary humbug-striped cathedra (Duomo). With a grand, upper façade mosaic, peeping gargoyles and large bronze door, there is plenty to attract the eye from the outside. Inside though, the fine blue and gold interior adds to the grandeur. Go in September to see its intricate patterned floor (pavimento) which remains covered most of the year.  Revel in the beauty of Florence  Visit Florence and see Brunelleschi's revolutionary design for the magnificent cathedral (Duomo).  Cross the medieval Ponte Vecchio bridge, see the art collections of the Uffizi Gallery and Michelangelo's famous statue of David at the Galleria dell'Accademia, all among the city’s beautiful Renaissance architecture.  Sail around spectacular Sardinia  With its turquoise coastline, spectacular grottoes and coral-rich seas, Sardinia is a diver’s paradise. Above sea level, winds blow along the northern and southern coasts, attracting wind and kite surfers to Santa Teresa di Gallura and Chiaia, while sailors cast off beneath the granite cliffs of the Golfo di Orosei.  Take to the coast for watersports  From water skiing to windsurfing, head to the coast where all types of watersports are available. Popular spots include the Italian Riviera in Liguria, the Adriatic and Amalfi coasts. Less busy are the beaches in Sicily, which has large sandy stretches on the southern coast, and in Sardinia. Many of Italy's best dive sites are located in Sardinia.  Tour the Tuscan wine cellars  Typically, the landscape of Tuscany is one of vine-covered hills, cypress woods, fields of sunflowers and remote hilltop villages. Chianti, the best-known Italian wine, is made in the area north of Siena. With several vineyards open to the public, wine fans should drink their way around a Tuscan tasting tour.   Tour the ancient heart of Rome  With its epic history and monumental museums, Rome is the repository of over 2,500 years of European art and architecture. Start at the beginning with the Colosseum, the Forum, the Pantheon and the Capitoline Museums. Then get intimate in the reconstructed bedrooms (cubicula) of Museo Nazionale Romano.  Walk through the remains of Pompeii  Understand how 1st-century Romans lived their daily lives when you see the remains of Pompeii and Herculaneum, engulfed in the great eruption of 79 CE. Wander the narrow streets of these well-preserved archaeological sites to see their amphitheatres, their forums and plenty of striking colourful mosaics. In Pompeii, plaster casts have been made of the doomed resident's remains.",europe,,
hungary,"Culturally and linguistically distinct from all of its immediate neighbours, Hungary is very much the ‘odd one out’ in Central Europe, but for all the most honourable reasons.      This is a nation whose capital, Budapest, can hold up a mirror to classical Vienna; it’s a world of well-preserved castles, seductively good wines and quiet stoic pride; a landscape of low-lying mountains, oak forests and thermal springs.      The Romans were the first to make use of the hot waters, originally for medicinal purposes. Today, the pursuit is relaxation and over time the bathhouses have grown into splendid architectural affairs, most notably in Budapest.      The capital is an elegant, stylish and lively city made up of two separate settlements clustered on either side of the Danube River: hilly Buda has a wealth of graceful Habsburg and neoclassical buildings, while sprawling Pest is its commercial centre with a generous scattering of art nouveau architecture and an ad-hoc party scene.      The city has long been the focus of Hungary’s artistic, musical and literary community and is by far the best place in the country for a choice of bars, restaurants and nightclubs.      Smaller cities are equally architecturally fascinating and deserving of a visit in their own right: Pécs for its museums; Eger for it’s fortifications and infamous Bull’s Blood Wine; and Györ whose grand Basilica houses the golden herm of László.      Beyond these urban centres, Hungary’s bathes in natural delights. South west of Budapest is Lake Balaton, Central Europe’s largest body of freshwater, where locals spend hot summers cooling off in waters that average 20°C (68°F).      In winter, Hungary freezes, and thrill seekers head north to the Bakony Hills for the chance to ski through the forests before unwinding with a dip in the thermal spa.      It may be landlocked, but Hungary is a country content on ploughing its own furrow no matter what seeds its neighbours are sewing and is all the better for it.","Hungary  Attractions in Hungary  Brace yourself for brandy at Kecskemét  En route to Szeged from Budapest, Kecskemét is an attractive town with several museums and a fine selection of art nouveau architecture. At the centre of Hungary's fruit growing region, the town is renowned for its many varieties of pálinka (fruit brandy). ""In small amounts a medicine, in large amounts a remedy,"" the locals tend to slur.  Discover both halves of the capital  Explore Buda's elevated cobbled streets and take in the spectacular view of the Danube from the Fisherman's Bastion. In Pest, admire the Hungarian Parliament and Museum of Applied Arts, or unearth the treasures at the Hungarian National Museum. Fans of Socialist-era statuary should take a trip out to the suburbs to visit Memento Statue Park.  Explore a former European Capital of Culture, Pécs  Pécs, the fifth largest city in the country, is also home to one of the oldest universities in Europe and has many fine examples of architecture from the Ottoman period, most notably the 16th-century mosque of Gázi Kászim Pasha. The UNESCO World Heritage-listed Early Christian Necropolis is also located here, alongside many fine examples of Habsburg period buildings.  Explore the architecture of Eger  Pay a visit to Eger in northern Hungary, one of the country's oldest and most colourful cities, which boasts around 200 historical monuments that include a castle, a 14-sided Ottoman minaret and a classically-finished basilica, complete with outstanding frecos, domed ceiling and mighty columned entrance.  Find fine fishing at the River Tisza  Fish in the River Tisza, regarded as one of Europe's premier angling spots. At points, wide and wild, it can seem like you have the whole river to yourself.  Accommodation for anglers is readily available, and guides can be hired if required. Species such as carp, bream, pike, trout and tench are abundant.  Get to know glorious Györ  In the northwest of Hungary, close to the Slovakian and Austrian borders, Györ has cobbled pedestrian shopping streets and an attractive baroque city centre. Just an hour and a half by train from Budapest, the city makes for a pleasant day trip from the capital.  Hark back to Hungary's rural heritage at Hollókő  Travel back in time at Hollókő, a UNESCO World Heritage-listed ethnographic village. Spread over 145 hectares (358 acres), the settlement has been deliberately preserved as an example of life before the agricultural revolution. Northeast of Budapest, there is around 60 wattle and daub houses and the substantial remnants of a 13th-century castle.  Hike the heights of Hungary  Go hiking in Hungary's mountainous northeast region. The Zemplén, Bükk and Mátra ranges northeast of Budapest are popular for their stunning verdant landscapes, with the latter containing Hungary's highest peak, Kékes (1,014m/3,327ft). For easier terrain, head to the hills north and south of Lake Balaton.  Keep your hawk's eye peeled at Hortobágy National Park  Go birdwatching in Hortobágy National Park, a vast area of grassland in eastern Hungary. Designated a World Heritage Site in 1999, around 350 species have been spotted here, including storks, warblers, eagles, herons and rare great bustards. Motorised vehicles are not allowed in some parts of the park, while other parts require a guide.  Luxuriate in Budapest's beautiful baths  Relax at one of Budapest's thermal springs and medicinal baths, of which there are over 100 in the city. The elegant Gellért Baths, with a domed hall and frescoed ceilings, are the most famous. Other good options include the Király Medicinal Baths, which date from the Middle Ages; the historic Rudas Medicinal Baths; and Széchenyi Baths' splendid outdoor pools.  Ride the Great Plain on horseback  Take to the saddle and explore the Great Hungarian Plain. Head to Puszta, home to several stud farms and the infamous ""Putszta Five"" technique, where a single rider stands to gallop five horses simultaneously. Excursions along horse riding trails can be arranged through riding schools all over the country. Worry not: saddles are included.  Seek out Szeged for a spot of sunshine  Visit Hungary's sunniest city is the lively university town of Szeged. Straddling the Tisza River, this cultured city is home to many fine churches and a pleasant, pedestrianised cafe culture. Each summer, below the twin-towered Dóm tér, its main square transforms into a large open-air theatre.  Sink your teeth into Sopron  Head west to the delightful medieval cities of Sopron and Kőszeg. Sopron boasts 240 listed buildings, including the 12th-century Firewatch Tower, Storno House and the Gothic Goat Church, while Kőszeg's Jurisics tér contains a treasure-trove of baroque, renaissance and Gothic architecture. With over 300 clinics, Sopron is also the self-proclaimed 'dental capital of the world'.  Sip Hungary’s famous Bull's Blood wine  Spend time exploring the Szépasszony Valley vineyards, one of the country's numerous wine regions, where Hungary's famous Bikavér (Bull's Blood) wine can be sampled. Some of the country's very best reds can be found around Villány in the far south, whilst Miskolc in the northeast (part of the Tokaj region) is famous for its distinctive dessert wines.  Soak yourself healthy in Hévíz thermal lake  Soak away the stress in the large thermal lake at Hévíz near Lake Balaton. The soothing waters, which rarely drop below 23°C (73°F) in winter and 33°C (91°F) in summer, will certainly leave you feeling refreshed – some even consider them to have health-giving properties.  Stay outside for culture at Sóstói Open-Air Museum  Get a taste of the rural Hungary of old at the Open-Air Museum at Sóstói, a suburb of the city of Nyíregyháza in eastern Hungary. The architecture here preserves the rural traditions and culture of the region and the museum also holds several festivals each summer.  Take a beach break at Lake Balaton  Lake Balaton in Hungary's Transdanubian region is Central Europe's largest freshwater lake. Visit one of the resorts that surround the shores such as Siófok, popular with the young for its beaches and nightlife; or the more sedate market town of Keszthely, with its elegant Festetics Palace. Lake Balaton also has plentiful sandy beaches that bustle in summer.  Travel around the Danube Bend  Visit the historic towns along the Danube Bend. Szentendre is famous for its south European atmosphere, large artists' colony and numerous museums. Visegrád has a small castle and the remains of an early Renaissance palace. Esztergom is home to the impressive Basilica of the Blessed Virgin Mary Assumed Into Heaven and St Adalbert, Hungary's tallest building.",europe,,
belgium,"The “boring” tag is laughable – Belgium, pretty and creative, is one of Europe’s most underrated travel destinations. Beer, chocolate and moules-frites might be the starting points for many first-time visitors, but while you’ll eat and drink well, the country’s other selling points are no less weighty.      Medieval cities like Brussels, Bruges, Antwerp and Ghent play home to some stunning architecture, while a military legacy that covers everything from Waterloo to WWII holds its own interest. It’s compact, easy to travel around and boasts no fewer than 60 UNESCO World Heritage Sites. On top of that it hosts riotous festivals like they’re going out of fashion and has a world-class arts heritage, to boot.      What Belgium isn’t, however, is straightforward. Divided into three regions − Flanders (the predominantly Dutch-speaking north), Wallonia (the predominantly French-speaking south) and the capital region of Brussels – it’s still very much split down linguistic lines. Even Belgians themselves will often refer to their homeland as an “artificial country.” In many ways, this only makes the place more fascinating.      Flanders is filled with museums and medieval architecture, its countryside studded with white-washed hamlets and paved with miles and miles of cycling paths. Its North Sea coastline offers opportunities to try land boarding or kitesurfing. Wallonia, meanwhile, follows a slower pace. Steeped in folklore, its main towns have a faded French elegance and are ideal jumping-off points for exploring the rolling hills of the Ardennes. In both halves of the country, there are some genuinely beautiful landscapes.      Brussels itself is a blend of Art Nouveau mansions and gleaming skyscrapers, art galleries and flea markets, “fritkot” chip stands and Michelin-starred restaurants. Made up of 19 communes − from the chic Ixelles district to up-and-coming Anderlecht − it’s a city with many faces. Each quarter offers a different take on the personality of “Europe’s capital,” which is apt in itself: in Belgium, very little matches the monochrome preconception.","Belgium  Attractions in Belgium  Antwerp  Flanders' 'second capital' is the most dynamic of the northern cities. Famed for its diamond processing, the city is also home to the second-largest harbour in Europe and exposure to numerous nationalities has made it cultured and open-minded. Visit one of the world's oldest zoos, a one-of-a-kind collection of Antwerp-resident Peter Paul Rubens' masterpiece paintings, and shop 'til you drop along the Meir.  Battle of the Bulge  One of the deadliest surprise attacks launched by German forces against Allied troops during WW II, the Battle of the Bulge took place close to the Luxembourg border and is a key site of remembrance. The nearby Bastogne Historical Centre has a strong collection of memorabilia.  Brussels  Belgium’s capital is compact, but boasts myriad personalities thanks to its hotch-potch mix Eurocrats, locals and immigrant Congolese, Turkish and Moroccan neighbourhoods. From the UNESCO-listed Grand’ Place and cheeky Mannaken- Pis peeing statue, to the gleaming EU buildings and hip Ixelles district there’s always plenty to explore. Keep and eye out for Belgium’s famous begijnhofs − pious communities founded in the 13th century as sanctuaries for the many women left widowed by the Crusades.  Castles in Wallonia  It's said that Belgium has a higher density of castles per square mile than anywhere else. The castles themselves, which range from manor houses to mighty fortresses, are found across the entire country, but it's in Wallonia that the most attractive constructions are found.  Eat moules frites  No trip to Belgium would be complete without sampling moules frites (mussels with chips/ French fries). A summer speciality, often served with a light mustard dipping sauce, these plump seashells are best when washed down with a refreshing white beer such as Hoegaarden.  Enjoy the original Spa  The Wallonian town of Spa is the place from which all spas take their name and, as such, makes for an essential stop-off for those who enjoy a spot of pampering. The modern hilltop spa (www.thermesdespa.com) offers a range of different treatments, while the 19th-century-style town is attractive in its own right.  Explore Bruges’ canals  As the best-preserved medieval city in Europe, UNESCO-listed Bruges is a must-see. Early traders weaved their way through its many canals and it's still the best way to see the city and its legendary historical sights. Numerous canal-boat operators line the banks.  Get lacy  Belgian lace is one of the country's most famous products, with its production dating back to the Renaissance. Bruges and Brussels have a handful of shops selling high quality and antique lace, while the Kantcentrum (www.kantcentrum.eu) in Bruges gives regular demonstrations.  Ghent  Billed as ‘Bruges without the tourists,’ Ghent boasts almost as many waterways and historic buildings, as well as the ‘buzz’ provided by its university students. Must-sees are the 15th-century painting The Adoration of the Mystic Lamb in Sint-Baafskathedraal, the Graslei canal, and the foreboding city-centre medieval Gravensteen castle.  Have a few beers  Belgium's brewing history reaches back to the Middle Ages, so it would be downright rude not to sample some of its famous ales. There are still well over 100 breweries in the country, producing everything from pale lager to hefty Trappist ales. Bartenders are always happy to talk you through the 800-plus options!  Indulge in chocolate  Visitors with a sweet tooth will already be well aware of Belgium's lip-smacking prowess when it comes to chocolate. Famed for their freshness, you can pick up affordable boxes from the likes of Leonidas and Neuhaus, or splash out of boutique chocolatier Pierre Marcolini. Brussels (www.mucc.be) and Bruges (www.choco-story.be) both have chocolate museums.  Join the carnival  Belgium has a colourful annual roster of festivals and celebrations, from the UNESCO-listed Binche carnival (www.carnavaldebinche.be) in Wallonia and Bruges’ Heilig-Bloedprocessie (www.holyblood.com) in Flanders, to Brussels’ 500-year-old Ommegang pageant (www.ommegang.be).  La Roche-en-Ardenne  Take to the rivers on kayak, try spelunking, or enjoy a gentle cycle amid the hills of the Ardenne's best base for outdoor activities. An idyllic spot ideal for young families.  Learn about diamonds  Antwerp has long enjoyed a sparkling reputation as the world's diamond centre, and visitors can discover the city's prominence at the Diamant Museum (www.diamantmuseum.be). The venue features gem cutters and polishers at work, as well as outlining 400 years of history.  Liège  Built on the back of the steel industry, Liège's charm is perhaps better hidden than other Belgian towns. Those that dig a little deeper, will come across some charming historic quarters and heritage buildings. It has a bohemian spirit and a strong association with folklore - look out for the mischievous character of Tchantchès in the Outremeuse district. Great as a day-trip from Brussels.  Ostend  Once the playground of European aristocracy, the city, beaches and promenade of Ostend possess a faded elegance of days gone by. Visit the restored Mercator Navy ship and dine on fresh shrimp at the daily fish markets.  Take in a museum  From Brussels’ Musées Royaux des Beaux-Arts − the best-stocked art gallery in Europe − to the hyper-modern Musée Hergé celebrating all things Tintin in Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium is brimming with first-rate museums.  Waterloo  In June 1815, in a muddy field 18km (11 miles) south of Brussels, French Emperor Napoleon went head to head with England's Duke of Wellington and lost. Known as the Battle of Waterloo, this pivotal fight ended 22 years of war and brought peace to Europe. Visits to the historic site are possible, with trains travelling out from Bruxelles-Midi/Brussel-Zuid. Car hire is also popular.",europe,,
yemen,"If it were an authentic taste of Arabia that you're craving, Yemen was long the answer. An antidote to Arabian Gulf bling, this was long the peninsula's most fascinating destination.  The largest city in Yemen, Sana'a is where most visits start. The Old City is UNESCO listed, its multi-storey tower houses and ancient Souk Al Milh lending an overwhelming medieval atmosphere. Being woken pre-dawn by competing muezzins from the city's fortyish mosques is a truly remarkable, unforgettable experience.  Outside the capital, explore fortified cliff-top villages overseeing cultivated plains or hike the foothills of the Haraz Mountains. To the east, walk the shady streets of Shibam, Freya Stark's 'Manhattan of the Desert', where nine-floor mud towers stand testament to Yemeni building skills. On the coast, visit the bustling fishing ports of Al Mukalla or Al Huydaydah. Most remote is Yemen's 'Arabian Galapagos', the Socotra archipelago. Cast adrift at the mouth of the Gulf of Aden, Socotra is two hours by air from Sana'a; 37% of plant species, 90% of reptiles and an estimated 90% of invertebrates here are found nowhere else on earth.  Once characterised as Arabia Felix (Fortunate Arabia) by the Romans and known as the land of milk and honey by Noah's sons, these days an uncertain security profile deters all but the hardiest travellers from visiting Yemen. In 2011, Arab Spring protests led to a revolution aimed at improving economic conditions and ending corruption. Unfortunately, the aftermath of the protests has been ever-increasing violence between different rebel factions and jihadists.  When Yemen eventually recovers from this civil war, tourists will surely be drawn back to the land that the Queen of Sheba called home, and where Gilgamesh came in search of the key to eternal life. A country with such a rich history and culture, Yemen certainly deserves more than the present-day tragedy inflicted upon it.","Yemen  Attractions in Yemen  Aden  Visit the port of Aden with its biblical history and fine museums. Crater, the oldest part of the city, lies in the crater of an extinct volcano and is where the most ancient constructions in Aden may be seen.  Al Hudaydah  Colourful wooden fishing boats skippered by crews from Yemen, Eritrea and Djibouti fill the harbour of this Red Sea fishing port.  A visit to the fragrant and thronging and fish market sees myriad species including shark, swordfish and tuna auctioned fresh off the boat to the highest bidder.  Amran  See Amran, lying on the edge of the fertile basin of al-Bawn. The city is surrounded by the old clay city walls of pre-Islamic, Sabean origin.  Bab al-Yemen Market  Shop for souvenirs in Sana'a's 1,000-year-old Bab al-Yemen Market, which is divided into 40 different crafts and trades. The spice market is one of the best to visit. Other markets include the Souk al-Nahaas selling embroidered head-dresses, belts and jambias (curved daggers).  Dive  Dive in the balmy Red and Arabian seas, or take to the water for a spot of sailing.  Great Mosque of Sana'a  See the Great Mosque of Sana'a, the oldest and largest of the mosques in Sana'a and one of the oldest in the Muslim world, constructed in the lifetime of the Prophet and enlarged in AD705.  Hadda Mountain  Scale Hadda Mountain and take in picturesque villages dotted with orchards growing apricots, peaches, walnuts and almonds.  Haraz Mountains  These central mountains provide one Yemen's best trekking areas.  Guided hikes maybe arranged to take in the larger villages of Manakha, Al Hajjarah and Huytayb along with those barely-visited lost in the Haraz uplands.  Hodeida  Visit the modern Red Sea port of Hodeida and see the fish market, where fishing boats have been built from wood in the same way for hundreds of years.  Little Aden  Lounge on several superb beaches fringing the Indian Ocean at Little Aden, situated in the crater of an extinct volcano; this is an area of small fishing villages in sheltered bays. Hike and camp on Socotra Island; the island's remarkable landscape is home to a huge array of wildlife and plants.  National Museum  Tour the National Museum in Taherir Square in Dar al-Shukr (Palace of Gratefulness); it contains engravings of pre-Islamic times, bronze statues, a beautiful mashrabia (cooling place for water) and several examples of folk art.  Rawdha  Visit Rawdha, some 8km (5 miles) north of Sana'a, a garden city famous for its sweet grapes, the mosque built by Ahmed ibn al-Qasim and the Rawdha Palace, now used as a hotel.  Sa'dah  Tour the walled city of Sa'dah. The al-Hadi Mosque is still an important institution for education in Zaydism. It is possible to walk along the top of the city walls, which offer good views of the city. Sad'ah Basin  Walk amongst Yemen's early crops of grapes in the strikingly fertile Sad'ah Basin.  Sana'a  To see Old Sana'a, drive along the sunken street of the Sailah towards Sana'a's ancient heart, which for many visitors, is their first and possibly most enduring memory of Yemen.  Here the treasure of Sana'a, its characteristic tower houses defines a capital like no other the world over. Other highlights include the Souk al Milh for a shopping experience that's a far cry from the global High Street, and for a street bursting with simple and cheap Yemeni food head to Restaurant Street off Hadda Street.  Sana’a Mountain Villages  Even those limited to San'a can still make a full day excursion to its surrounding villages.  Head for fortified Kawkaban, the silversmiths of Thula and the famed Hamida restaurant of Shibam.  Shibam (Hadhramawt)  This walled desert city on the open plain is another architectural gem designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.  Likened to a 'Manhattan of the Desert' by early 20th-century traveller and writer Freya Stark, Shibam's 500 mud tower houses, some nine stories high, are 500 years old and are home to 5,000 people.  Socotra  Finally designated as a World Biosphere Reserve in 2008 the remote Socotra archipelago is the Arabian answer to the Galapagos in terms of unique flora and fauna.  700-year-old Dragon's Blood trees and Socotra Desert Rose set against the Tolkeinesque peaks of the Haggier Mountains characterise a unique lanscape.  Undeveloped, unspoilt, with few roads - only 2,000 visitors make landfall each year.  Ta'izz  Capital of North Yemen until 1962 this town has a very different feel to Sana'a.  Though the 'old city' has been all but swallowed up by the fast-growing modernity, beautiful old houses and mosques remain within the line of the 13th-century city wall, still intact along the southern perimeter.  Wadi Wa'aar  Enjoy the subtropical climate of Wadi Wa'aar, lying between Sana'a and Sa'dah in the north. Out of this rises the Shahara, a huge mountain massif, the highest point being nearly 3,000m (9,840ft) above sea level. This can be climbed by foot or by 4-wheel drive car.",middle east,,
panama,"Think Panama and what springs to mind? The canal? Cigars? Straw hats? Probably all three. However, for those in the know, this slender Central American nation is much more than that; it is a land of wildlife-rich rainforests and remote indigenous communities; Miami-esque promenades and paradisiacal beaches; verdant volcanoes and the impenetrable wilderness of the Darien Gap.      Firstly, the canal. Though considered to be the star attraction (thousands flock here to watch container ships passing through the locks) the wild landscapes it scythes through are an altogether more exciting prospect. Here you can hike volcanoes, zip-wire over forest canopies, raft down rapids and meet one of the country’s largest indigenous groups, the Kunas, who eke out simple, traditional lives on the sumptuous San Blas Islands.      The Caribbean coastline features another facet of Panamanian culture. Jamaicans and Barbadians, drafted in to build the canal, ended up settling here and an Afro-Caribbean vibe endures to this day. The nearby Bocas del Toro islands, meanwhile, are the definition of Caribbean island ideal with their palm-fringed beaches, limpid lagoons and sleepy eco-lodges.      The wildlife is also spectacular. Whale watching in the Golfo de Chiriquí is a must and you never forget scuba diving or snorkeling alongside turtles in the Coiba National Marine Park. Its birdlife surpasses neighbouring Costa Rica and the most treasured sightings are the iconic harpy eagle, Panama’s national bird, and the endangered great green macaw.      With so much natural beauty to imbibe, it is easy to overlook the bustling capital, Panama City. But don’t. A metropolis divided starkly between the past and present, it is a city where crumbling colonial buildings stand in the shadows of high-rise steel and glass towers. It feels a little bit like Miami and the locals certainly give their US counterparts a run for their money in the hedonism stakes. Come join the party.","Panama  Attractions in Panama  Browse old and new Panama City  Spread out along a wide bay, Panama City is a curiously appealing blend of colonial Spain and cosmopolitan modernity, well worth a couple of days' exploration. The historic old town is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, its narrow cobblestone streets lined with elegantly faded colonial buildings, whereas the new areas of the city are full of gleaming skyscrapers housing multinational corporations.  Climb Baru Volcano  Straddling the border with Costa Rica, the dormant Baru Volcano is a superb setting for a day's hiking or horseback ride, with the added potential excitement of spotting a quetzal, one of Central America's most iconic birds. Reaching 3,475m (11,400ft), it is located in beautiful Chiriquí Province, near the popular resort town of Boquete and the mountain resort, Cerro Punta.  Cruise the Panama Canal  A cruise along the Panama Canal is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. You can do a partial trip or go from Colon all the way to Panama City. The scenery en route is beautiful and the mechanics of the canal fascinating. Also recommended is the Panama Canal Museum in the capital's Casco Viejo, which details the canal's spectacular engineering and its human and environmental cost.  Get a taste of luxury in the rainforest  If you like your jungle experience to come with luxurious trappings, visit the Gamboa Tropical Rainforest Reserve. Less than an hour from Panama City between the Chagres River and the Panama Canal, the reserve is home to a wealth of tropical wildlife, but also has a five-star resort, and tree-top eco-lodge.  Go diving and snorkelling  Apart from its stunning Caribbean location, the Bocas del Toro archipelago is one of Panama's top diving and snorkelling locations. You'll be amazed by the variety of marine life on offer here, but other diving hotspots include the Isla Grande, near Portobelo, where dive centres run excursions to the best reefs, and the San Blás Islands, off the northeast coast.  Hike around Barro Colorado  Take a day trip from Panama City to the island of Barro Colorado in Gatun Lake, a vast manmade stretch of water created during construction of the Panama Canal. The island is a biological reserve and reputed to be one of the world's leading natural tropical laboratories; you can hike around the island in a few hours, spotting wildlife such as monkeys, anteaters and birds.  Join the carnival in Las Tablas  Capital of the Los Santos province of Panama, Las Tablas plays host to several bustling fiestas throughout the year, including one of the country's best Carnival celebrations. The Las Tablas Carnival involves two factions, each with a parade and its own festivities, trying to outdo the other. You don't have to take sides, just join in with both groups.  Roam the wilderness of Darién National Park  The sparsely populated wilderness of the Darién Gap is one of Central America's most inaccessible regions. Nevertheless, you can explore trails in the Darién National Park, which contains sandy beaches, rocky coasts, mangroves, swamps and tropical rainforest. The park is also home to two Choco Indian tribes, as well as one of the world's greatest concentrations of bird species.  See Panama City’s historic highlights  Panama City's Casco Viejo is its old quarter; highlights are the Plaza de Francia, the Paseo de las Bóvedas, San José Church, with its magnificent golden Baroque altar, and the Santo Domingo Church, next to which is the Museum of Colonial Religious Art. The most impressive building in Panama City, however, is the President's Palace, an opulent 17th-century mansion overlooking the bay.  Swing through the tree canopy  Embark on a tree canopy adventure in the El Níspero Botanical Gardens, in central Panama's Anton Valley. Hoick yourself into a harness, climb up to the treetops and then swing from one platform to another like Tarzan on a day-trip. Get up among the birds and enjoy the greenery from their perspective.  Take the panga to Taboga  Escape the noise and traffic of Panama City and hop on the ferry to the island of Taboga, with its fine beaches and clean sea air. The best way to get there is by local water taxi, known as a panga. A longer trip by launch is necessary to get to the Pearl Islands, which are visited mainly by sea-anglers and whale-watchers.  Tour Panama Viejo, sacked by pirates  Take an excursion to the ruins of Panama Viejo, including the square tower of the old cathedral, in the capital's western suburbs. This is the original Panama City, sacked in 1671 by celebrated Welsh buccaneer Henry Morgan, who helped undermine Spanish control of their colonies. Clamber around the crumbling walls, which also contain a museum and an excellent handicrafts market.  Try Panama’s big Atlantic surf  Along with Venado and Rio Mar in the Pacific and Isla Grande, Bluf and Careneros in the Atlantic, Santa Catalina is known as a prime surfer's spot in Panama. Waves can reach 4.5m (15ft), and you can find good surfing almost all year round. Panama is just beginning to be discovered as a surfer's paradise, so get down there before the crowds come.  Visit the Kuna of the San Blas Islands  One of Panama's most popular adventures is to the San Blas Islands, home of the Kuna, considered the most autonomous indigenous people of Latin America. The inhabitants live a traditional agriculture and fishing-based life, supported by tourism. The colourfully dressed women produce equally vivid mola embroideries for sale to visitors. You can stay here in rustic lodges, snorkel off the beach, and tour the local villages.  Witness Chiriquí’s log-throwing contest  Visit this western coastal province to see some of the country's most spectacular scenery, with volcanic highlands, waterfalls, and rivers, as well as banana and coffee plantations. Chiriquí is also host to Las Balserias, a Ngöbé-Bugle Indian celebration featuring a contest in which the young men toss balsa logs at one another; those who emerge unscathed may choose their partners.",north america,,
ontario,"Energetic cities, sprawling forests and more than half a million lakes are just some of the reasons why Ontario pulls in the crowds.      Most start their Ontario adventure in buzzing Toronto, a jewel in the province’s crown, whose multicultural inhabitants lend the city a genuinely cosmopolitan edge. You can cheer on the Maple Leafs in their quest for the Stanley Cup, glug the latest craft brew in historic pubs and stuff your face with mini doughnuts from a foodtruck. And what’s the point looking out the windows of the CN Tower when you can skirt its roof on the vertigo-inducing EdgeWalk?      In Canada’s capital city, Ottawa, knowing whether to say “bonjour” or “hello” is always a quandary, so just say both. Skate the world’s largest ice rink, the Rideau Canal, or gen up on all things Canadian in the city’s fabulous museums.      You don’t have to travel far to find nature. Equidistant from both cities, Algonquin Provincial Park is a quintessentially Canadian landscape of maple-blanketed hills splashed with thousands of lakes. It dishes up quintessentially Canadian experiences, too: wilderness hiking, 2,100km (1,300 miles) of canoeing routes, and the chance to land the biggest trout of your life. Also a short drive from Toronto are the booming Niagara Falls, one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the world.      And then there are the lakes. Ontario borders four of the five Great Lakes, most notably Lake Huron, home to Fathom Five National Marine Park and its extraordinary shipwrecks. Elsewhere there are lakes for fishing, lakes for canoeing, lakes for swimming and lakes for diving. Come on in, the water’s lovely.","Ontario  Attractions in Ontario  Behold the great butterfly migration  Beautiful and unique (to Ontario) monarch butterflies stop off at Point Pelee on Lake Erie in September during their annual migration to the mountains of central Mexico. These colourful insects cover the trees, providing an amazing spectacle.  Canada's capital city  In Canada's capital city, you can admire the imposing gothic-style Parliament Buildings, Peace Tower, Confederation Square (site of the National War Memorial), and the Rideau Canal, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Among the city's many museums and galleries are the National Gallery of Canada, the Canada Science and Technology Museum and the Canadian Museum of Nature. Just across the Ontario River in Quebec, the Canadian Museum of History is also worth a visit.  Canoeing across Ontario   Ontario is particularly well known for canoeing, and has more canoe routes than any other region in the world - more than 5,400km (3,355 miles) of routes in northwestern Ontario alone. Good locations include Killarney and Algonquin Provincial Parks in southern Ontario, the latter being within three hours' drive of Toronto.  Climb CN Tower  Thrill seekers can hurtle up to the top of the CN Tower in Toronto (www.cntower.ca): Canada's national tower was until recently the world's tallest freestanding structure. From the public observation deck in its SkyPod, 447m (1,465ft) above the ground, you can see Niagara Falls on a clear day.  Flip some pancakes  The Sandy Flat Sugar Bush and Pancake House in Warkworth hosts the annual Maple Syrup Festival in March. Amongst the many demonstrations, races and contests is also the chance to sample lots of this sweet and sticky fluid liberally poured onto anything from pancakes to sausages. The maple trees and their sap are unique to eastern North America and Ontario is very proud of its culinary links to the syrup.  Get closer to nature in Algonquin Park  Nature lovers are drawn to the protected wilderness of Algonquin Park, Ontario's oldest provincial park; 7,600 sq km (2,934 sq miles) of forest and lakeland provide the perfect environment for outdoor recreation. For campers and day visitors, Highway 60 is the centre of the park, offering campgrounds, walking trails, conducted hikes and access to public wolf-howling sessions. In winter, cross country skiing trails are popular. Visitors can also soak up the history of the park in the Logging Museum, or in the Algonquin Gallery, which focuses on the Canadian artist Tom Thomson's (1877-1917) famous group of painters, the Group of Seven.  Get your skis on  Midland commands a spectacular view of the Muskoka-Georgian Bay lake district and is a popular resort, mainly because of the various minor ski resorts located around Georgian Bay.  Hiking  From hiking trails on the Bruce Peninsula, the views are spectacular.  National Gallery of Canada  The National Gallery of Canada was founded in 1880 by the Governor General, the Marquess of Lorne and since then has grown to become an internationally-renowned art museum. The permanent collections reflect Canada's diverse history, and includes works by European masters such as Monet, Turner and Di Cosimo, as well as avant-garde Canadian paintings from the 1960s and religious sculptures from Québec. The museum also contains a large collection of Inuit art, including prints, drawings and whale bone sculptures, many of which portray the cultural and social issues that have affected Canada's indigenous population since WWII.  Niagara Falls  A must-see; Niagara Falls are a legacy of the Ice Age, gushing out half a million gallons of water every second. The falls are made up of two separate parts, Horseshoe Falls on the Canadian side and American Falls  on the USA side. Although not the highest waterfall in the world they move a staggering 168,000 cubic metres (219,600 cubic yards) of water per minute over a drop of 51m (167ft), making them one of the natural wonders of the world. The city of Niagara Falls itself is stuffed with wax museums and theme restaurants, but just to the north lies the storybook village of Niagara-on-the-Lake. Southwest of the falls, the north shore of Lake Erie is dotted with small resorts and good beaches; Port Stanley is particularly popular.  See artwork in the rocks  Lake Superior Provincial Park has many beautiful ravines, lakes and waterfalls. In particular, its Agawa Rock Pictographs are highly famed. These are one of the largest collections of Indian rock art in Ontario. The pictographs remain one of Superior's most sacred spots.  Visit Toronto  Canada's largest city is also the provincial capital. The CN Tower has glass-fronted elevators rising to indoor observation decks that afford a 160km (100-mile) panoramic view on a clear day. Yorkville, the hip part of town in the 1960s, now caters to the tastes of the city's upwardly mobile, but is a good spot to go window shopping or enjoy a cup of coffee. Queen Street West attracts a younger, more style-conscious crowd. In the eastern suburbs, the spectacular Ontario Science Centre and the Toronto Zoo are both worth seeing.  Watch Shakespeare in the summer  The Stratford Shakespeare Festival focuses mainly (but not exclusively) on the Bard's plays, while the Shaw Festival in Niagara-on-the-Lake highlights the works of George Bernard Shaw and his contemporaries, and the Blyth Festival presents Canadian plays.",north america,canada,
greece,"A flavourful melting pot of sparkling nightspots, fresh seafood, sizzling Mediterranean passion and mythical legend, Greece is a fascinating and enchanting destination.      The country has long held appeal for travellers who flock to its shores to lounge on beaches, explore ancient relics and take advantage of the legendary Grecian hospitality.      Yet despite its popularity, there is still an undiscovered feel to parts of Greece with Mount Olympus, the Peloponnese coast and some of the more remote islands slipping, for now at least, under the radar of mass tourism.      The first port of call for most visitors is Athens, the country's stunning capital, which combines a modern centre with the stark ancient beauty of the Parthenon and a position overlooking a cerulean stretch of the Saronic Gulf.      Like the rest of the country, Athens was built on a classical civilisation that produced some of the world's greatest thinkers, philosophers and poets. The ancient Greeks also brought the world democracy, which locals cheerfully remind visitors about, and a pantheon of deities, who are celebrated through statues and local folklore.      Everywhere has its own legend; from the tiny island of Ithaca, home to the wanderer Odysseus, to the rugged stretch of the Peloponnese, the onetime playground of divine beings.      Though the glory days of the Ancient Greeks have passed, the country remains one of Europe's leading holiday destinations, thanks largely to its gorgeous collection of islands, which are scattered like confetti across the Mediterranean Sea.      Greece boasts 6,000 islands and islets in all, all of which only 277 are inhabited. Among them is Rhodes, which was home to the ancient Minoan culture and, legend has it, the terrifying Minotaur. Today it is better known for its stunning beaches, charming seaside towns and lively nightlife.      The islands of Corfu, Crete and Santorini are also established hangouts for sun-seekers and merrymakers, while Kos has begun to attract deities of a very modern kind – the world’s rich and famous. Ultimately, though, in democratic Greece, everyone is welcome.","Greece  Attractions in Greece  Athens  The birthplace of democracy, Athens remains an important cultural hub. Crowned with four ancient Greek temples, the Acropolis is arguably the most important attraction. After that, stroll down to the Ancient Agora, once Athens' civic, political and commercial centre. The city also has a plethora of world-class museums, including the National Archaeological Museum which is packed with ancient marble statues, jewellery and ceramics. Check out the Athens travel guide for more information.  Delphi  Believed by the ancients to be the centre of the world, Delphi was home to Apollo and Pythia (high priestess of the Temple of Apollo), Classical Greece's most notable oracle. The religious complex, set on a stunning hillside site, comprises classical temples, a theatre and a stadium. Delphi also hosted the Pythian Games, started in 582BC and said to be precursors of the Olympic Games.  Epirus  Straddles between the Pindos mountain range and the Ionian Sea, the region of Epirus attracts visitors who desire a mix of adventure and natural scenery. Sustainable tourism and agritourism, offered by farmhouses in traditional villages, also provide wonderful fleece-to-garment and farm-to-table experiences. Check out this article on Epirus.  Meteora  On the edge of a flat plain in Thessaly, Central Greece lies the Meteora, a group of monasteries built atop sandstone pinnacles designed to keep the monks and nuns safe. UNESCO-listed, only six of the original 24 monasteries survive and they are open to the public.  Mount Athos  Known as 'Holy Mountain', Mount Athos covers a 335 sq km (130 sq mile) peninsula. An Orthodox spiritual centre since 1054, Mount Athos consists of 20 Orthodox monasteries, 1,400 monks, and an invaluable collection of frescoes and religious art. Although part of Greece, Mount Athos has a special self-administered system under Hellenic Constitutional Law. Women and children are banned. Only 100 Orthodox and 100 non-Orthodox male pilgrims are admitted to the site each day. Applications must be approved by the Mount Athos Pilgrim's Bureau.  Olympia  Olympia is the birthplace of the Olympic Games, which were first held here in 776 BC. Situated on the Peloponnese peninsula, the site boasts many ancient ruins including the Hippodrome where ancient horse races were held. The Museum of the Olympic Games is well worth a visit. Olympia was also an important worship site of Zeus – today, visitors also come to see the ruins of the Temple of Zeus and the Temple of Hera.  The Cyclades Islands and Santorini  Consisting of 56 islands scattered across the Aegean Sea, the Cyclades includes Santorini, one of the most Instagrammable places in the world. Other islands with classic whitewashed villages and turquoise waters are Mykonos, Milos, Folegandros and Serifos. The uninhabited Delos is said to be the birthplace of Apollo.  The Dodecanese Islands and Rhodes  Situated in south-eastern Aegean Sea, The Dodecanese Islands are closer to Turkey than mainland Greece. Rhodes is the largest island and its UNESCO-listed Medieval Old Town consists of immaculately preserved buildings where the knights of St John once lived.  The Ionian Islands and Corfu  Off the western coast of Greece, many of the Ionian Islands have sheer cliffs, olive groves and sandy beaches. Packed with 19th-century neo-classical mansions, Corfu (Kerkyra) is a popular holiday destination. Less touristy islands include Paxos, Antipaxos, Lefkada and Ithaka.  Thessaloniki  The second largest city in Greece has a rich Byzantine and Ottoman past. The White Tower, on the seaside promenade, was once an Ottoman prison where public executions were held. But today it represents freedom and is the symbol of the city. Other must-see sights include the Roman Agora (Forum), Arch of Galerius and Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki.",europe,,
tasmania,"Ever the bridesmaid to mainland Australia, Tasmania is finally stepping out of the shadows. The only question is: how did it take so long?      An archipelago of extraordinary natural beauty, tiny Tassie is similar in size to Ireland, yet it boasts a staggering diversity of landscapes; from snow-capped mountains and sweeping sandy beaches to ancient rainforest and rolling heathland.      Almost a third of the island state is set aside in national parks, most notably the Tasmanian World Heritage Wilderness Area, which is home the tallest flowering plants in the world and second tallest trees – after California’s redwoods.      These forests harbour distinctive wildlife, many of which are endemic species found nowhere else on Earth. The sharp-fanged Tasmanian devil – the largest carnivorous marsupial on the planet – is perhaps the most famous example. Other favourites include the duck-billed platypus, fairy penguin and wallaby.      Beyond its bountiful natural assets, Tasmania is a destination of increasing cultural significance. In recent years a thriving arts scene has developed in Hobart, which gained a world-class attraction in 2011 with the opening of the Museum of Old and New Art (MONA), the largest privately-funded museum in Australia.      At the same time Tasmania has emerged as one of the most exciting culinary destinations in Australasia, giving the restaurants of Sydney and Melbourne a run for their money. Its success as a gastronomic destination has much to do with the island itself; not only does Tasmania boast the cleanest air in the world, but its fertile soil and pristine oceans have conspired to provide local chefs with some of the purest ingredients available.      It may be hard to believe today, but, for so long, Tasmania was mocked by mainlanders for its isolation and old fashioned ways. But as Australians and international tourists flock to the islands in increasing numbers, there’s a feeling that Tasmania is having the last laugh.","Tasmania  Attractions in Tasmania  Capture Russell Falls in all its glory  Watch water cascade down the 45m (148ft) high Russell Falls, a pretty display of nature in the Mount Field National Park, and contender for most-photographed waterfall in Australia.

The flanks of the mountain are heavily forested and at the summit there is a lookout point, which has beautiful views across the city, all the way through to Bruny Island and Storm Bay, where the Derwent Estuary opens onto the Tasman.  Explore Freycinet National Park  Step into Freycinet National Park on Tasmania's east coast and gambol amongst glorious heaths, wildflowers and the white sands of Wineglass Bay, where the azure waters of the Tasman Sea lap gently on the shore. Absolutely stunning.  Hike along Cataract Gorge  Cataract Gorge is a slice of Tasmanian wilderness famous for its basalt cliffs and dramatic scenery. Located just 15 minutes by foot from Launceston, the gorge has various hiking trails, as well as a restaurant, swimming pool and chairlift. Resident peacocks roam the gardens of the nearby visitor centre, which is also home to a café.  Hit the slopes  Tasmania lays claim to a handful of ski resorts, but the biggest is Ben Lomond, which is home to the Summit Run. If you are planning of skiing there base yourself at the Creek Inn, which has the bragging rights to being Tasmania's highest pub. Even in the winter Ben Lomond is still worthy of a visit; Alpine wildflowers run rampant in spring and summer when bushwalking becomes the main activity. www.skibenlomond.com.au  Imbibe Tasmanian art at MONA  Described as a ‘subversive adult Disneyland,’ the controversial Museum of Old and New Art (MONA) has put Tasmania firmly on the cultural map. Its riverside collection boasts 400 works include an Egyptian sarcophagus and a machine that produces, ahem, poo. Located on the Moorilla vineyard, the museum is within staggering distance of a wine bar, microbrewery, restaurant, cinema and fancy guest accommodation, The Pavilions. www.mona.net.au  Meet a Tasmanian devil  Located in the beautiful Cradle Mountain National Park, Devils @ Cradle offers visitors the chance to meet some of Tasmania's most iconic species including the spotted-tail quoll, the eastern quoll and, of course, the iconic Tasmanian devil. The sanctuary was set up to help conserve these endangered species, which are unique to Tasmania. www.devilsatcradle.com  Sail away on the Tasmanian breeze  Sail into Tasmanian bliss on a boat or sailing cruise. It's a popular way to explore the port cities of Launceston and Hobart, and outlying islands. You can explore the southwest coast from Strahan on the west coast.  Study colonial era art  Study Tasmanian colonial era art and Aboriginal art at the Queen Victoria Museum and Art Gallery (www.qvmag.tas.gov.au) at its two locations: the Art Gallery at Royal Park in Launceston, and the Museum in Inveresk. The Gallery exhibits include a Chinese temple and joss house.  Take a road trip down the Tasman Peninsula  Observe the Blowhole, Devil's Kitchen, Tasman Arch, Tessellated Pavement and other coastal splendours on a scenic drive down the Tasman Peninsula. There are terrific views from Eaglehawk Neck over Pirates Bay and beyond.  Trek Cradle Mountain  Gasp at Tasmania's dramatic mountain peaks, situated in the World Heritage Wilderness Area of Cradle Mountain/Lake St Clair National Park. Famous for the 65km (40 mile) Overland Track bushwalk, the mountain bursts with natural wonders including rainforest, alpine heath, glacial lakes and ancient pines.  Unwind in the Royal Botanical Gardens  Located on a headland facing the river, a 15-minute stroll from the city, the old worldly gardens are an outdoor lover's joy brimming with century old trees. There's also a Subantarctic Plant House, heritage buildings and a visitor's centre embracing souvenir shop, restaurant and art gallery.  Visit ‘hell on Earth’  A former British penal colony, Port Arthur was described by inmates as 'hell on Earth.' Today its crumbling ramparts are a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the most popular tourist attraction in Tasmania. Between 1833 and 1853 it received the most notorious British criminals, who were the subject of physical and psychological punishment.  Walk on air  Suspended above a spectacular forest canopy, some 37m (121ft) above the ground, the Tahune AirWalk certainly requires a head for heights. The lofty causeway forms part of the Huon Trail, which includes detours to the Hastings thermal pool, caves and the sheltered bays of the D'Entrecasteaux Channel. Alternatively, the Hollybank Treetops Adventure involves cable 'flights' above Hollybank Forest Reserve. www.adventureforests.com.au  Walk the Walls of Jerusalem  Located in the Tasmanian Central Highlands, the Walls of Jerusalem National Park offer epic landscapes that belie Tasmania's diminutive size.

portugal,"Like the Atlantic Ocean that laps upon its shores, Portugal throws up one or two surprises. A rich and varied land of vibrant cities and traditional villages, visitors are astounded by the country’s stunning beaches, rolling countryside and cornucopia of UNESCO World Heritage Sites, which range from prehistoric drawings at Foz Coa to the 15th-century port of Angra do Heroísmo.      The country’s lively capital, Lisbon, and its vibrant northern sibling, Porto, are a joy to discover. They are cities where trams rattle up and down hills and along promenades, trundling past narrow side streets and majestic plazas, bohemian cafés and pumping nightclubs, eye-catching boutiques and restaurants both hip and homespun.      It’s not all about Lisbon and Porto, though. Sintra plays host to the stunning National Palace, a Moorish castle and the dramatic villa of Quinta da Regaleira, while the cities of Coimbra, Guimarães, Braga and Évora all boast beautifully preserved medieval quarters. Unusually, the latter is home to a chapel made exclusively of human bones, which is a tad creepy.      Travellers in search of a rural respite can wander around ancient vineyards, trek to stone villages perched in the mountains and take full advantage of the country’s warm and sunny weather on the magnificent southern shoreline.

ethiopia,"Putting its turbulent history behind, Ethiopia has been busy transforming its economy and making remarkable progress in infrastructure development over the past two decades. Today tourists are returning to the country in increasing numbers, keen to discover its wondrous landscapes, ancient religious sites and fascinating indigenous tribes.      Billed as 'The Land of Origins' by the Ethiopian Tourism Organisation, this amazing country is where the Blue Nile begins and home of the 3.2-million-year-old hominid fossil 'Lucy', whose discovery has put Ethiopia on the map as the cradle of humanity. One of the oldest Christian nations in the world, Ethiopia is a multi-ethnic and multifaceted destination where the art of hospitality is alive and well. Visitors are typically greeted with a steaming cup of coffee, which is said to be first discovered in the region of Kaffa in southeast Ethiopia.      Most visitors start their Ethiopian odyssey in the capital Addis Ababa, a lively city nestling in the lofty Entoto Mountains. Founded in 1886 by Emperor Menelik II after his wife Empress Taytu chose the site for its hot mineral springs, Addis Ababa has enjoyed a fascinating transformation over a relatively short period of time. The city is now a hub of international missions and embassies, including the headquarters of the African Union and the UN Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA).      Few linger long in the Ethiopian capital, choosing instead to head north to Lalibela, a pilgrimage site famed for its ancient churches which have quite literally been hewn out of a cliff. Lalibela is one of nine UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Ethiopia. Other notables include the ancient Kingdom of Aksum (or Axum), the fairytale castle of Gondar, the walled city of Harar, the Konso cultural landscape, the prehistoric sites of Awash and Omo valleys, the mysterious stelae of Tiya and the spectacular Simien National Park where the indigenous Gelada baboon and Walia Ibex thrive.      Ultimately, it is Ethiopia's epic landscapes that truly capture the imagination of many travellers. From the cloud-shrouded peak of Ras Dashen (the highest mountain in Ethiopia) to the sulphur fumaroles of the Danakil Depression (which is also the lowest point in Ethiopia at 125m/410ft below sea level), the scenery could inspire paintings, provoke poetry.      These wild environments sustain ancient tribes such as the Bodi, whose men live on a diet of blood and milk in a bid to become the region's fattest man of the year, and the Hamer, famous for their dangerous bull-jumping ceremony which is considered a rite of passage for young men.      Ethiopia has come a long way since the famine of 1983-85 which prompted Bob Geldof to write the fundraising hit Do They Know It's Christmas? (by a curious twist of fate, he now owns a stake in a wine company in Ethiopia). This country, long misunderstood by many, is now enjoying a booming economy, posting a strong and sustainable 8% to 11% growth rate since the turn of the 21st-century.      With Ethiopian Airlines boasting a wide network of air routes radiating from Addis Ababa, travelling to and around the country is getting easier, and for those who ride it out, the rewards are immense.","Ethiopia  Attractions in Ethiopia  Addis Ababa  This high-altitude capital city, at 2,355m (7,726 ft), hides a multitude of charms. Though sprawling and chock-a-block with traffic, it is home to many fascinating museums including the Ethiopian National Museum where the star attraction is the 3.2-million-year-old Lucy, humankind's oldest ancestor. When the sun goes down, enjoy a fantastic Ethiopian meal with local music and dance at one of the many cultural restaurants scattered across town.  Aksum (Axum)  According to folklore, Aksum was once home to the legendary Queen of Sheba mentioned in the Old Testament. The local legend says she travelled to meet King Solomon in Jerusalem and bore him a son, King Menilik I, who was raised in Ethiopia but later travelled to Jerusalem and came back to the Kingdom of Aksum with the Ark of the Covenant. Today, the Aksum Stelae Park is the main attraction but you can also peek across the St Mary of Zion Church to see the chapel where the Ark is supposedly kept.      On the first seven days of each month (according to the Ethiopian calendar), there is a procession where St Mary of Zion's replica Ark is paraded through the streets with thousands of pilgrims following the Ark and chanting in unison. The procession, locally known as Mihla or Mehelela, starts at 0500 on Daro Eila (square).  Babile  An easy daytrip from the walled city of Harar, tracking elephants on foot is the major highlight of a visit to Babile, though the sanctuary is also home to plentiful birdlife, gazelles, and rarely-seen lions, leopards and cheetahs. Gorges give way to rocky outcrops and tree-studded grassland home to more than a quarter of Ethiopia’s elephant population.  Bale Mountains  The Bale Mountains offers hikers and horse riders high-altitude mountain scenery. The circuit, with a well-organised series of lodges along the way, passes through remote villages, high grasslands and dense forest, with great wildlife spotting potential.  Danakil Depression  Surreal and otherworldly, the Danakil Depression is one of the lowest and hottest places on Earth, coming in at 125m (410 ft) below sea-level with temperatures that regularly top 41°C (106°F). This geological wonderland is a magical place featuring vistas of swirling orange twisted rock, lava lakes, and fiercely traditional nomads. The star attraction is Erta Ale, an active volcano bubbling at 1,000°C (1,832°F).  Gondar  Africa's own fairytale castles are a testament to the wealth and whimsy of Emperor Fasil who made Gondar his capital in the 17th century. The 7-hectare (17-acre) UNESCO World Heritage site is now a museum complex encompassing six fortified stone castles and a sunken pool where Gondar's colourful annual Timkat (Ethiopian Epiphany) takes place with a re-enactment of the first baptism. Entrance fee is 200 Birr per person.  Harar  The historic walled city of Harar is a labyrinth of dusty alleyways. Once the commercial hub between Arabia and Africa, legendary tales led both explorer Richard Burton and French poet Rimbaud here. Today Harar oozes a lost-in-time ambience that enchants all who visit, while the Muslims consider it the fourth holy city of Islam. The hyena feeding ritual, which takes place every evening on its outskirts, adds to its exotic appeal.  Konso cultural landscape  Despite modernity's slow encroachment, the Konso people have stayed true to their cultural heritage, proudly preserving their unique maze-like village architecture and way of life. Some of the top places to visit in the region are the town of Konso itself and the villages of Buso, Dokatu, Gamole and Macheke.  Lake Chamo  Situated by the Nechisar National Park, this high-altitude lake is home to a healthy population of crocodiles who like to sun themselves on the banks of the lake or glide through the water. Afternoon boat trips on the lake where you can see these massive creatures up close and personal (and maybe hippos too) are a must.  Lake Tana  The source of the Blue Nile, Lake Tana is one of Ethiopia's most fascinating places. Fishermen glide across the shimmering lake surface in traditional papyrus boats, while many its 37 islands are home to priestly communities and their ancient, round thatched monasteries decorated with dazzling biblical murals. The best way to explore the lake monasteries is on a boat trip - but please note that not all monasteries allow female visitors. Not far away is the impressive Blue Nile Falls, best visited in August and September after the rainy season.  Lalibela  This massive complex of churches, hewn out of rose-pink rock, is a feat of 12th-century ingenuity and sheer willpower. Walking into one of the churches amid the eerily-beautiful chanting of priests will be an abiding memory of Ethiopia. It is highly recommended that you hire a guide who can explain the unique features of each church and how the layout of major churches is a symbolic representation of Jerusalem. The entrance fee to the church complex is US$50 per person. Apart from the churches, there is a good trekking network around Lalibela allowing visitors a cultural insight into village life as well as the chance to see other ancient churches including the cave church Yemrehanna Kristos.  Lower Omo Valley  The Lower Omo Valley is home to 16 culturally distinct tribes including the Mursi, known for the lip plates worn by female tribe members, and Hamer, whose females are famed for their ornate hairstyles while the men must perform a dangerous bull-jumping ceremony as an initiation into adulthood. Market days - when people from all tribes flock to the region's towns - are a colourful and fascinating experience.  Simien Mountains National Park  Trekking along the escarpment, surrounded by jagged pinnacles, with the slash of the Great Rift Valley tumbling down before you is one of the finest panoramas on the continent. This is also the home of the Gelada 'bleeding heart' baboons. Coming face-to-face with a troop of them while ambling along is almost guaranteed. Visitors who can spend a few days trekking through its grasslands and deep ravines are likely to see Walia Ibex (mountain goats with arching horns) and Ethiopian wolf, both are endemic to the Simien Mountains. Experienced trekkers may also want to tackle Ras Dashen, the highest peak in the country. Entrance fee is 90 Birr per person with extra for a guide and a ranger.  Tigray (rock hewn churches)  Carved into the towering canyons, the remote monolithic churches and monasteries of the Tigray region offer a fascinating look into religious life that has remained largely unchanged for centuries. The scenery here is ruggedly beautiful, and some of the monasteries are so precariously positioned they are reached by free climbing or a flimsy rope. Abuna Yemata Guh, one of the finest churches in the area, requires you to climb up the wind-worn sandstone cliff barefooted. Despite its remoteness, the church attracts about 80 worshippers every Sunday attending its service.",africa,,
azores,"For more than 500 years, the Azores, an archipelago of nine widely dispersed islands floating in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, have remained almost completely unspoiled and largely unvisited, mainly on account of their remoteness.      Volcanic in origin, these dramatic islands are pitted with deep craters, filled with shimmering lakes and covered with lush vegetation. Geysers and health-giving sulphur springs abound. For outdoorsy types, they are a joy to discover.      In contrast to the Azores Islands’ natural beauty are the large tracts of arable farmland, which are peppered with tiny settlements of whitewashed houses. Here you will see gently sloping hillsides planted with vineyards and fruit trees that are tended to by the archipelago’s hardy inhabitants.      Coastlines in the Azores tend to be rugged and somewhat forbidding – this is not exactly a beach destination – but there are plenty of bays and rocky inlets for swimming and sunbathing. Watersports are widely available, with a particular emphasis on scuba-diving, whale watching and yachting.      The Azores Islands are, sadly, a secret no more. Improved air links with Portugal, which claims sovereignty over the archipelago, and the rest of Europe are bringing more adventure-seeking tourists to the islands. Not that an increase in visitor numbers will diminish the charms of this destination, whose natural wonders tempt many back for a return trip.","Azores  Attractions in Azores  Delve into Algar do Carvão  Fascinating caves and tunnels await in Algar do Carvão on Terceira. You don't have to be a speleologist (someone who studies caves) to be taken aback by this collection of grottos and subterranean passages, which are blessed with all sorts of weird and wonderful rock formations.  Explore the Furna do Enxofre  Hidden beneath the verdant vegetation of Graciosa island is the great cave of Furna do Enxofre. This Indian Jones-esque grotto can be accessed via a brick staircase, which takes visitors to a warm sulphur lagoon at the bottom. Graciosa's natural attractions also include the subterranean lake of Caldeira and the hot springs of Carapacho.  Go trekking in São Miguel  A mecca for trekkers, São Miguel is the largest and arguably most beautiful of the eastern islands. Most hikers head to the picturesque Sete Cidades, a 40sq km (15sq mile) volcanic crater, which harbours two limpid lakes: one deep blue in colour and the other emerald green.  Kick back in pretty Ponta Delgada  The largest municipality in the Azores, Ponta Delgada is an attractive town with narrow cobbled streets, whitewashed houses and expensive yachts bobbing in the harbour. A former fishing village, it has a commendable selection of bars and restaurants serving local seafood and other regional fare.  Reel in a big fish  If you're that way inclined, the Azores islands are a great place to go big game fishing. There are huge marlins and tunas to be caught off the archipelago and there are charter boats available at many coastal resorts, particularly on Faial and São Miguel.  Ride the waves  The swells off Santa Maria and São Miguel islands can get pretty gnarly, which is music to the ears of surfers. As well as reliable waves, board-riders can take advantage of the lack of competition for them (the cool climate keeps the crowds at bay). For those who prefer the help of a sail, windsurfing lessons are available at the islands' sailing clubs.  Seek whales and dolphins  Marine life abounds off the coast of the Azores, where some 25 species of whale and dolphin have been spotted – including the giant sperm whale. The best sightings are from June to September in the waters around Faial, Pico and São Jorge. To get even closer to the action, strap a tank on your back and explore the local dive sites. Scuba shops at Faial and São Miguel will be able to kit you out.  Tee off  Golf. You can't escape it. And on the Azores it's no exception: the archipelago boasts three 18-hole golf courses in all. Two of them, Furnas and Batalha, are located on São Miguel and the third is on Terceira. Aside from some winter drizzle, the mild climate allows year-round play.  Watch Touradas a Corda  The Azores' answer to San Fermin (the running of the bulls), Touradas a Corda takes place between May and October and is a tradition on the island of Terceira. Unlike in Spain, the bulls are not killed at the end of the spectacle, although many may question the ethics of letting a bull loose in the street and encouraging spectators to wind it up.  While away the day in Angra do Heroismo  The historic town of Angra do Heroismo nestles on the coast of Terceira and is a fine place to while away a lazy day or two. Founded in the 15th century – and developed into a major outpost for the Portuguese and Spanish empires – the UNESCO-listed town has a quiet pace of life and pretty aesthetics. Bars and restaurants abound.",europe,portugal,
serbia,"Although its reputation took a hammering during the disastrous collapse of Yugoslavia in the 1990s, Serbia has since become one of Eastern Europe’s most entertaining destinations. Much of that is down to Belgrade, which, despite NATO bombing during the Milosevic regime, has emerged as a dynamic, edgy city with an appetite for hedonism.      Home to numerous excellent museums and galleries, a wide range of restaurants and cafés, and some of the best nightlife in southeast Europe, Belgrade is drawing comparisons with some of the world’s coolest cities. It is also helping lead the rest of the country into a bright and hopeful future, with a young generation of creative and outward-looking Serbs reshaping the historic land that was founded as a principality some 1,200 years ago.      Away from the capital, Novi Sad is an attractive, lively city with an elegant centre and picturesque fortress overlooking over the Danube. In the far north, Subotica has an array of secessionist architecture and a notable Hungarian character.      The province of Vojvodina, north of Belgrade, has some excellent wetland habitats that are home to numerous bird species, while south of the capital the countryside consists of lush, wooded valleys with hidden-away Orthodox monasteries. Scattered among the country's more mountainous regions are a number of vast national parks.      Serbia is known for the forthright character of its citizens; its resilient culture has survived numerous occupiers and foreign rulers over the centuries. Despite their formidable reputation, visitors will find Serbs to be passionate but welcoming. As an Orthodox Christian country, it remains to a large degree deeply religious, though this fact is belied somewhat by the hedonism found in its bigger cities.      While there are still some political problems in Serbia, which has yet to formally recognise Kosovo after it unilaterally declared independence in 2008, the country has turned a corner. It is officially a EU candidate and many Serbs are hopeful of the change in economic fortunes that might be brought by becoming a full member.","Serbia  Attractions in Serbia  Dine out in Skadarlija  Belgrade's 19th-century bohemian quarter boasts restaurants serving typical Serbian cuisine, especially cevapi, grilled minced meat. If you choose to sit outside, don't be surprised if you're serenaded at dinner. There are also several art galleries nearby.  Disentangle the diverse history of Nis  See the Ottoman sights of Nis, Serbia's third largest city in the southeast boast plenty of relics from the Ottoman era, including a fortress and the gruesome Skull Tower. The remains of the Roman town of Mediana also lie in the vicinity.  Explore the culture wonders of Novi Sad  Often referred to as the ""Serbian Athens"", Novi Sad is an attractive city on the Danube and a cultural centre with museums, galleries, libraries and theatres along with numerous churches that represent a wide variety of denominations. The second city is also home to the imposing Petrovaradin Citadel.  Explore the sprawling Djerdap National Park  The gorgeous Djerdap National Park spans 64,000 hectares (158,146 acres) and is a paradise for nature lovers. Its main attraction is the Djerdap Gorge, a river valley made from four gorges. Other national parks worth a look are Sara, Fruska Gora, Kopaonik and Tara.  Follow Serbia's old wine routes  Serbia is a long-running producer of wines and following some of the old wine routes is rewarding. The Palic wine route follows the trail of ""Wines from the Sands"" where the winemaking tradition is over 2,000 years old. Other wine routes in Serbia include Vrsac, Oplenac, Smederevo, Negotin and Zupa.  Hike through the Fruska Gora region  Go hiking or birdwatching in the hills of the national park of Fruska Gora to the south of Novi Sad, following woodland trails and discovering half-hidden monasteries. Dominated by a lone mountain, the reserve stretches as far as the Danube River, to the edge of the historic city of Sremski Karlovci.  Make a pilgrimage to the Monastery of Zica  Near Kraljevo, visit the restored Monastery of Zica where the kings of Serbia were once crowned. It was built by the first King of the Serbs in the 13th century, and is curious red-coloured structure, with a modest Orthodox-style dome. In the same part of central Serbia are the pretty Kalenic and Ljubostina convents, both fine examples of the Serbian Morava School of architecture.  Ride the Sargan Eight Railway  Take a pleasure ride on the Sargan Eight Railway at Mokra Gora, close to the Bosnian border. An old narrow-gauge railway that was once an important part of the Belgrade to Sarajevo route, it was closed in the 1970s. The hour-long railway journey climbs 300m (1,000ft) in just 3.5km (2 miles), winding through pretty green hills most of the way.  Tap into the cultural buzz of the capital Belgrade  Belgrade has a bit of everything. In the Old Town, visit Kalemegdan Park and Belgrade Fortress overlooking the confluence of the Sava and Danube rivers. Nearby landmarks include the enormous Cathedral of St Sava and Princess Ljubica's Konak, an 1831 Turkish-style residence. There's also an irreverent nightlife held down by Sava, for which Belgrade has earned the moniker ""new Berlin"".  Wonder at the museums of Belgrade  Visit some of Belgrade's excellent museums and galleries: the Nikola Tesla Museum for live demonstrations of the scientist's impressive inventions and the Museum of Yugoslav History where former prime minister Tito is buried within the grounds. At the Ethnographic Musuem visitors can learn more about Serbia's culture and see handcrafted artefacts.",europe,,
hong kong,"Steamy and gargantuan, Hong Kong has evolved into one of Asia’s most lovable cities. Its incredible skyline – part neon, part steel-and-glass, part towering hills – is one of the most majestic in the world, but it’s a mere backdrop to the 24-hour flurry of activity that makes Hong Kong what it is.      From its boat-buzzed waterfront to its packed dim sum restaurants, its incense-smoked temples to its clattering teahouses, its street markets to its old-world hotels, Hong Kong is a destination teeming with energy. For travellers, the best advice is to go with the flow.      Situated at the mouth of the Pearl River Delta on China’s southwestern coast, Hong Kong is a city that has a remarkable mix of Eastern and Western influences. The handover of this territory from Britain to China was back in 1997, but the centuries of British rule still have a lasting legacy, tangible in everything from the grand period architecture to the local passion for horse-racing.      Even the name of Hong Kong’s centrepiece – the iconic Victoria Harbour – harks back to another era, and today there’s an international flavour to the destination that sets it apart from other Chinese cities. The gastronomy, nightlife and shopping are all world-class.      Hong Kong Island, with its glistening skyscrapers and high-end shopping malls, is in many ways the heartbeat of the city. Get down to street level, however, and the laneways, wet markets and traditional Chinese haunts are a reminder that beyond the city lies a working class populace still making ends meet the old fashioned way – and often the hard way.      It’s also worth remembering, of course, that there’s far more to Hong Kong than the city itself. Its natural attractions include hiker-friendly ranges, volcanic landscapes, pristine woodlands, sleepy islands, protected marine parks and miles of golden beaches.","Hong Kong  Attractions in Hong Kong  Central Plaza  The impressive Central Plaza (www.centralplaza.com.hk) is 78-stories high. Visitors can view the city from the Sky Lobby on its 46th floor. After 1800 each day, neon rooftop lights change colour every hour to denote the time.  Chi Lin Nunnery  Take a relaxing stroll around the Chi Lin Nunnery, a modern complex built in a spectacular Tang Dynasty style; continue across a footbridge to the pleasant Nan Lian Gardens. To see Hong Kong's only historic pagoda, head for the Tsui Shing Lau Pagoda, which was built in 1486 in the Yuen Lang district.  Disneyland Hong Kong  At Disneyland Hong Kong (www.hongkongdisneyland.com), on Lantau Island, visitors can meet characters old and new, from Mickey Mouse to Buzz Lightyear, and can tour the park aboard the Hong Kong Disneyland Railroad. It’s small by Disneyland standards, but attractions range from the Jungle River Cruise of Adventureland to the rollercoasters in Tomorrowland.  Dragon's Back  Walk along the Dragon's Back on the south side of Hong Kong Island, which follows a ridge and gives spectacular views. It takes about two hours to complete, and isn’t too challenging. Start at the To Tei Wan Shuen bus stop, and finish with dinner in one of the restaurants in Shek O Village.  Flagstaff House Museum of Tea Ware  An imposing colonial-style building in Hong Kong Park, the Flagstaff House Museum of Tea Ware houses ancient Chinese artefacts used in tea-making. Dating from 1846, the building is the former residence of the colonial Commander-in-Chief, and the oldest surviving colonial building in Hong Kong. For more information, contact the tourist board for details of classes held in the tea shop next door.  Happy Valley Racecourse  Vast sums of money change hands at Hong Kong's horse-racing meetings, held from September to June on Wednesday evenings (around 1900-2300). The easiest racecourse to access is Happy Valley (www.happyvalleyracecourse.com), which is on a tram route on Hong Kong Island. There is another racecourse in the New Territories, in Sha Tin (www.sha-tin.com).  Hong Kong Park  A popular escape from the busy city streets, Hong Kong Park includes plenty of green space as well as an aviary, fountains, a restaurant and the Hong Kong Visual Arts Centre. On Wednesday mornings at 0800 there are organised birdwatching sessions starting from the artificial lake; these are cancelled when there’s a cyclone warning of level 3 or above.  Kowloon Walled City Park  This park and garden were developed on the site of an old fort with a fascinating history. Built by the Chinese after the British first took Hong Kong, the fort did not surrender when Kowloon became part of British territory. It remained a semi-autonomous community until the Japanese tore down the walls during World War II, after which it was squatted. Today, the park includes a small museum with photographs of the old walled city.  Lamma Island  One of the most pleasant of Hong Kong’s outlying islands (along with Cheung Chau and Lantau Islands). The best reason to visit Lamma Island is to explore its car-free pathways, although the very good seafood restaurants in Sok Kwu Wan are arguably more popular. The beaches draw crowds too at weekends, although pollution makes swimming inadvisable.  MacLehose Trail  Head across the New Territories on Hong Kong's longest hike, the 100km-long (62-mile) MacLehose Trail. Although some people do it in one exhausting go, as on the annual Oxfam Trailwalker fundraising event, it has been split into ten sections each taking from 90 minutes to five hours. Along the way it takes on Hong Kong's highest peak, Tai Mo Shan (985m/3,231ft).   Macau  Not part of the Hong Kong at all, but another Special Autonomous Region which was returned to China by Portugal in 1999, Macau is a very popular destination for day trips and weekend breaks. Locals and mainland Chinese are, on the whole, most interested in the casinos (as there are none in Hong Kong), but there are also some delightful older parts of the enclave (which is actually two islands which were artificially joined).  Man Mo Temple  One of Hong Kong’s oldest Chinese temples, Man Mo honours the gods of literature (Man) and war (Mo). It’s an atmospheric spot in a busy part of town, with large spirals of incense hanging overhead. While in the area, browse through the bric-a-brac shops and street market on Hollywood Road and Upper Lascar Row (known as ‘Cat Street’).  Mong Kok  Thought to be the world's most densely populated urban area, Mong Kok provides the ultimate opportunity to mingle with the crowds. Exotic fish and amphibians are sold at the Goldfish Market, and intricate bamboo birdcages and songbirds can be purchased near the Yuen Po Street Bird Garden.  Ngong Ping 360 and Tian Tan Buddha  The 5.7km-long (3.5-mile) Ngong Ping 360 cable car (www.np360.com.hk) is one of the top attractions on Lantau Island, travelling between Tung Chung town centre and Ngong Ping. It offers stunning views across North Lantau Country Park and Tung Ching Bay, as well as of the giant Tian Tan Bhudda statue. Part of the development is Ngong Ping Village, a small theme park incorporating family-friendly attractions such as Walking with Buddha, the Monkey's Tale Theatre, the Ngong Ping Tea House and several dining, retail and entertainment outlets. The Po Lin Monastery, also at the top, is also likely to be interesting to most visitors.  Repulse Bay  The pristine beach at Repulse Bay is one of the most popular on the southern coast of Hong Kong Island, and on sunny weekends it can get extremely busy. To get away from the crowds walk to Middle Bay or South Bay. Alternatively, visit the Tin Hau Temple, which overlooks Repulse Bay. Another good beach destination is Cheung Sha, a white sandy beach on Lantau Island, which has the awe-inspiring Shek Pik Reservoir Dam. One-day island-hopping tickets allow unlimited ferry trips between islands.  Sai Kung country parks  The excellent country parks at Sai Kung East and West, in the New Territories, are home to macaque monkeys, wild boar, civet cats, barking deer and the Chinese pangolin. Sai Kung Town, the nearest settlement and a former fishing village, is known for its seafood restaurants. For birdwatching, try the Mai Po marshes near Yuen Long  (www.wwf.org.hk/eng/maipo), while visitors can look out for the Chinese pink dolphin near Lantau Island.  Shopping  Go shopping down bustling Nathan Road in Kowloon. Grab a bargain at Stanley Market. In Yau Ma Tei, stalls set up at 1400 on Temple Street for the Night Market, selling everything from electrical goods to incense sticks.  St John’s Cathedral  Observe glimpses of Hong Kong's colonial past at St John's Cathedral, thought to be the oldest Christian church in the Far East. Other vestiges of the colonial era can be found at Government House, the residence of 25 British governors from 1855 until Hong Kong's handover to China in 1997 (www.ceo.gov.hk/gh/eng). It is closed to the public except on an annual open day.  Swimming  Hong Kong has over 30 highly acclaimed beaches. Excellent snorkelling, waterskiing, sailing, kayaking, windsurfing, and fishing are available. Watersports equipment can be hired from beaches and hotels in Stanley and Sai Kung. One-day island-hopping tickets allow unlimited ferry trips between islands.  Ten Thousand Buddhas Monastery  The Ten Thousand Buddhas Monastery, in the New Territories hills above Sha Tin, houses around 13,000 small Buddha statues. Also in the New Territories, amble around a beautifully designed complex, located in Tuen Mun, which features pavilions, bonsai trees, lotus ponds and a Taoist temple.  Tolo Harbour Cycling Track  For an easy ride through scenic countryside, cycle on the Tolo Harbour Cycling Track, running from Sha Tin to Tai Po. Bikes are available for hire near KCR stations. Most outlying islands do not allow cars.  Victoria Harbour  The green and white tub-shaped Star Ferry (www.starferry.com.hk) vessels have been a familiar sight around Hong Kong since the 1920s and are a much-cherished symbol of the city. Far more important, however, is the fact that their decks give one of the best available and most affordable views, day or night, of the waterfronts of Hong Kong Island and Kowloon – not to mention the plethora of ocean traffic surging through the shipping lanes.  Victoria Peak  The view of Hong Kong from Victoria Peak (www.thepeak.com.hk) is a must-see, and the journey up on the Peak Tram from Garden Road is no less spectacular. At the top, visitors will find the seven-storey Peak Tower, which is a good vantage point. Alternatively, go for a wander along the various roads, including one up to the very top, and the steep Old Peak Road down to Central in around 40 minutes.  Wong Tai Sin Temple  The ornately decorated Wong Tai Sin Temple, located in Kowloon, combines Buddhist, Confucian and Taoist traditions. The temple is spectacularly colourful with its red pillars, golden ceiling and decorated latticework, and attracts around three million visitors per year. Arguably more interesting than the building itself are the fortune-tellers in their arcade of booths.",asia,china,
japan,"From kimono-clad geishas singing traditional songs in Kyoto to manga-crazed teenagers whizzing around Akihabara 'Electric Town' in Tokyo, Japan is a fascinating land of contrasts, a heady mix of tradition and modernity that often bewilders but never bores.      Nowhere in the world blends the old and new quite like Japan. The speed of new technological developments here is matched only by the longevity of its ancient customs and traditions. The country is a pioneer in the fields of design, technology and fashion. You can set your watch by the trains, eat meals that look like works of contemporary art and relieve yourself in the most technologically advanced toilets on the planet (some even talk to you).      Paradoxically, Japan's embrace of the cutting edge is offset by its revered cultural traditions and celebrated historic achievements. Ancient castle ruins, atmospheric Shinto shrines and fascinating festivals are never far away, with cultural highlights including the striking Osaka Castle and Kyoto's iconic Temple of the Golden Pavilion. There's also evidence of Japan's dramatic recent history in cities like Hiroshima and Nagasaki, where nuclear bombs were dropped with devastating consequences during WWII.      If you love nature, you will adore Japan. This is a country swathed in natural beauty. Ski the powdery slopes of Hokkaido, revel in the springtime beauty of the 'sakura' cherry blossoms, frolic in the sun-drenched beaches and turquoise waters of subtropical Okinawa, or climb up the iconic Mount Fuji. Wherever you go, good food is guaranteed – from fresh sushi and sashimi to charcoal-fired meats and sizzling sauces; Japan is a joy for gastronomes.      It is also a land of wild eccentricities, where you can watch men strip at the festival of Hadaka Matsuri or get amorous in one of the country's many short-stay love hotels. These facets might jar somewhat with Japan's polished image, but they help make it one of the most exciting destinations on the planet.","Japan  Attractions in Japan  Cherry blossom parties  From April through May, sakura (cherry blossom trees) start blooming across the country, and lively parties are held underneath the pretty blossoms. Known as a Hanami party, friends and family gather for a picnic with food and drinks. The best places include the Ueno Park and Yoyogi Park in Tokyo, the historic neighbourhood of Gion in Kyoto, and the Himeji Castle in Himeji.  Himeji, Himeji Castle  Himeji-jo is Japan's most impressive castle. Dating from the 17th century, it survived WWII bombings and is still in excellent condition. Dominated by a towering six-storey central donjon, Shirasagi-jō (or ""white egret castle"" as it is nicknamed) is supposed to resemble the shape of the bird in flight. In 1993 it was added to UNESCO's World Heritage list.  Hiroshima  Destroyed by the world's first atomic bomb on 6 August 1945, Hiroshima today promotes peace and tolerance. The vast Peace Memorial Park, home to a couple of museums and many monuments, is where most visitors spend a good day or two visiting. Worthy sites within the park include the Peace Memorial Museum (which traces deaths and sufferings following the bombing) and the A-Bomb Dome (remnants of the Hiroshima Prefectural Industrial Promotion Hall).  Hiroshima, Miyajima Island  Just off the coast of Hiroshima is the picturesque island of Miyajima – the name means 'Shrine Island' and accordingly, it is home to many shrines and temples, including the Itsukushima Shrine with the famous Torii gate that seems to float on the sea at high tide. Another famous temple on the island is Daishō-in, a holy site of Shingon Buddhism. Other attractions include the Museum of History, Miyajima Aquarium and Mount Misen – accessible by cable car and a network of walking trails.  Hokkaido  For a long time, this northern island was Japan's Wild West, and it still retains a distinct pioneer feel. Hokkaido is also home to Japan's indigenous Ainu people with a unique language, religion and culture. If you're short on time, visit the National Ainu Museum in Shiraoi, 90km (56mi) south of Sapporo.  Hot springs  When the Japanese want to relax, they head to a natural hot spring resort called onsen. Famous soaks include Dogo in Matsuyama – even the Imperial Family comes to one of the bathhouses here, and Ibusuki, renowned for its hot-sand saunas on the southern tip of Kyushu.  Kagawa, Naoshima  Situated in the Seto Inland Sea, Naoshima is about halfway between Kobe and Hiroshima. Originally a fishing port, it is now home to an exciting array of outdoor art exhibits and contemporary art museums, including one that functions as a hotel. Old houses on the island have also been converted into exhibition spaces.  Kii Peninsula, Kumano Kodo trail  The Kii Peninsula is a vast area of stunning natural beauty blessed with sacred forests, towering waterfalls, and soothing hot springs. The area is crisscrossed with a network of ancient pilgrimage trails known as Kumano Kodo, which is a key part of the region's UNESCO designation.  Kyoto  Don't miss Kyoto, the imperial capital of Japan for over 1,000 years. Founded in 794, Kyoto's best sights include the Golden Pavilion (Kinkakuji), the trail with 10,000 Torii gates at Fushimi Inari Shrine and the Nijo Castle. The historic Gion geisha district also makes for a wonderful late afternoon wander.  Kyoto, International Manga Museum  The Kyoto International Manga Museum, housed in an old primary school, is the first in the world devoted to Japanese manga comics. The museum has a massive collection, both historical and contemporary, as well as international editions of Japanese comics. Visitors can take the comics off the shelf and read them in one of the many reading spaces.  Nara  One-hour south of Kyoto, Nara was the first imperial capital of Japan and marked the far eastern end of the Silk Road. Today, it is famed for its many temples (notably Tōdaiji Temple and Horyuji Temple), ancient rituals and festivals including the Wakakusa Yamayaki fire festival, and the large Nara Park where hundreds of deer roam freely.  Osaka  Osaka is renowned for its abundance of world-class restaurants, a historic castle (an excellent reproduction of the original) and the performing arts of kabuki (classical Japanese dance and drama) and bunraku (traditional puppet theatre). The city's Dotonbori area is particularly vibrant after dark, and its aquarium shouldn't be missed either – it is one of the largest in the world.  Skiing  Come winter, do as many Japanese do and hit the slopes. Mountains here are sprinkled with top-class ski resorts, especially in the central Japanese Alps and Hokkaido, where pistes are famed for their powdery snow. Many resorts also have on-site onsen (hot springs) for guests to relax in after a fun day on the mountain.  Sumo wrestling  Watch the theatre of a sumo contest. Witnessing sumo wrestling is an exciting and truly traditional Japanese experience. Six major tournaments are held throughout the year in Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya and Fukuoka. Tickets can be purchased in advance or on the day.  Tokyo  Japan's capital is also the world's most populous metropolis. Tokyo offers visitors excellent entertainment, shopping and dining options, along with many museums and historic temples. Check out Akihabara for electronic items, Shibuya for underground live music venues and Harajuku for amazing cosplay culture. For a serene escape, head to Tokyo's many gardens, temples and shrines.  Tokyo, Sensō-ji Temple  Pilgrims have flocked to Sensō-ji Temple, Tokyo's most revered Buddhist sanctuary, for over 1,000 years. Originally founded in 628 to enshrine a statuette of the Kannon Bodhisattva (the Goddess of Mercy), damage from bombing raids means that today you'll find a lavish, five-storey reconstruction. Walk under its giant lantern to reveal smoking incense, swirling crowds and teeming shops.  Tokyo, Studio Ghibli  If you're a fan of animated films, head to the Ghibli Museum of Miyazaki Hayao's Studio Ghibli and see many of the famous characters produced by the studio, including characters from My Neighbor Totoro, Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away, along with a life-sized robot from ""Castle in the Sky"" in the rooftop garden.  Traditional Japanese tea ceremony  Arrange to take part in a traditional tea ceremony. The elegant ritual takes place in a chashitsu, a tranquil room designed and designated for tea. Kyoto and Uji (a city between Kyoto and Nara) are two excellent destinations to enjoy the country's tea culture.  Whale and dolphin watching  Several former whaling ports have turned into active whale watching communities with enthusiastic operators taking tour groups out to spot humpback and sperm whales. For the best chance of seeing these incredible mammals, take to the seas between January and March. Dolphin watching is also popular in eastern and western Japan.  Ōno District, Gassho-zukuri farmhouses  In the mountains of central Japan, you'll find the remote yet utterly picturesque area of Shirakawa-go. It is famed for its Gassho-zukuri farmhouses, which are charming traditional houses with high and narrow thatched roofs – said to resemble gassho (hands together in prayer). Many are still inhabited and open to the public, offering a fascinating glimpse of both traditional and modern rural life.",asia,,
antigua and barbuda,"“We have 365 beaches here – one for every day of the year.” If you were given a dollar every time you heard that in Antigua, your holiday would surely be paid for. It’s the national catchphrase and you’ll get tired of hearing it. But locals have every right to be proud of Antigua and its dashing twin, Barbuda: with their powdery beaches and swaying palms they’re the quintessence of Caribbean island idyll.      Most of the action takes place in Antigua, a glamorous island where expensive yachts float in the harbour, honeymooners frolic in the surf and scuba divers explore colourful coral reefs in crystalline waters. You can see why Giorgio Armani and Oprah Winfrey keep homes here.      Away from the glamour, there are many attractions: from steamy rainforests to historic sites such as Shirley Heights, a military lookout with views over Nelson’s Dockyard, the only working Georgian dockyard in the world.      Antigua’s highest point, Mount Obama, begs to be climbed. It’s also worth checking out the island’s national parks and billowing blowholes, such as Devil's Bridge, which are caused by the colliding surf of the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea.      The buzzing Saturday market in St Johns, the capital, is a must: pick up anything from fresh fruit to local crafts. Antigua springs to life at night, with dozens of places to party including Shirley Heights, which is the setting for Sunday night “jump ups” (street parties) featuring live music and lots of rum punch.      Antigua’s little sister Barbuda is quieter, but no less beautiful. Lying 43.5km (27 miles) to the north, its beating heart is Codrington, which is widely referred to as “The Village”. Codrington consists of only a handful of streets and offers a glimpse of Caribbean life as it used to be.      Although small, there is much to do in Barbuda. The island is a haven for wild deer and exotic birds, and is home to the Frigate Bird Sanctuary. Important Amerindian rock carvings can be found at Two foot Bay, while sumptuous beaches abound.","Antigua and Barbuda  Attractions in Antigua and Barbuda  Catch a cricket match  Cricket is played to the highest international standard here – and by legions of enthusiastic amateurs in villages all over the islands. Antigua even produced one of the finest cricketers the game has ever seen, Sir Vivien Richards. Try and catch a game at the country's national stadium in St John's, which is named after the batsman.  Challenge a local to a game of Warri  You can't avoid Antigua and Barbuda's national game of Warri – an ancient board game (also known as ""count and capture"") that was traditionally played using shells placed in cups: you see it played on most street corners and may even be asked to join in. A National Warri Festival is held every year.  Discover the past at the Museum of Antigua and Barbuda  Discover Antigua and Barbuda beyond the beaches and resorts by visiting the Museum of Antigua and Barbuda, Antigua's oldest building. It is held in the old Court House, built in 1750. Exhibits explore Antigua's geological origins as well as more modern exhibits such as Sir Viv Richards' cricket bat.  Enjoy a barbecue at Shirley Heights  The view from Shirley Heights extends across the harbour and out to neighbouring Caribbean islands of Montserrat and Guadeloupe. This collection of gun emplacements and military buildings is the atmospheric, rum-heavy setting for a barbecue with live steel band music every Sunday. Close by is the cemetery, containing an obelisk commemorating the soldiers of the 54th Regiment.  Explore the restored Nelson’s Dockyard  One of Antigua's most famous landmarks, Nelson's Dockyard in English Harbour, dates from 1745 and was home to Admiral Horatio Nelson until 1787. It has been lovingly restored after years of decay and today these historic buildings house a museum, craft and souvenir shop, restaurant, hotels and marina.  Feel old-fashioned in Codrington, Barbuda  Visit the less-developed Barbuda for its wild beauty, deserted beaches and heavily wooded interior abounding in wildlife. The main town, known as the village, is Codrington. It sits on the edge of a lagoon. Laid-back and old-fashioned, visitors share the winding streets with donkeys and goats, instead of fast food outlets and noisy bars.  Follow the road along Fig Tree Drive  Take Antigua's most scenic route, Fig Tree Drive. The 32km (20 miles) of winding roads travel through the lush tropical hills and rainforest and rise to the steep farmlands around Fig Tree Hill before descending to the coast. Fig is the Antiguan name for banana and along the way you'll won't just see bananas but mangoes and coconut groves too.  Get blown away by St John's Cathedral  Rebuilt three times because of hurricane damage, the present day St John's Cathedral with its dramatic white towers is an imposing landmark originally erected in 1845. It contains items from its predecessors, whilst the bronze figures of St John the Baptist and St John the Divine are thought to have be taken from a French ship in 1756.  Go wild with watersports  Antigua and Barbuda offers a seemingly endless range of watersports for those who fancy some exhilaration, including windsurfing, water skiing, surfing and jet-skiing. The island is fantastic for those who wish to snorkel and scuba dive, and with more than 365 beaches, there are plenty of places from which to launch a kayaking, hobie cat or sunfish sailboat.  Haggle at the local markets  Salivate and haggle over the riot of colourful fruits, vegetables and spices available at one of the best local markets in the Caribbean. Antigua Market is situated in the south end of town at the junction of Valley and All Saints Roads. Head there in the morning to capture the best of the bargains.  Head to Frigate Bird Sanctuary during mating season  Situated in the Codrington Lagoon, Frigate Bird Sanctuary is a 40-minute boat ride across the water. It is a spectacular sight even for non-bird watchers. During the mating season (September to April) the Frigate male displays a huge red breast to attract a female mate and they lay just one egg, in a precarious nest atop the mangroves.  Hike up to Highland House  Sitting atop Barbuda's highest point, which at just 38m-high (125ft) won't exactly give you a nosebleed, stand the crumbling ruins of Highland House. A former estate run by Sir Christopher Codrington, it's an impressive sight and offers great views without the vertigo.  Lay claim to the throne at Redonda  The deserted island of Redonda lies about 56km (35 miles) northeast of Antigua. The island is famous for its unusual monarchy (no less than four people have laid claim to the ""throne"") and it has an eccentric and amusing history and small population of burrowing owls, a bird now extinct on Antigua. Boat trips to the island are available.  Relax on one of Antigua's many beaches  There are hundreds of beaches on Antigua but some of the best include Half Moon Bay, popular with windsurfers and snorkellers. For those seeking peace and quiet, the southwestern jut off Johnson's Point is tranquil, while Turner's Beach nearby look out to onto Montserrat. For even quieter beaches sneak to uninhabited inlets such as Prickly Pear Island.  Ride a speedboat to Stingray City  A drive to the pretty fishing village of Seatons introduces visitors to the delights of interacting with rays, followed an exhilarating speed boat ride takes you to one of Antigua's off shore islands and a shallow stingray pool where one can touch, play with and feed stingrays in a safe environment.  Sail to a secluded cove  Antigua hosts many international yachting events and regattas throughout the year, but even inexperienced yachtsmen and women can take the helm. A number of hotels offer sailing lessons and experiences, while seasoned sailors can charter their own yachts. Those preferring to seek out a secluded cove and anchor for a day can do so by hiring a dinghy.  See the rock paintings at Two Foot Bay Caves  The Caves at Two Foot Bay are popular with visitors to Barbuda and are easily accessible, although a guide is recommended. Bats, crabs and tropical birds can be seen as well as petroglyphs or rock drawings made by Barbuda's early settlers, the Arawaks. Access is through a circular chamber through a hole in the cave roof.   Take the pirate ship to Great Bird Island  Take an excursion to Great Bird Island, home of the harmless Antiguan racer, from Dickenson Bay. Glass-bottomed boats afford leisurely views of the reef, and a restored pirate ship sails around the island and takes passengers for day or evening trips, with food, drink and entertainment included.  Visit Betty’s Hope, a former sugar plantation  The islands' colonial history is brought home at partially-restored Betty's Hope, Antigua's pioneer sugar plantation. The surviving structures are two stone sugar mills and a still house, which form an open-air museum and good picnic spot. Originally built by Sir Christopher Codrington, he named it after his daughter Betty.  Witness the power of the Atlantic at Indian Town Point  The wild side of Antigua can be seen at Devil’s Bridge, a limestone arch on the shore of Indian Town Point, where at high tide the Atlantic waves come crashing through boreholes in the rocks near the bridge. Indian Town Point is thought to have been an Arawak campsite before the Europeans colonised the islands.",caribbean,,
new brunswick,"Gorgeous coastline, the world’s highest tides, sensational seafood, huge chunks of wilderness and a cosmopolitan heritage: New Brunswick is a maritime gem.      The province’s unmissable natural wonder is the Bay of Fundy, which separates New Brunswick from Nova Scotia. As well as whales, this vast bay boasts the world's highest tide and the best place to watch it is at Hopewell Rocks, a collection of tree-topped sea stacks that disappear before your eyes as the tide rises four stories in a matter of minutes.      Away from the seaside, New Brunswick offers outdoor adventure in spades. You can camp, mountain bike and ski in the Appalachian Mountains; kayak and canoe across gentle lakes and churning rapids or hook salmon the size of small dogs on the Mirimachi River.      Not surprisingly for a province more than half-wrapped in coastline, New Brunswick’s seafood is pretty special. Delve into platefuls of oyster soup, lobster stew, or anything flavoured with dulse, a type of edible seaweed.      New Brunswickers love to show off their heritage; English, Scots, Irish and French have all made their mark here. You might stumble upon bagpipers giving it laldy at a Scottish Highland Games or find yourself tapping your toes to a barnstorming Irish dance performance. Middle Island Heritage Park recounts the sobering story of immigrants fleeing the potato famine who were quarantined on this island, many of whom never made it off.      Nearly a third of New Brunswickers are French speakers, so dust off your dictionary and get chatting to New Brunswick’s Acadians. The Village Historique Acadien is jam-packed with costumed characters guiding you through their history, but you can have just as much fun nattering in an Acadian village bar with a glass of the local vino.","New Brunswick  Attractions in New Brunswick  Be charmed by Fredericton  The capital, Fredericton, is known for 19th-century architecture such as the Legislative Building, Christ Church Cathedral and Government House. The Beaverbrook Art Gallery has an extensive collection of Canadian, British and Renaissance paintings, a highlight being Salvador Dali's St James the Great.  Catch a juicy salmon  With 3,814km (19,884 miles) of rivers and streams, New Brunswick is a popular destination for anglers. The Miramichi River, in particular, is famous for salmon fishing. Deep-sea fishing boats are available for charter.  Cross record-breaking bridges  New Brunswick is home to 62 pretty and quirky, historic covered bridges. Particularly famous is the Hartland Covered Bridge, which at 391m (1282 ft) is the longest covered bridge in the world.  Digging for natives  The aboriginal town of Metepenagiag (Red Bank First Nation), just outside the town of Miramichi, is worth a visit. It's New Brunswick's oldest town, with archaeological finds that date back more than 3,000 years.  Follow the lighthouses like beacons  New Brunswick's picturesque lighthouses, which have safeguarded the maritime province for decades, are great lunch spots. Some lovely ones to have a picnic beside include Cocagne Lighthouse, Cape Enrage Light Station, Quaco Head Lighthouse and Richibucto Head Lighthouse.  Go swimming in the sea  The province's beaches are renowned for their warm water (they are among the warmest north of Virginia). There are over 40 public swimming beaches, notably Parlee Beach (a provincial park) and Kellys Beach (in Kouchibouguac National Park).  Journey back in time at St Andrews  St Andrews has some well-preserved 18th-century houses as well as The Blockhouse, built during the War of 1812 to defend the town from US incursions.  Learn about the birds and bees  Beautiful rare flora and fauna draw visitors to the unspoilt Fundy Islands, of which birdwatching paradise Grand Manan was once a favourite haunt of the famous ornithologist John James Audubon.  Marvel at the Reversing Falls  The Reversing Falls in Saint John are a natural phenomenon caused by the powerful tidal waters of the Bay of Fundy, which has the world's highest tides, rising and falling 15m (50ft) twice a day. Dramatic scenery created by the tides includes Hopewell Cape's sandstone 'flowerpots'.  Paddle between the Hopewell Rocks  Kayakers often head to the Bay of Fundy, where they can paddle between the gravity-defying rocks of Hopewell Cape. For those who wish to engage in some canoeing, New Brunswick's many rivers are an ideal location to do so.  Something for the kids  An invisible force seems to pull your car uphill at Moncton, the province's largest city (it recently surpassed Saint John in population). Magnetic Hill is actually an optical illusion. Other family entertainments are provided at the Magic Mountain Water Park and Crystal Palace Amusement Park.  Sunbathe on the eastern shoreline  The temperate eastern shoreline has excellent beaches, particularly near Kouchibouguac National Park, where boardwalks protect the fragile dune ecology; southeast of the park, La Dune de Bouctouche, a white sand dune, has an eco-visitor centre. Parlee Beach is one of the province's largest beaches.  Walk the International Appalachian Trail  New Brunswick has a vast network of walking, hiking and biking trails, including the International Appalachian Trail, linking with the US trail at Mount Katahdin; Le Petit Temis, which stretches from Edmundston to Rivière-du-Loup in Québec; the Fundy Trail Parkway; and the Acadian Coastal Trail.  Watch out for whales  Whale-watching tours abound off New Brunswick's coastline: the province boasts more sightings than anywhere else in the world. The Bay of Fundy is home to over 15 species, including the rare right whale. Departure points for tours include Campobello Island, Grand Manan and St Andrews.",north america,canada,
turkey,"For sheer diversity, Turkey (officially the Republic of Türkiye) is hard to beat. The country is best measured in multitudes – of people, natural landscapes and cultures. It is a land of vast open spaces and massive mountain ranges, fertile valleys and rugged coastline, fast-growing cities and sleepy villages, seaside resorts and remote beaches.      Countless waves of invasion, rebellion and immigration have forged a country whose cultural depth and breadth may surprise visitors as they venture not just through major cities, but across the country.      Turkey overflows with historic sites and archaeological wonders, all set in a varied and beautiful landscape. The Mediterranean coastline is punctuated with well-preserved Greco-Roman cities like Pergamom and Ephesus, while the otherworldly landscapes of the Cappadocia region harbour cave churches and underground cities.      Though capital status eludes it, Istanbul is very much the beating heart of the nation. The city is an archive of cultural influences throughout the centuries, playing host to Roman aqueducts, Byzantine churches and Ottoman mosques and palaces. Yet it’s no relic. Cafes, bustling bazaars, hammams (public baths), and nightclubs all buzz with activity.      Still, Istanbul is just one piece of the vast Turkish puzzle. Beach-lovers can while away lazy sunny days at the ever-popular Bodrum, Marmaris and Izmir resorts along Turkey’s Aegean and Mediterranean coasts.      The unlikely capital city, Ankara, may be less frequented, but its location in central Anatolia makes it worthy of a few days’ visit, if only to witness the contrast between the city’s modernity and the surviving citadel. Away from the more European sensibilities of Istanbul, Ankara also presents an opportunity to gain insight into other facets of Turkish culture.      However deep its roots are, Turkey is today a thrusting and dynamic society, navigating cultural, economic and political change while seeking to retain the best of its multicultural heritage and time-honoured traditions. And that's arguably what makes it so rewarding.","Turkey  Attractions in Turkey  Be dazzled by the Whirling Dervishes  The renowned Whirling Dervishes are one of Turkey's most iconic tourist attractions. Members of the Mevlevi Order perform the famous whirling dance known as Sema as part of an aged ceremony. It's best seen in Konya where the Order originated, though many shows catering to visitors are put on in Istanbul, too.  Cruise down the Black Sea  Explore the northern suburbs of Istanbul by ferry-boat, criss-crossing the Bosphorus to visit villages that stretch up to the mouth of the Black Sea. You can escape the tourists further and join holidaying Turks at one of the small Black Sea coast towns like Ünye or Giresun – less crowded, cooler and greener than the Mediterranean coast.  Detour to the capital, Ankara  The Turkish capital is overlooked by many visitors but has some excellent museums. The superb Museum of Anatolian Civilisations provides a rich chronicle on the dynamic history of the region, while the Ethnographic Museum in Ankara provides a great insight into Turkish culture.  Discover caves and bazaars in Sanliurfa  Wander through a traditional bazaar at Sanliurfa in the southeast, close to the Syrian border, and pay a visit to the cave where Abraham is said to have been born. Since the conflict in Syria, the border has become less secure, and caution is advised.  Explore the Kaçkar mountains  Go trekking in the wild Kaçkar mountain range of Turkey's northeast, close to the Georgian frontier. Take a trail through dense pine forests and scenic pastures, before hitting heights of almost 4,000m (13,123 ft). Routes across higher altitudes are only open during the summer months unless trekkers are equipped for snowy weather.  Explore the beaches of Bodrum  Although home to one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World – the Mausoleum of Mausolus – Bodrum in Turkey's southwest is perhaps better known today as the country's finest Aegean resort. Dominated by the Castle of St John, the town is renowned for its shopping, dining and nightlife, not to mention its sweeping sandy beaches.  Get some water therapy  The incredible pools at Pamukkale near Denizli attract tourists and locals alike who come to bathe in the warm therapeutic waters that fill the natural travertine terraces. The pools, together with the ancient ruins of the city of Hierapolis nearby have been declared a World Heritage Site.  Glide over the dreamland of Cappadocia  Formed after the eruption of Mount Erciyes and fashioned by nature over the ages, Cappadocia offers an unrivalled landscape of rock cones, sprawling pinnacles and gaping ravines. Only many years later did the human touch arrive, providing tourists with cave houses and underground tunnels to explore. Hot-air balloon rides over the area are very popular.  Go white-water rafting  White-water rafting is becoming increasingly popular with tourists in Turkey. There are trips going down the Dalaman River, the Köprülü River, the Zamanti River or the Coruh River, which is rated by professionals as one of the top rafting descents in the world. Hold on tight!  Hit the southern coastal town of Antalya  Not much known in the West, Antalya is nevertheless one of the most-visited cities in the world. Sitting on the Mediterranean and Turkey's southern coast, it's not hard to see why with its vast beaches, lively nightlife and atmospheric old town. Then there's the harbour, Kaleiçi, and the superb Archaeological Museum, as well as many historic sights throughout the city, not least Hadrian's Gate.  Hop on a boat through Lake Van  Use the eastern city of Van as a base to travel along the beautiful south shore of Lake Van. From there you can catch a boat out to the 10th-century Armenian church on Akdamar island, famous for its intricate stone reliefs depicting biblical scenes.  Search for Noah on Mount Ararat  Look for fragments of Noah's Ark, reputed to have washed up on the slopes of 5,165m (16,945ft) Mount Ararat in Turkey's eastern region. Apart from the biblical appeal, the snow-capped mountain is an incredible sight, visible from many kilometres away. Only authorised trekking companies are recommended for scaling mighty Ararat.  Sumela Monastery  Before Ottoman rule, much of Anatolia was home to Greek settlements. One spectacular example is the 14th-century Greek Orthodox Sumela Monastery, 54km (34 miles) from Trabzon. Set into a sheer cliff, 300m (1,000ft) above the valley floor, it's a jaw-dropping sight. The inside is filled with magnificent frescoes.  Take a ferry to Prince's Islands  Sip tea or smoke shisha as you watch the sunset at one of the traditional cafés beneath Istanbul's Galata Bridge. Then take a ferry from the Eminönü dock to the Princes' Islands, a tranquil summer getaway popular with Istanbulites where cars are banned and horse-drawn carriages and bicycles are the transport of choice.  Trek the Lycian Way  Turkey isn't touted much for its hiking, but it has some great, uncrowded routes. One of the most beautiful is the Lycian Way, which stretches for 500km (311 miles) between Fethiye and Antalya, providing a month's walking through some of Turkey's most spectacular scenery.  Walk with historical giants in Istanbul's Old City  Once the capital of Byzantium – the greatest empire in Christendom during the Middle Ages – Constantinople became Istanbul after the Ottoman conquest of the 15th century, and has been an Islamic metropolis ever since. Its architectural treasures include the Blue Mosque, the Topkapi Palace and Hagia Sophie.  Wind down in a Turkish bath  You can't visit Turkey without experiencing a traditional Turkish bath. Known as a hammam, locals go for a scrub and massage, as well as a good steam. The most popular historic baths in Istanbul are the Galatasaray Hammam in Beyoğlu and Cağaloğlu Hammam in Sultanahmet, though less-known local baths are often just as good.",europe,,
jamaica,"The famous birthplace of Bob Marley, reggae and the Rastafari movement, Jamaica’s cultural offering to the world is far greater than its size might suggest. With varying degrees of success, beach resorts around the world have attempted to emulate the Jamaican seaside vibe, but once you’ve felt the sand between your toes on this Caribbean island, you’ll accept no substitutes.      But it’s so much more than a beach destination. Beyond the swaying palms and white sands lie misty coffee plantations, the epic Blue Mountains, raging rivers prime for rafting and forests alive with exotic species. It’s not all wild. Manicured parks and gardens are a Jamaican speciality, and you can spot exuberant clusters of tropical blooms on any street corner of this fertile island.      At the heart of it all, though, is music. From bass-heavy beats pumping out of Kingston’s frenetic nightclubs to harmonious choirs singing in village churches, it is in the air wherever you go. If song satisfies Jamaica’s sensual needs, food and drink tend to its soul. Culinary delights range from gourmet seafood in award-winning restaurants to street-side jerk chicken washed down with a chilled can of Red Stripe. You can taste some of the world’s best rum and coffee here, not to mention a sumptuous range of tropical fruits.      Negril and Montego Bay are Jamaica’s two main coastal resorts, with exquisite sands, lively clubs, fine restaurants and world-class golf. And then there’s Kingston, the island’s spirited capital and home of the island’s music scene, where grand Georgian plazas and elegant mansions are serenaded by soca rhythms and the pulsating buzz of the city. Sleepy fishing villages offer a glimpse of Jamaica’s quieter side, but ultimately, whether it’s high-octane adventure or slow travel you’re looking for, you’ll soon be seduced by the rhythm of life on this irresistible island.","Jamaica  Attractions in Jamaica  Admire Shaw Park’s floral splendours  Jamaica is world famous for its landscaped gardening, so if you want to see some vibrant blooms check out Shaw Park Botanical Gardens, a 10-hectare (25-acre) collection of exotic Caribbean flora, which includes bougainvillea and hibiscus, the national flower. Situated on a hilltop with great views over Ocho Rios and the Caribbean Sea, the gardens' centrepiece is a waterfall, tumbling through banks of flowers.  Dip into Milk River Spa  Take a rejuvenating dip in the curative waters of the Milk River, which feeds a government-owned spa nearby. Discovered in 1794, these spring-fed therapeutic waters reach temperatures of 33°C (86°F), relieving ailments such as arthritis and lumbago.  Discover Treasure Bay  This isolated oasis comprises three golden sandy bays on the south of the island, where palm fronds sway, azure waters lap, and local fisherman sail their colourful boats to fish amongst the cays on the horizon. Far from the package tour circuit, this is the Jamaican paradise you saw in the brochure before you came.  Dive into the underwater gardens  Jamaica's coast is lined with some magical underwater gardens, featuring sunken wrecks, black coral and rope sponge, hosting a multitude of multi-coloured tropical fish. One of the best is Montego Bay Marine Park, located along the west and north coasts. Montego Bay's waters are protected, and, amidst its caverns and reefs, you can spot nurse sharks, eagle rays, jellyfish, tobacco fish and snapper.  Explore the backcountry villages  Hundreds of trails connect the villages and settlements in Jamaica's mountainous interior, including several utilitarian paths around Newcastle on the Kingston to Buff Bay Road, where trails lead to Catherine's Peak and Mount Horeb. Cockpit Country, in the northwest, has some fascinating historic routes, but be sure to go with a guided group, as paths are not well sign-posted.  Follow in the footsteps of Columbus  Showcasing relics of Jamaican history, Columbus Park is a commemorative park near Discovery Bay that marks the 1494 landing of Christopher Columbus. Only opened in 2014, the small gardens features historic exhibits such as an old locomotive, aqueduct and a replica of a Taino canoe.  Get smart in Kingston  The reputation of the Jamaican capital may include street crime and edgy shantytowns, but for a real insight into its island life nowhere else will do. Stay smart and you'll enjoy a fascinating and authentic experience encompassing grand historical sights, a beautiful harbour-front, frenetic markets and pulsating nightlife.  Go on a Bob Marley pilgrimage  Jamaica's most famous export is reggae and nobody on the island has done more to popularise this genre of music than Bob Marley. He lived in a modest wooden house at 56 Hope Road in Kingston, which has become something of a shrine to the dreadlocked star. Marley recorded some of his best-loved tracks at this address, which now serves as a museum and pilgrimage site for music fans.  Hike up the Blue Mountains  Follow one of many hiking and climbing trails up the Blue Mountains to heights above 2,100m (7,000ft). The stunning landscape ranges from gently sloping coffee plantations to dwarf cloud forest fringing the peak. Shrouded by mists that give the peaks their bluish tinge, the Blue Mountains are home to more than 200 bird species and 800 species of plants.  Party all night in Montego Bay  Chill out or party hard Jamaican-style in Montego Bay, the island's most buzzing city. Whether you lounge all day on Doctor's Cave Beach or cruise through the gaudy delights of Gloucester, you'll be joining the crowds in Jamaica's biggest mass tourism destination. Once you've sampled its treats you may not make it any further.  Peer over Lover's Leap  A sheer 518m (1,700ft) cliff overhanging Cutlass Bay on the south coast, Lover's Leap was named after two slave lovers, Mizzy and Tunkey, who chose to jump to their deaths rather than be separated. If you get vertigo, stand well away from the edge – the view is terrifying. A statue of the ill-fated couple stands on the cliff-top.  Raft the Rio Grande  Explore one of Jamaica's largest rivers with a leisurely ride through banana and sugar cane plantations on a bamboo raft originally used to transport the crop down to Port Antonio. Set off along the Rio Grande, from the peaks of the Blue Mountains at Berrydale before winding down through the tropical vegetation to St Margaret's Bay.  Shimmy to Soca at Carnival  Take to the streets to witness Jamaica's riotous fun-filled Bacchanal Carnival, held annually in Kingston. Parading musicians, skimpily dressed dancers and floats typify this world famous street party, which starts in January, building up to the Road March and Parade after Easter. Expect outlandish behaviour to the sounds of Soca, steel bands and beating drums.  Spelunk through limestone caves  Check out a huge labyrinth of limestone caves on Jamaica's north coast, a stunning natural phenomenon characterised by stalactites, stalagmites, overhead crags, tunnels, light holes and a subterranean lake. The Green Grotto was once used as shelter by the Arawak Indians (Tainos), Jamaica's now extinct original inhabitants. You can join a guided tour from nearby Ocho Rios or Montego Bay.  Sun and fun in Negril  You can find Jamaica's finest beaches in Negril on the western coast. This laid-back town is renowned for its gorgeous sunsets and its beautiful Seven Mile Beach (roughly 11km/7 miles) with aqua blue water and white sand. The coral reefs and caves along the coast attract scuba divers and snorkelers, while the brave ones may indulge in extreme sports such as jumping off 12m (40ft) bluffs.  Swim with dolphins and sharks  With its backdrop of tropical rainforest, Dolphin Cove in Ocho Rios is Jamaica's largest natural lagoon, home to numerous bottlenose dolphins. Interacting and swimming with these magical creatures is sure to be one of your most unforgettable experiences in Jamaica. And if that's not enough of a thrill, you can also mingle with sharks and stingrays.  Tour historical Spanish Town  Stroll around the ancient streets of Spanish Town, Jamaica's former capital, on a historical walking tour. Under Spanish rule for over 200 years, it was once a magnificent and impressive metropolis. Some fine stately redbrick homes and grand monuments remain, including a resplendent plaza, Anglican cathedral and the magnificent Old King's House mansion.  Uncover Port Royal, Jamaica’s old capital  If you're fascinated by Jamaica's swashbuckling past, pay a visit to Port Royal, which is located at the mouth of Kingston Harbour. This fishing village was once a centre for rum-swilling privateers, who would spend their ill-gotten gains in the local inns. An earthquake in 1692 destroyed much of Port Royal, alas, but the village is still home to a number of historic buildings, which allow visitors a peek into the past.",caribbean,,
madeira,"The “Pearl of the Atlantic,” Madeira is more than just a shortcut to the tropics for European holidaymakers. A land of luscious mountains, limpid lagoons and gorgeous fishing villages, this Portuguese archipelago is a destination of staggering natural beauty.      Floating off the coast of West Africa, Madeira’s landscapes are indebted to the rich volcanic soil, mild climate and abundant rainfall that support an exceptional diversity of flora. Botanists take particular delight in the archipelago’s laurisilva forests, which are inscribed on UNESCO’s list of World Heritage Sites.      As well as being home to exceptional flora, Madeira has spectacular fauna, with the warm Atlantic Ocean proving the perfect habitat for marine life. The ocean offers many opportunities for adventurous travellers; from swimming with dolphins to scuba diving. Whale watching and surfing are other major selling points.      Golden sandy beaches are few on Madeira, found only at Calheta and Machico, and both of those have been built from imported sand. Elsewhere beaches consist of small strips of black, volcanic sand, which is enough for some.      On land, the fragrant eucalyptus woodlands are an ideal place for hiking, offering stunning views. But perhaps the most distinctive characteristic of Madeira is its renowned system of water channels, known as levadas. Constructed by slaves to convey water from the mountains to plantations, walking the levadas has become a major tourist attraction for Madeira.      Despite the lack of beach space, Madeira remains popular with foreign visitors and its coastal resorts are geared to the demands of the modern tourist, most of which arrive via the capital, Funchal, which overlooks one of the world’s most beautiful bays. Here you can relax at one of the many cafés, order a glass of Madeira wine and let the archipelago’s charms work their magic; you won't be disappointed.","Madeira  Attractions in Madeira  Admire the architecture in Santana  Santana is arguably the most visited village on the island. Visitors come here to imbibe the quaint rural atmosphere and marvel at its triangular-shaped houses, or palheiros.  Climb Pico Ruivo  The island's highest peak, Pico Ruivo (1,862m/6,109ft) can be reached in under an hour via a paved path from a parking area to the north (Achada do Texeiro), and, not surprisingly, offers spectacular views. Even easier to conquer is the third-highest peak, Pico do Arieiro (1,818m/5,965ft) – it's road all the way, with a bar, restaurant and gift shop at the top.  Go whale watching  The deep waters around Madeira offer some of the best whale watching in the region. The archipelago was once an important outpost for the deadly whaling industry, but since a moratorium on hunting the mammals in 1981, the waters are once again teeming with whales – and dolphins. Tours depart from various locations throughout Madeira.  Hike along the levadas  The levadas are a network of ancient irrigation channels stretching some 2,150km (1335 miles) across the island's slopes from the north of the island. Today, while they continue to provide water to remote valleys, they also represent a supply of ready-made walkways for tourists.  Pilgrimage to Nossa Senhora de Monte  The cable car from Funchal to Monte leads to the Nossa Senhora de Monte church. On 15 August, it becomes a centre of pilgrimage when worshippers climb the 74 steps on their hands and knees.  Quaff Madeira wine  Madeira is renowned for its fortified wines: Malvasia, Bual, Verdelho and Sercial. Most countries limit the use of the term 'Madeira' to wines that come from the island of Madeira, to which the European Union grants Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) status. The island also produces a light, white, table wine (Vinho Verde), which is superb with salads, and is increasingly producing red table wines in the north of the island. The famous Madeira Wine Festival takes place annually in September.  Take a toboggan  Originally used as a speedy means of descent for villagers, toboggans are today mainly used to carry tourists. Driven by two men (carreiros) dressed in white, with straw hats and black rubber boots that are used as brakes, they use ropes to control the wide, two-person wicker baskets which are mounted on wooden runners. Runs start in Monte (accessible by cable car) and descend rapidly to Livramento, a suburb of Funchal.  Tee off for a leisurely round  There are three fine golf courses in the Madeira archipelago: the 27-hole Campo de Golfe do Santo da Serra (www.santodaserragolf.com) an 18-hole Palheiro course (www.palheirogolf.com), and Porto Santo (www.portosantogolfe.com). Construction halted in 2003 on a fourth championship golf course being built in Ponta do Pargo that was designed by famous golfer Nick Faldo.  Visit the old capital, Machico  Machico is the original capital of Madeira and is home to a magnificent 15th-century parish church, the Chapel of Miracles (a place of pilgrimage) and a small but picturesque 18th-century fort.  While away the day in Funchal  The Madeiran capital is set on a natural sweeping bay, backed by richly vegetated slopes that rise to a skyline of rugged peaks. The town is home to a remarkable 16th-century cathedral, the Museum of Sacred Art (www.museuartesacrafunchal.org) and Botanical Gardens – five hectares (12 acres) of terraced hillside, planted with species from around the globe.",europe,portugal,
us virgin islands,"The result of the US Virgin Islands' history and location is a unique blend of Danish heritage and American modernity. Add to that a dose of the relaxed and friendly attitude typical of the Caribbean, and you've pretty much got the measure of this territory. With miles of glistening beaches, first-class diving facilities and verdant tropical vegetation, there is more than enough to seduce even the pickiest of visitors.  Don't let the name fool you too much. It's true that Americans favour the islands as a beautiful haven from the mainland – it's not called 'America's Paradise' for nothing – and those from the US don't even need a passport to visit. But this isn't just an American playground.  The Danes' legacy is evident in Christiansted, on the largest island, St Croix, where historic sites include Fort Christiansværn (dating from 1774) and the Old Custom House. St Thomas too retains much of its Danish influence; in the capital, Charlotte Amalie, converted warehouses now house stylish boutiques.  Apart from exploring the interesting history of these islands, which are situated in the Caribbean Sea (not far from the equally imaginatively named British Virgin Islands), there's terrific seafood to be sampled here, as well as water sports, and of course spectacular beaches. The nightlife is buzzing, with countless bars – beach bars, wine bars, lounge bars – as well as one enormous casino. For a little in the way of high culture, head to the Reichhold Center for the Arts.  Those seeking unspoilt natural beauty should head to St John. With no airport, and two-thirds of the island's deep valleys set aside as a national park, this is an ideal retreat.  An easy, unchallenging destination, the US Virgin Islands may not be the most culturally compelling choice, but the territory promises good fun, relaxing times and a sun-kissed reprieve from the rat race.","US Virgin Islands  Attractions in US Virgin Islands  Cruise to Buck Island  Sail to the much smaller Buck Island, easily reached via the 10km (6 mile) channel that separates it from Christiansted. Offshore is one of the world's most impressive marine gardens, maintained by the National Park Service as an underwater protected reef.  Kick back in St John  Escape the crowds on St John, the most unspoiled of the islands. It has no airport, and two-thirds of the island's deep valleys and most of its shoreline have been set aside as the Virgin Islands National Park. If you're looking for a slice of local life, head to Cruz Bay, which offers excellent beaches, fantastic diving and a laidback vibe.  Marvel at the architecture  Admire the colourful colonial facades, which are a feature of the local architecture. Off particular interest to history buffs is Blackbeard's Castle, which is the earliest fortification in the US Virgin Islands. Other attractions include Fort Christian, built in 1672; the Coral World Observatory; the Frederick Lutheran Church; Government House on Government Hill; Venus Pillar on Magnolia Hill; Bluebeard's Tower, the 19th-century pirate's one-time abode.  Meet the marine life  Clear, warm waters and colourful coral reefs make the US Virgin Islands a mecca for divers. Some of the best sites include Andreas Reef (on St Thomas, known for its variety of tropical fish); Buck Island Reef National Monument (a protected area on St Croix); Carval Rock (for advanced divers, on St John); and Submarine Alley (an advanced dive site, on St Thomas).  Raise a glass of rum  Explore St Croix, the largest of the US Virgin Islands. Christiansted is one of the two major towns showing early Danish influence. Outside of Christiansted, on West Airport Road, is the Cruz Rum Distillery where visitors can taste the islands' rum. St George Village Botanical Gardens and Croix Aquarium are both worth a visit.  Set sail around the islands  Sail around the territory's myriad islands. Visitors can hire sailing boats or powerboats, with or without a skipper. Boat races take place all year round, including the Rolex Cup Regatta (on St Thomas) and the Mumm's Cup Regatta (on St Croix). Guided kayak tours through Mangrove Lagoon and St Thomas' Marine Sanctuary provide the opportunity to see egrets, herons and other wildlife.  Shop till you drop in St Thomas  Head to cosmopolitan St Thomas, the second largest of the US Virgin Islands. The main town, Charlotte Amalie, is the group's capital. Imported goods from all over the world make it a marvellous shopping centre and stores tucked into remodelled Danish warehouses line each side of the picturesque Main Street.  Take a fishing trip  Fish for blue and white marlin, sailfish and wahoo; the North Drop (accessible from St John or St Thomas) is the best-known spot. Sport fishing charters with experienced skippers are widely available. Local fishermen are keen to encourage the ""catch-and-release"" method in order to preserve fish species.",caribbean,,
djibouti,"Tucked away in the Horn of Africa, diminutive Djibouti offers ethereal landscapes, traditional tribes and mega marine life by the camel load – little wonder this slice of East Africa is being touted as the next big thing.      Refreshingly devoid of large-scale tourist developments (for now, at least), you won’t find international hotel chains outside the eponymous colonial capital. Tourists are still something of a rarity and it is not uncommon to be invited into a family’s home to share a pot of tea.      Contrasting strongly with the bright blue skies and the colourful macawis worn by locals, the flat plains outside Djibouti City have a harsh and otherworldly aesthetic, which are celebrated by the local tribespeople in poetry and song. The loose rocks that litter the khaki-coloured ground amid semi-wild herds of camel speak of the country’s volcanic past.      Away from the capital, which is wafted by a cool Red Sea breeze, Djibouti becomes oppressively hot in the summer months. Locals move slowly and purposefully; at least until the daily delivery of khat, a semi-narcotic plant chewed like gum, which seems to stop daily life in its tracks.      If you do manage to defy the heat, there are ample opportunities to connect with the natural world. Visitors can scale the dormant Ardoukoba volcano, explore Lake Assal, the lowest point in Africa, or go snorkelling with whale sharks in the Red Sea. Found in the Bay of Ghoubbet, these slow-moving giants trawl the Djiboutian coast, gorging on plankton.      Exhibiting a blend of African and Arabian culture, the people of Djibouti are equally fascinating. Gracious and welcoming to foreigners, their country still largely works along tribal lines, but it is quiet, unthreatening and small enough to get to grips with. Above all else, though, it’s absolutely stunning.","Djibouti  Attractions in Djibouti  Afar Triangle  Djibouti lies within a geological feature known as the Afar Triangle, one of the hottest and most desolate places on Earth. Part of the Great Rift Valley system, it is a wedge of flat desert pushing into the Ethiopian Massif. Much of it is below sea level.  Ambouli  Just outside Djibouti, stroll in the Ambouli palm grove during the cooler parts of the day.  Djibouti  In Djibouti, a late 19th-century city with a distinctly Arabic feel, visit the lively Central Market (Le Marché Central) near the Mosque.  Doralé  The beaches at Doralé and Khor-Ambado, which are both about 15km (10 miles) from Djibouti, offer safe swimming. Another good beach can be found at Ghoubet al Kharab, which is about an hour's drive from Lake Assal, and where black-lava cliffs border the beach.  Geology  Geology and wildlife enthusiasts may head to the wilderness around Lake Abbé (accessible by 4-wheel drive vehicles only), a gathering place for flamingos and pelicans and the location of strange natural steaming chimneys.  Gulf of Tadjoura  The Gulf of Tadjoura (especially Obock) contains many species of fish and coral and is ideal for diving, snorkelling and underwater photography; in many places, the coral reefs in the Red Sea are easily accessible from the beaches. The best time for these activities is from September to May when the waters of the Red Sea are clear. Waterskiing and windsurfing can also be arranged.  Lake Assal  Surrounded by dormant volcanoes and lava fields, Lake Assal, 100km (60 miles) to the southwest of Djibouti city, is one of the lowest surface areas anywhere on the planet (150m/570 ft below sea level); and is reachable only by 4-wheel drive vehicle. It is possible to windsurf on wheels in the desert areas.  Tropical Aquarium  Also worth seeing in Djibouti is the Tropical Aquarium with underwater exhibits from the Red Sea (open daily 1600-1830), and the Presidential Palace.",africa,,
jordan,"It’s easy to see why Lawrence of Arabia was so taken with Jordan. Probably the most appealing destination in the Middle East, this ancient Arab kingdom is a hospitable land packed with epic scenery and momentous relics.      Many travellers visit Jordan with its history in mind, and understandably so. The country is steeped in stories from the distant past, with the ruins to prove it. There’s the 2,000-year-old “lost city” of Petra, carved from rose-red sandstone cliffs by the Nabateans, and the legendary Lawrence of Arabia trail, which takes visitors from his crumbling fort at Azraq to the magnificent deserts of Wadi Rum.      Important biblical sites abound; visitors can trek along pilgrimage routes mentioned in the Old Testament, take in views of the Promised Land revealed to Moses and visit Bethany-by-the-Jordan where John baptised Jesus.      If Jordan’s overwhelming historical sites begin to wear you out, take a restorative dip in the therapeutic waters of the Dead Sea, go scuba diving over coral reefs in the Red Sea or stay in the desert with Bedouins, who offer travellers a glimpse into their traditional way of life.      For all its history and natural beauty, though, Jordan looks forward. Its relatively stable economic and political position in the Middle East has fuelled modernisation, particularly in the capital Amman. With new upmarket hotels, restaurants and bars, the city is no longer just a base from which to explore the ancient sites, but a destination in its own right.      In Jordan, hospitality is king. Everywhere you visit you will hear heartfelt words of welcome, and will often be invited into shops or peoples’ homes for a glass of sweet tea and a conversation. In other places this might prelude a hard-sell campaign of carpet-flogging, but in Jordan, it’s almost always borne simply of an interest to engage with a visitor. As the Jordanians say; “Ahlan wa sahlan” – come in and make yourself at home.","Jordan  Attractions in Jordan  Admire the amazing remains at the Amman Citadel  Towering over the bustle of downtown Amman, the capital’s Citadel Hill boasts extensive archaeological remains, including an early-Islamic ruler’s palace, Byzantine churches, the Hand of Hercules and the Roman Temple of Hercules. Come here for the history and the amazing views right across the city.  Be mesmerised by multicoloured marine life at Aqaba  Go diving at Aqaba and be wowed by the psychedelic underworld of the Red Sea. After admiring the beauty of the fish in their coral palaces, head back to shore to sample a few marine delicacies in one of the town's many fish restaurants.  Carve out some time for Petra  Petra is one of the great wonders of the Middle Eastern world – a city hewn from solid rock. Built during the 5th and 6th centuries BCE, Petra is the ruined capital of the Nabatean Arabs. There are many sites to see, including the el Khazneh (The Treasury) monument, the Temple of the Winged Lions and the al-Deir (Monastery).  Discover Jerash's illustrious past  Catch the spirit of ancient Rome in a trip to Jerash, a magnificently preserved Roman city north of Amman. With columns, temples, colonnaded streets, grand theatres and silent churches, the city's grand past is architecturally apparent and even today the remains endure as a feast for the eyes.   Drive into the desert to visit Qasr Tuba  Hire a guide with a 4-wheel drive vehicle and disappear into the eastern desert. Just when you think you're on the road to nowhere, you'll stumble across Qasr al Tuba, the most remote of the Umayyad desert castles, built in CE 743 for Caliph Walid II.  Explore the waters at the Baptism Site  In an isolated location beside the River Jordan, take time to explore the Baptism Site, a network of channels and pools where it is said John the Baptist baptised Jesus Christ. Ancient churches and hermits' caves attest to the biblical past of this astonishing place.  Find Bedouin culture in Feynan  Far from any roads, hidden away in the harsh Wadi Araba desert, Feynan offers a living link to Jordan’s Bedouin culture. Stay at the award-winning eco lodge here – lit only by candles – for epic stargazing, superb wilderness walks and fascinating encounters with local Bedouin families for coffee and campfire stories.  Float in the Dead Sea  Bob like a cork in the dense salt water of the Dead Sea. Lying 400m (1320ft) below sea level, and spanning the border between Israel and Jordan, the Dead Sea is a natural wonder. After, drop in at the Dead Sea Panorama museum to learn the sea is living up to its name and shrinking at an alarming rate.  Hark back millions of years at Jordan Museum, Amman  Occupying a pristine new building in downtown Amman, the Jordan Museum showcases the very best of Jordan’s archaeological finds, spanning nearly 1.5 million years of human history. Exhibitions are split between three engaging and interactive galleries: Modern Jordan, Living History and the Archaeological and Historical Gallery.  Hike the Dana Nature Reserve  Keep an eye open for ibex (wild mountain goats) on a hike in the Dana Nature Reserve. What you miss upon the rocky outcrops the enthusiastic park rangers will make up for with their lively evening chats before bedding down in the tranquil setting of an eco-lodge.  Make time for the mosaics at Umm Ar Rasas  Even if you've seen enough mosaics to last a lifetime, spare time for one more; the magnificent mosaic floors of the excavated church of St Stephen in Um er Rasas are the largest in Jordan, and deserving of their UNESCO World Heritage Site status for their fine detailing and perfect preservation.  Navigate the King's Highway  Drive along the historic King's Highway mentioned in the Old Testament.  The route follows a line of hilltops the length of Jordan. Call in at Madaba, famed for its superb Byzantine mosaic art, including a stunning mosaic map of the Holy Land, and make the detour to Mount Nebo, from where Moses looked over the Promised Land before he died.  Spot springtime blooms in Um Qais  Plan a visit to Jordan in April or May when garlands of springtime flowers lace the Roman monuments at Um Qais (Biblical Gadara), perched high above the Sea of Galilee. If you're lucky, you may happen on a black iris, the national flower of Jordan.  Spot the wildlife at the Azraq Wetlands  Visit one of Jordan's wildlife reserves, such as the Azraq Wetlands, or meander around the lowest nature reserve in the world at Wadi Mujib. Some residents (including hyena, wolf, gazelle, ostrich and oryx) are notoriously elusive but the infectious beauty of each location is easily caught.  Take a tour of the Desert Castles  East of Amman, tour a group of early-Islamic hunting lodges and trading posts known as the Desert Castles, built by the Umayyad dynasty based in Damascus. The best known include Kharanah and the frescoed Amra, but visitors shouldn’t miss the expertly restored grandeur of Qasr Hallabat.  Uncover the Crusader castle at Karak  Imagine the striking of ancient hooves on cobbles at Karak Castle, a mighty Crusader fortress amid the southern hills. Aim, too, for nearby Shobak Castle, once the Crusaders' headquarters in Jordan. If you listen extra hard, you may catch the whisper of the wind penetrating the underground passageways.  Unearth the black gem of the desert  Catch up with more recent history at Qasr al-Azraq castle, Lawrence of Arabia's headquarters during the Great Arab Revolt of 1917. Then head north towards Mafraq and explore the deserted black basalt city of Um al Jimal, affectionately known as the ""black gem of the desert"".  Wander Wadi Rum on camelback  Step into the magnificent wind-blown desert of Wadi Rum. The wind has shaped the sandstone cliffs into a cyclorama of pillars and rock arches, explorable by jeep, on foot or astride a camel. Alternatively, soar noiselessly above in a hot-air balloon. By night, enjoy a traditional feast in a Bedouin tent then fall asleep under the stars.  Weave your way to Mukawir  Visit the village of Mukawir and watch the women of the Bani Hamida workshop weave wool into colourful traditional designs. Nearby is Machaerus, the hilltop fortress of Herod Antipas, where it is said Salome danced for the head of John the Baptist.",middle east,,
kosovo,"Depending on your global perspective, Kosovo is either Europe’s youngest nation or not a nation at all. Since declaring independence from Serbia in 2008 it has received only partial recognition as a sovereign state by members of the United Nations. Its fragile footing and wretched modern history might make Kosovo an unlikely travel destination, but the country can be extremely rewarding for those keen to find out what lies beyond the headlines.      Cultures and religions have been clashing in modern day Kosovo for centuries, but between the periods of unrest, this small, landlocked country has pioneered peaceful coexistence and mutual enrichment of cultures. While Muslim Albanians dominate the population today, followed by Orthodox Christian Serbs, there are many other groups with their own unique cultures and ways of life.      Granted, roadside memorials and the occasional khaki-clad NATO soldier can make its cruel past somewhat hard to forget, but historic spots such as Janjevo and the UNESCO-listed Dečani Monastery showcase a distinguished Kosovan history that has been overshadowed by the recent catalogue of horrors.      Europe’s youngest capital, Pristina, is an increasingly eclectic city with a vibrant café culture, but pretty Prizren is the city that has most visitors smitten. Cobbled streets, ancient walls, Ottoman mosques and Orthodox churches lend a romantic air to this riverside town, while the popular Dokufest Film Festival and Hasi Jehon folklore festival give credence to its status as a cultural capital.      Much of the Kosovan countryside is uncharted territory for tourists, but dramatic mountain peaks, cascading waterfalls and limpid lakes are tailor made for adventure travellers. Combine all this with decidedly un-European prices and it’s not hard to see why visitor numbers are rising.      Whether you’re sipping coffee in cosmopolitan cafés, hiking through the hinterland or visiting crumbling historic sites, in Kosovo, when you look beyond yesterday’s headlines, you’ll find an affable land of surprising beauty.","Kosovo  Attractions in Kosovo  Discover Peja’s (Peć) historic charm  This historical town is nestled close to imposing mountains, a picturesque gorge and straddling the Bistrica River. Ancestral home of the Mediaeval Serbian Orthodox Church, it was heavily damaged by recent conflicts. A bustling central bazaar and lively market still beat resolutely and retain their Old World charms.  Eat meat on a (very) empty stomach  Kosovo, especially Serbian enclaves, is a paradise for carnivores. There is a cult of grilled meat, which is always fresh, competently cooked and served in huge portions. Ottoman heritage is evident with the likes of Tavë prizreni, a bake of lamb and aubergine, and the local markets should not be missed for those wishing to try Kosovo's traditional cheeses.  Feel cultured in cosmopolitan Pristina  Kosovo's capital holds the usual delights: the national museum, theatre and art gallery. There are also several historical mosques, such as Mbretit and Pirinaz, and the Serbian Church of St Nicholas with its rich iconostasis. The boldest statement though, is the modern architecture of Kosovo National Library; discuss its merits in one of the centre's many stylish cafes.  Find a cafe near the frontline crossing  The bridge across the Vardar River in the ethnically divided town of Mitrovica is possibly the most well known symbol of the conflict. Drop in the Dolce Vita café on the Serbian side, where peacekeepers and journalists mingle with local politicians and ex-paramilitaries, but avoid the area during periods of unrest.  Find the frescoes of Gračanica  The Serbian enclave close to Pristina is famous for its Orthodox monastery, founded in 1321. Visit the UNESCO-listed building and be sure to see its finest features – the vibrant coloured frescoes. Nearby are the ruins of the ancient Illyrian city of Ulpiana, one of the country's most fascinating archaeological sites.  Hike to the heart of the mountains  At 2,656m (8,714ft), Kosovo's highest mountain Gjeravica (Äeravica) is a fairly easy climb. It is located in southwest Kosovo, alongside Montenegro and Albania, and offers jaw-dropping panoramas over the Albanian Alps. As you're near the Albanian border, look for the heart-shaped Zemra Lake.  Make for the pink marbled monastery of Dečani  Another Medieval monument that has helped Kosovo on to the UNESCO World Heritage Site list is the perfectly preserved Orthodox monastery, Visoki Dečani. Built in 1335, the pink and white marble church is located in a small town in the west of the country and features a three-wall iconostasis.  Peer out of Prizren from the Kalaja Fortress  This Ottoman city, at the foot of the Sharr Mountains, sports several beautiful mosques and 16th-century Turkish baths. The Kalaja Fortress, whose cannons face out over Prizren, sits above the city and offers superb morning views. Nearby, the Church of Our Lady of Ljeviš is on UNESCO's list of World Heritage Sites.  Seek out the statue on Mother Teresa Boulevard  The main pedestrian drag in Pristina is lined with cafés and restaurants, frequented by Kosovar politicians, foreign officials and peacekeepers. Walk along the tree-lined street to find the statue erected to celebrate the famous missionary, who despite being born in Macedonia, was of Kosovar Albanian ancestry.  Strap on the skis for Brezovica  The Serb-run resort of Brezovica in Sharr (Šar) Mountains, on the border with Macedonia, attracts mostly Albanian clientele, serving as a rare example of peaceful co-existence between two communities. History aside, the resort offers exceptional skiing and is the training base for a number of the national winter sports teams.",europe,,
somalia,"Think Somalia and what springs to mind? Pirates, Civil War, Islamic militants? Suffice to say it’s not your average holiday destination. Until 2012 the country had been without a government for two lawless decades and, although the fractured nation has witnessed a period of relative stability recently, it remains highly dangerous.      Travel is possible in the northern districts of the self-proclaimed Republic of Somaliland, a quasi-independent state that has broken away from the rest of Somalia. Travellers, however, should avoid visiting other areas.      And that's a shame, because behind the turmoil lies a destination of considerable beauty. Somalia has a varied landscape of mountains, deserts, tropical rainforests, undiscovered beaches and coral reefs. Sadly, much of it is under threat from unregulated logging, drought and the ongoing civil war.      Modern day Somalia developed from a string of Arab sultanates, which were scattered along the northeast coast of Africa. As Arab influence waned during the late 19th century, the British, French and Italians designated these territories as protectorates. These were the subjects of various treaties, forged amid frequent clashes between the colonial powers and the neighbouring Ethiopians, and between the European powers themselves.      The problems Somalia experiences today were sown in 1960, when the British and Italian Somalilands were merged. Inherited tribal rivalries and territorial disputes have dominated the country's history since.      Years of fighting between rival warlords and an inability to deal with famine and disease have led to the deaths of up to one million people. The area is still extremely volatile, with attacks taking place, especially in the capital of Mogadishu.      Those keen on travelling to the region would be well advised to visit neighbouring Ethiopia or Djibouti instead. But if you are set on Somalia, there are a handful of attractions to see including the Laas Geel cave complex, which offers exquisite Neolithic art and stunning rock formations      Gorgeous beaches and beautiful coral reefs can also be found along the coast, but you’d have to be one dedicated beach bum to seek them out.","Somalia  Attractions in Somalia  Be captivated by beautiful beaches  Somalia's beaches line the Indian Ocean in the east and are protected by a coral reef running from Mogadishu to the Kenyan border in the south. White sands and shimmering cyan seas offer a picture of paradise; whilst ghostly stretches of abandoned war-torn buildings have their own unique atmosphere.  Explore the former grandeur of Mogadishu  Were it not for the warlords, parts of the capital would be highly attractive to tourists. Crumbling now, the stone city walls were once grand fortifications that defended the city, whilst lighthouses, mosques and tombs shine a light on a more illustrious past. The Shanghai Old City was once the playground of the wealthy and remains a scenic spot.  See the cave paintings of Las Geel  Hundreds of well-preserved Neolithic paintings decorate the walls of this inter-connected series of caves and shelters in Somaliland. Las Geel deserves to be a UNECSO World Heritage Site but sadly, due to the current political state of Somalia, and the unrecognised status of Somaliland, this is unlikely to happen anytime soon.  Spot rare species at Kismayo National Park  With orange sands and green shrubbery, Kismayo National Park contains many common East African species such as elephants, zebras and giraffes, and the rare Hunter's hartebeest. Somalia other great savannah, Hargeisa National Park, situated outside the city of Mogadishu in the north, is a protected slice of oft unseen Africa.  Wonder at Hargeisa's unique War Memorial  In the heart of Hargeisa, the capital of the self-declared state of Somaliland, a war memorial stands to commemorate state's breakaway attempt in the 1980s. Shunning the grandiose or classical styles of traditional war memorials, the monument at Freedom Square consists of crashed MiG-17 fighter plane and a fresco of a citizen with bleeding limbs.",africa,,
palau,"An untamed paradise for divers and snorkellers, Paula is an archipelago of more than 500 islands, which sprout like giant mushrooms from the crystalline waters of the Pacific Ocean.      The island of Koror is the beating heart of the country and the entry point for most visitors. Home to most of Palau’s inhabitants, it is far from the prettiest island in the archipelago and few choose to linger here. Those who do, however, can grab a slice of Micronesian life in the local bars and restaurants, where charismatic natives take pleasure convincing foreigners to try the local delicacy: fruit bat soup.      Palau is also home to some of the world’s healthiest and most impressive UNESCO-listed reefs. Iridescent corals swirl around the islands, their marine populations teeming with a bounty few other places can match. Indeed, not a list exists that doesn’t rank Palau’s Blue Corner amongst the planet’s top dive sites.      It isn’t just in the tropical seas where strange creatures thrive, for Palau is also home to one of the most ecologically sensitive and unique evolutionary phenomena: Jellyfish Lake. Cut off from the sea millions of years ago, the lake’s predator-free inhabitants have evolved to lose their poisonous sting. To snorkel slowly amongst these gentle creatures is to float through an alien world.      While it’s easy to see Palau's beauty, a closer look will reveal scars from ferocious battles that took place on these shores during WWII. Ship and plane wrecks remain buried in dark lagoons, while long-forgotten bunkers and rusted machine guns are peppered across the islands. This is testament to Palau’s tumultuous modern history, which saw it swap hands from Germany to Japan and, finally, the Untied States, before achieving independence in 1994.      While Palau may be remote and untamed, it is precisely these attributes that make it one of the world’s last unspoiled natural beauties. The archipelago endures as a marvel of Mother Nature, stands proud as a centre for Micronesian culture and offers a haunting memorial to battles once fought in its turquoise waters.","Palau  Attractions in Palau  Chart a sailing boat  Get out into the heart of the Rock Islands aboard a sailing yacht or dive liveaboard. Spending a few days aboard a gently rocking ship, moving from one remote, idyllic island to another is a truly memorable way to experience Palau's natural beauty and its most memorable dive sites.  Don your wetsuit  Get active with one of the many watersports on offer. Choose from snorkelling trips, sea kayaking, sailing, sportfishing, surfing and of course diving and get out into the heart of the Rock Islands. There are several high quality outfits that offer a variety of trips and tours.  Explore Koror  Most people use Koror as a stepping-stone to explore the rest of Palau. But hang around in the capital, the busiest centre in the islands, and you will find many craft shops, a handful of local restaurants and some lively bars, which serve up an authentic slice of Palauan culture.  Feed your head at Ngarachamayong Cultural Centre  Discover more about Palau's rich cultural heritage by paying a visit to the cultural centre, funded by a $2.5million grant from China. Palauan culture is matrilineal and the centre was founded by a group of visionary women who aim to preserve local traditions and educate locals and visitors alike.  Go scuba diving  Enjoy Palau's many and varied dive sites – considered some of the best in the world – including the famous Blue Corner. Other top sites are Ngemelis Wall, aka the Big Drop-off; the German Channel, known for its manta rays; Siaes Tunnel, an underwater cavern where white-tip reef sharks are common; and Chandelier Cave, where underwater chambers filled with stalactites.  Kayak around Rock Islands  Explore the stunning natural beauty of the Rock Islands by kayak or canoe. Jutting out from the water, the Rock Islands are Palau's crowning glory and there are countless dive and aqua sports centres offering guided or self-guided kayak tours.  Pay a visit to Palau Aquarium  Understand Palau's diverse marine ecosystem better with a visit to the aquarium. Themed exhibits feature varieties of hard and soft corals, some of the region's numerous fish species as well as invertebrates such as the famous stingless jellyfish, giant clams and even crocodiles. The aquarium is part of the Palau International Coral Reef Centre.  Seek out WWII relics  Step back in time with Palau's abundance of WWII relics. Some of the most ferocious battles of the Pacific took place in these waters and submerged war wrecks, fighter planes, rusted machine guns and hidden bunkers rest as testament to the thousands of men who lost their lives here.  Set sail for Peleliu Island  Visit the island of Peleliu, which forms the southern boundary of the Rock Islands. In 1985 it was designated a US National Historic Landmark, owing to the part it played in WWII. Abandoned tanks, helmets and bomb casings are still dotted throughout the island and some of Palau's best dive sites are located here.  Swim in Jellyfish Lake  Don't worry: it won't hurt. Located in one of the Rock Islands, it was cut off from the sea millions of years ago and the jellyfish have evolved to be completely stingless. Snorkelling through the dark lake amidst hundreds of thousands of jellyfish is a unique experience.  Swim with dolphins  Look into the eyes of a dolphin as you swim alongside it in the clear, fish-laden waters of Palau. Located just off Koror, the Dolphins Pacific is one of the world's largest marine mammal interaction, educational and research facilities and offers wonderful opportunities to swim with these magnificent creatures.  Take a hike on Babeldaob  Roam around Babeldaob, Palau's biggest island at about 43km (27 miles) long and 24km (15 miles) across at its widest. It is a tropical gem comprising lush, green vegetation, steep mountains, freshwater lakes and sand dunes. It offers great opportunities for hiking, driving (4x4s are recommended) or mountain biking.  Visit the Badrulchau Monoliths  See the 37 stone monoliths known as Badrulchau, concrete examples of Babeldaob's early civilisation. The basalt stone pillars, weighing up to 4,500kg each, are believed to date to around AD100 and archaeologists think they may have been the support for a building. They are found located in a field in the far north of Babeldaob Island.  Wander around the Belau National Museum  Learn about the ancestry and rich cultural heritage of Palau with a visit to the Belau National Museum where more than 1,000 relics of the past are housed, including shell money and traditional weapons. Exhibits include photographs, art, sculptures and the traditional carved storyboards.",oceania,pacific islands of micronesia,
republic of congo,"Bordered to the East by the vast Congo River, the Republic of Congo is often confused with its bigger and more notorious sibling, the DRC, on the other side of the river, and this certainly hasn’t done its tourist reputation any favours in recent years.      But for those intrepid enough to give the smaller, quieter and lesser-known Congo a try, they’ll find that it boasts beautiful landscapes characterised by undulating virgin rainforest, waterfalls, lagoons, river rapids and swamps. These wild places are home to an abundance of interesting flora and fauna, most notably rare primate species such as mountain gorillas and chimpanzees.      While these iconic primates are the main attraction for the handful of tourists now trickling into the country, the forest is also home to several indigenous tribes, which have maintained their traditional way of life, almost entirely removed from Western civilization.      Standing in stark contrast to most of the rest of the country, Congo’s fast-growing capital, Brazzaville, is a fascinating metropolis. Looking across the Congo River to the dilapidated sprawl of Kinshasa, the DRC capital, Brazzaville is by far the prettier and more appealing of the two cities, with a burgeoning arts scene, good food, vibrant nightlife, an interesting colonial heritage and welcoming locals.      Since it gained its independence from the French in 1960, the Republic of Congo has been plagued by sporadic but severe bouts of civil war and ethnic conflict, the most bloody of which followed disputed parliamentary elections in 1993 and reached its pinnacle in 1997, fuelled in part by the prize of the country's substantial offshore oil wealth, which motivated many of the warlords.      A peace accord was finally signed in 2003 and since then the country has slowly but surely been reimagining itself as a peaceful destination that is no longer defined by its torrid history, and one that deserves to be noticed and appreciated.","Republic of Congo  Attractions in Republic of Congo  Delve into Congo’s history at Diosso  Around 20km (12 miles) from Pointe Noire are the villages of Loango and Diosso. Loango was a major embarkation port for slaves during the era of the transatlantic slave trade. The Gorges of Diosso, spectacular cliffs formed by the erosion of the sea and the wind, are well worth visiting, as are some of the remote and idyllic palm-fringed beaches nearby.  Experience Congo’s biodiversity at Conkouati-Douli National Park  Not far from Pointe Noire, stretching from the Atlantic coastline into densely-forested mountains, Conkouati-Douli is Congo's most diverse park and recent investment in conservation has seen a rejuvenation of wildlife stocks previously decimated by poaching. Gorillas, elephants, buffalo and chimpanzee can be seen here, as can sea turtles laying eggs on the beach.  Explore bustling Brazzaville  The small, crumbling Congolese capital is situated on the banks of the mighty Congo River, with clear views across the water to DRC's capital Kinshasa on the opposite bank. Brazzaville has a number of pulsing markets and a surprisingly vibrant arts and culture scene, as well as some fascinating colonial relics and memorials.  Get lost in D’Odzala National Park  One of the oldest parks in Africa, the arrival of African Parks and Wilderness Safaris has breathed new life into D'Odzala after decades of turmoil. Remote even by Congo's standards, the only way to access the park is on an exclusive fly-in safari. Activities include face-to-face encounters with habituated lowland gorilla families, accompanied by local BaAka (pygmy) guides.  Kick back in Pointe Noire  Pointe Noire is Congo's economic capital, but it often feels more like a small seaside town. The beachfront itself is rundown and relatively underdeveloped, but therein lies much of its charm. And there are still a number of good spots for a seaside sundowner. Away from the beach, the city has a bustling market and a few good restaurants.  Marvel at the Loufoulakari Falls  Find beautiful panoramic views of the verdant surrounding countryside at the Loufoulakari Falls, the confluence of the Congo and Loufoulakari rivers. A bumpy 80km (50-mile) drive from the capital Brazzaville, Loufoulakari is held to be the most impressive falls in the region and well worth a day trip.  Ride ‘La Gazelle’  This air-conditioned train runs between Brazzaville and Pointe Noire a few times a week and is a much more immersive experience than taking the short flight. Though it's a slow and arduous journey, there is some striking scenery along the way. Do spend time some considering the human cost of this journey: the construction of this historic train line claimed the lives of more than 17,000 Congolese.  Stroll around Linzolo  The first Catholic church in Congo was built in 1882 by a French priest and is located in Linzolo, 30km (19 miles) from the capital. The small city is also home to the regional seat of the World Health Organization and a very good market.  Track gorillas in Nouabalé-Ndoki National Park  Once referred to by National Geographic as the world's 'Last Eden', this vast and remote park in the northern corner of Congo is home to lowland gorillas, forest elephants and chimpanzees among other interesting fauna found in the swampy rainforest. The park is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  Unwind at Les Rapides  Just west of Brazzaville, at Les Rapides, the Congo River can be observed in all its power and glory. These wide and untamed falls are best observed with a frosty beer in hand in the leafy garden of the bar at the river's edge, which is a popular weekend hang out with locals and tourists alike.",africa,,
kuwait,"In Kuwait you'll find an intriguing mix of Western liberalism and traditional Islamic culture. The capital, Kuwait City, is a bustling metropolis of high-rise buildings and luxury hotels, while the Gulf country is also home to spectacular mosques and palaces. Religion is an integral part of daily life here.  This juxtaposition perhaps stems from Kuwait's marrying of Islamism with oil wealth, which for decades has earned it the attention of Western powers. Upon independence from Britain in 1961, Sheikh Abdullah assumed head of state, adopting the title of emir. The large revenues from oil production allowed independent Kuwait to build up its economic infrastructure and institute educational and social welfare programmes.  In the early 1990s, the emir established a National Assembly (Majlis), which placed limits on the power of the ruling family. Since then, the national assembly has clashed several times with the emir and the cabinet (which is still dominated by the al-Sabah family) over misuse of state funds and poor management of the all-important oil industry. Underlying these disputes is the growing impression that the ageing al-Sabah clan is no longer capable of running the country. However, they continue to dominate Kuwaiti policies.  Surrounded by three major Middle Eastern powers, Kuwait became the target of Iraqi territorial claims, leading to Saddam Hussein's invasion of the country in 1990. The Kuwaitis later recovered their country by virtue of a US-led, UN-backed multinational military force.  After a period of euphoria, the Kuwaitis had to address a number of difficult questions; the future security of the country was dealt with by the signing of defence and security pacts with the USA, the UK and Kuwait's Gulf allies. More recently, Kuwait was one of the first countries to join Operation Iraqi Freedom following the US-led war against Iraq, and provided aid and support during Iraq's (ongoing) process of reconstruction.  Beyond the geopolitical dimension, Kuwait is a fascinating country with much elaborate architecture and a superb culinary tradition. Its inhabitants are a warm, welcoming bunch, while the fact that Kuwait is a bit less glitzy than other oil-rich Gulf countries means that it can feel like a haven of tradition Arab culture.","Kuwait  Attractions in Kuwait  Failakai Island  A port with many old dhows, Failakai Island can be reached by regular ferry services. There are also some Bronze Age and Greek archaeological sites well worth viewing, including the island's Greek temple. Traditional-style boums and sambuks (boats) are still built in Al Jahrah, although, nowadays, vessels are destined to work as pleasure boats rather than pearl fishing or trading vessels. Mina Al Ahmadi, lying 19km (12 miles) south of Kuwait City, is an oil port with immense jetties for supertanker traffic. The Oil Display Centre pays homage to the work of the Kuwait Oil Company.  Kuwait City  Kuwait City is a bustling metropolis of high-rise office buildings, luxury hotels, wide boulevards and well-tended parks and gardens. Its most dominant landmark is Kuwait Towers, and its oldest is Seif Palace, built in 1896, the interior of which features original Islamic mosaic tilework, though these suffered badly during the Iraqi occupation. The Kuwait National Museum was also stripped of many artefacts - part of it has been renovated and is now open to the public. The Sadu House, near the museum, is made of coral and gypsum and is used as a cultural museum to protect the arts and crafts of Bedouin society. The huge Grand Mosque in the centre is also worth visiting. Liberation Tower, the symbol of Kuwaiti liberation, is one of the tallest telecommunications towers in the world. Visitors can travel 150m (492ft) up to the revolving obervation tower and restaurant.  Sailing  Sailing and scuba-diving are available. Powerboating is a Kuwaiti passion. Horse riding clubs flourish in the winter.  Sea clubs  Many of Kuwait's sea clubs ofer a wide variety of facilities and activities such as indoor and outdoor swimming pools, beaches, tennis courts, gyms, bowling and even karate.",middle east,,
new zealand,"Widely held to be one of the most breathtaking countries on the planet, New Zealand is a phenomenal travel destination. The rugged mountains and remote valleys that thrust the destination into the world’s spotlight through The Lord of the Rings trilogy tell only part of the story – you’ll also find beaches, fjords, lakes and gorgeous swathes of forest, not to mention age-old Maori culture, forward-looking cities and, famously, a world-class array of outdoor activities. Not only does it pack a punch as hard as an All Black tackle, but it's also incredibly easy to travel around. What’s not to love?      Split into two main landmasses – the North and South Islands –New Zealand is a deceptively diverse and complicated destination that rewards both first-time and repeat visitors. The North Island is less visually dramatic than its southern counterpart, but it is home to around two thirds of the country’s inhabitants. The majority of the major urban centres are here, including the capital, Wellington, and the increasingly dynamic city of Auckland. But nature is still a major player, thanks to volcanoes, thermal regions and the magnificent Bay of Islands.      The South Island is home to far fewer people, but boasts the country’s most spectacular scenery. Empty beaches, soaring mountain ranges, glaciers, fjords, wide-open expanses – they’re all here. Outdoor enthusiasts can take their pick from tramping (hiking), cycling, climbing, white-water rafting, caving, zorbing, sky-diving, bungee jumping and more. Christchurch, a city bouncing back with extraordinary creativity from earthquake damage, is also here.      New Zealand has also developed into one of the cleanest and greenest countries in the world. There are 14 national parks throughout the country and almost a quarter of New Zealand is protected land. What else? There’s wildlife, wine and a cultural resurgence that’s seeing local films, literature and art gaining more and more attention.      A blend of Maori and European culture, coupled with breathtaking landscapes, provides New Zealand with a truly unique character.","New Zealand  Attractions in New Zealand  Admire the beauty of Coromandel Peninsula  Easily accessible from Auckland, the Coromandel Peninsula is an attractive holiday destination. Covered in native rainforest, it has superb white-sand beaches. Explore the beautiful west coast, walk through the scenic reserves, skydive in Whitianga or kayak off-shore before retreating to the warm pools at Hot Water Beach.  Check out Christchurch  The 'Garden City' of Christchurch was rocked by a devastating earthquake in February 2011, which killed 181 people and badly damaged the centre of town. However, the resilient city has largely returned to normal. The centre is filled with neo-gothic architecture reminiscent of an old English university town. Visit the Christchurch Art Gallery (www.christchurchartgallery.org.nz), which is home to an impressive collection of local, home-grown art, punt along the River Avon, visit the earthquake-damaged Anglican cathedral, or soak up the atmosphere from one of the city’s bustling cafés.  Climb Aoraki/Mt Cook  The effort in making the steep climb up Aoraki/Mt Cook is repaid with outstanding views over alpine glaciers, snow-capped peaks and crystal-clear lakes. Standing 3,754m (12,316ft) tall, Aoraki/Mt Cook is the highest mountain in New Zealand. The mountain, which attracts climbers from all over the world, stands in Aoraki/Mt Cook National Park (www.doc.govt.nz), on New Zealand's South Island. If using your feet seems like too much effort, take the TranzAlpine (www.tranzscenic.co.nz) train and enjoy one of the world's finest rail trips, journeying coast to coast through the Southern Alps.  Discover Maori culture  Auckland Museum (www.aucklandmuseum.com) is filled with Maori and Pacific Island collections and the Te Papa Tongarewa Museum of New Zealand (www.tepapa.govt.nz) in Wellington has a heavy emphasis on Maori heritage, treasures and biculturalism. In Rotorua's cultural centres, see how young Maori learn the skills of traditional bone, wood and greenstone carving. Visit a marae (a Maori meeting house) and enjoy a concert of traditional songs and the haka (a Maori challenge usually witnessed before All Blacks rugby matches) and sit down to a hangi (a delicious feast cooked in an earth oven).  Engage with the marine life  The Poor Knights Islands (near Whangarei) are particularly renowned among divers for their marine life, geology and clear waters; there are also a number of wrecks deliberately sunk here for divers to explore – for other dive sites, contact New Zealand Underwater (www.nzunderwater.org.nz). Swim with dolphins in the Bay of Islands (north of Auckland), the Coromandel Peninsula, Kaikoura (South Island), Curio Bay in the Catlins and Whakatane. Stay dry but witness giants of the deep when whale watching on the eastern coast of South Island – whales are attracted to a deep ocean trench just off the coast of Kaikoura. Most sightings occur from April to August. For more information, contact Whale Watch (www.whalewatch.co.nz).  Enjoy the sun in Nelson  At the far northwest corner of the South Island stands Nelson, the sunniest region in New Zealand. The bright, bohemian city is the focal point of the region, which boasts everything from long golden beaches of the Abel Tasman National Park to tranquil twin pools in the Nelson Lakes National Park. The curving 30km-long (19-mile) sand bar, Farewell Spit, where thousands of wading and wetland birds nest in the summer, is also accessible by 4-wheel-drive.  Explore Rotorua  The bubbling mud pools, colourful thermal lakes and performing geyser at Wai-O-Tapu (www.waiotapu.co.nz), and the boiling whirlpools, steam jets and sulphur pools of Hell’s Gate are among the best of Rotorua's thermal attractions. Visitors can also check out the volcanoes at nearby Tongariro to see the explosive aftermath of previous eruptions.  Explore Waitomo Caves  Waitomo Caves are a set of more than 300 limestone caverns, where explorers can abseil into the 'lost world'; they are especially famous for their glow-worm grottos. You can also try black-water rafting or tubing, where participants float through the cave system on custom-made tyres. The more adventurous can also try canyoning and clambering up and down waterfalls whilst underground.  Fjords and Milford Sound  Breathtaking fjords indent the lower west coast of the South Island. Cruise around Milford Sound in the shadow of iconic Mitre Peak or dive into its icy-cold waters to see red and black corals. Kayak around Doubtful Sound to escape the crowds and discover cascading waterfalls.  Get active in Queenstown  New Zealand's main centre for outdoor sports lies on the shore of stunning Lake Wakatipu, beneath giant craggy mountains. Vibrant and bursting with energy, this is the perfect year-round base for testing your nerves on any of the many adrenaline-fuelled activities on offer. Try bungee jumping, caving, rafting, jetboating, skydiving, skiing and much more before returning to the atmospheric food and nightlife scene.  Go east to Napier  Razed by an earthquake in 1931 and subsequently rebuilt in the Art Deco style of the time, the laid-back coastal town of Napier now boasts one of the world's finest collections of lovingly preserved Art Deco buildings. Walk along the two central streets, Emerson and Tennyson, to see some of the finest examples, or head to the National Tobacco Company building to admire the intricately detailed interior; visit at night to see it imaginatively lit.  Go white-water rafting  Popular rivers for this thrilling sport include the Wairora (near Tauranga), the Mohaka (in Hawke's Bay) and the Kaituna (near Rotorua), which features the world's highest commercially rafted waterfall at 7m (23ft). Black-water rafting through underground caves is a rare opportunity to experience. Alternatively, tackle the three- to five-day canoe journey on the Whanganui River to see some of the North Island's finest scenery.  Head up to Auckland  A good starting point when exploring New Zealand’s largest, most multicultural city, is the distinctive Sky Tower (www.skycityauckland.co.nz) – a syringe-shaped tower that offers fantastic views of the city, its beaches and the coast. It’s also possible for the particularly brave tourist to abseil down the side of the building to the street (a drop of over 100m/328ft). Additionally, explore the waterfront and harbour area; visit the National Maritime Museum (www.nzmaritime.org) and Auckland Museum (www.aucklandmuseum.com); or walk through The Domain, an old volcanic cone, to find the Winter Garden. Alternatively, sail across to North Shore to visit the pretty bays and eastern suburbs, or explore the islands dotting the Hauraki Gulf.  Hike through the countryside  Known locally as ‘tramping’, this is one of the principal pastimes for New Zealanders. Do as they do and tramp though stunning national parks and protected forest areas. Popular walks include the government-designated Great Walks, including the Abel Tasman Coastal Track, the Lake Waikaremoana Track, the world-famous Milford Track, the Routeburn Track and the remote Rakiura Track; other routes such as the Hollyford, Greenstone and Dusky tracks are just as spectacular but less well-known and so less busy. Contact the Department of Conservation (DOC) (www.doc.govt.nz) for more information.  Hit the slopes  New Zealand is the leading ski and snowboard destination in the southern hemisphere. The best time to hit the slopes for skiing, snowboarding and winter mountaineering is from June to September. On the North Island, the biggest ski areas are on Mt Ruapehu. There are excellent ski slopes in the South Island in the Southern Lakes region and at Mt Hutt. A unique alternative is to glacier ski and glacier walk in the Southern Alps.  Hunt for fish  Fishing for brown and rainbow trout is particularly popular. Salmon fishing is best in the Rakaia, Rangitata, Waimakariri and Waitaki rivers. For further information on seasons and permits, contact the New Zealand Professional Fishing Guides Association (tel: (06) 868 4214; www.fishingguides.co.nz) or New Zealand Fish and Game (tel: (04) 499 4767; www.fishandgame.org.nz). There is also some superb sea and big-game fishing available off the coast of the North Island, where the warm Pacific waters are home to marlin and snapper. A number of charter organisations can arrange fishing trips.  Marvel at the Franz Josef and Fox Glaciers  These two breathtaking ice tongues are located at the heart of Westland National Park. They extend right down from the summits through the forest, and to the coastal zone, a unique phenomenon not found anywhere else in the world. The 12km-long (7.5-mile) Franz Josef and Fox Glaciers are the two largest glaciers of the 140 or so that lie within the park’s boundaries. Take to the air in a helicopter to see the scale of the glaciers or drive or walk out to the snout of each ice wall for a closer look.  Pump up the adrenaline   This is the world's prime destination for bungee jumping, where daredevil participants dive off a tall bridge or other structure with an elastic cord strapped to their ankles. Famous jump-off points include the Kawarau River Bridge, the Nevis, the Pipeline, and the Ledge (all near Queenstown), Taupo and Mangaweka (North Island) and Hanmer Springs (South Island). Alternatively, try bridge swinging: falling then swinging along a gorge whilst harnessed to a cable. New Zealand is also the birthplace of zorbing, which involves being strapped into or diving into a zorb (an inflatable transparent plastic ball) with a bucket of water, which is then rolled down a grassy hill or onto a river.  See stunning wildlife  Good bird-watching spots include Taiaroa Head (near Dunedin) – known for colonies of royal albatross – and Stewart Island, which represents your best chance to see an elusive kiwi in the wild. Cape Kidnappers in Hawkes Bay is home to the only gannet colony in the world. In Dunedin, in the Otago Peninsula, you may see rare yellow-eyed penguins and fur seals. Some of the world's oldest trees are in the forests of the Northland Forest Park, including the famous kauri, many of which date back centuries. Offshore island reserves, such as Tiritiri Matangi Island north of Auckland and Kapiti Island north of Wellington, protect a number of endangered species that no longer survive on the mainland.  Set sail in the harbour or jetboat down the river  Auckland, dubbed 'the city of sails', is a perfect spot for sailing and yachting. Cruise the harbour in tall ships or sailboats, visit vineyards on neighbouring islands, or go further afield on an excursion to the remote maritime reserves in the Bay of Islands, Hauraki Gulf and Marlborough Sounds. Or for a faster pace, take a high-speed jetboat trip, which is guaranteed to leave you breathless and soaked as these high-powered craft hurtle down rivers at dizzying speeds. Trips run on many of the country's best-known rivers, including Queenstown's Shotover River and on the Waikato River beneath the Huka Falls.  Surf along the coast  New Zealand surf is truly spectacular. Some of the best breaks are located at Mahia Peninsula (near Gisborne), Muriwai, Palliser Bay (near Wellington) and Piha. You can also ride one of the best left-hand breaks in the world at Raglan. Beginners should start by bodysurfing or by riding boogie boards. For more information visit Surf.co.nz (www.surf.co.nz).  Taste local wines   Wine is produced in areas the length and breadth of New Zealand. A great place to enjoy a tipple is the wine-growing region of Hawke's Bay. Around 70 wineries allow visitors in to sample the region's respected red wines, particularly Pinot Noir. The Marlborough province in the South Island also has world-class wineries producing white, sharp Chardonnay and crisp Sauvignon Blanc. For more information, contact New Zealand Winegrowers (www.nzwine.com). For a more potent tipple, visit the South Island's whisky distilleries, including Southern Distilleries Ltd. (tel: (03) 208 9907;www.hokonuiwhiskey.com), reputed to be the world's southernmost distillery, at Timaru.  Uncover Stewart Island/Rakiura  Remote and rugged, Stewart Island has a rich Maori heritage and a mass of wilderness to explore and enjoy. With just one town and barely any roads, it has hundreds of hidden beaches, bays and sandy coves. Fishing is the lifeblood of the islands and seafood here is exceptional. Hikers tackle the 10-day circuit of the top half of the island or sections of trail, whilst wildlife enthusiasts and birdwatchers come to see kiwi in their natural habitat.  Unearth the history of the Bay of Islands  One of New Zealand’s most historic regions, the Bay of Islands is also the setting for one of the North Island’s most popular resort areas. The main towns, Paihia, Waitangi and Russell are the hub for excursions to sail, dive, swim with dolphins and explore this picturesque part of the country. Waitangi is also home to the Waitangi Treaty Grounds, where the historic Treaty of Waitangi was signed in 1840 between Maoris and the British Monarchy.  Visit Wellington  Whilst not New Zealand’s largest city, the capital is its cultural centre. The spectacular Te Papa Tongarewa Museum of New Zealand (www.tepapa.govt.nz), on the city's pretty waterfront, is Wellington's star attraction. Window shop and people watch on 'alternative' Cuba Street or the more upmarket Courtenay Place; stroll through the Botanic Gardens (www.wellington.govt.nz); tramp up to the top of Mt Victoria for panoramic views; or cruise around the harbour or hire a kayak. There’s also an enormous number of good quality cafés and restaurants to sample.",oceania,,
nicaragua,"Fabled land of lakes and volcanoes, Nicaragua also lays claim to vibrant colonial cities, deserted beaches and wildlife-rich rainforests. Its vibrancy is all-encompassing, and the hospitality of its people is renowned throughout the Americas. The largest country in Central America, Nicaragua is also one of the safest and cheapest countries that constitute the ‘gringo trail'. That visitor numbers to this sun-drenched sanctuary are only increasing should come as no surprise.      What Nicaragua lacks in standout cultural attractions it compensates for with natural beauty. Its reefs and rainforests are hotbeds of biodiversity and teem with jaguars, monkeys and myriad bird species (though how this idyll will look after the Nicaragua Grand Canal has been built remains to be seen).      The country’s wild landscapes are fertile ground for thrill-seekers. Visitors can go hiking, biking, kayaking and swimming in the country’s iconic crater lakes. Whether you want to ride some of the world’s best waves, speed along zip-lines above the jungle or scuba dive along shelves of iridescent coral, Nicaragua has it all. Sound too much like hard work? Then kick back on the twin peaks of Ometepe Island, overlooking the shimmering Lake Nicaragua, or catch a boat into the Indío Maiz Biological Reserve, the largest area of virgin rainforest north of the Amazon.      Those hankering for the city life should head to León or Granada, two of Central America’s prettiest colonial cities. Both are hubs for travellers and represent gateways to nearby attractions. From León, you can climb the Maribios volcanic chain, go ‘volcano-boarding’ down the slopes of the still-rumbling Cerro Negro or pick coffee beans in the temperate northern highlands. Granada, meanwhile, is the ideal base to explore Masaya’s volcanic park, in particular, Volcano Acatenango, or zip-line over Mombacho’s cloud forest and take a cooling swim in Laguna de Apoyo.      For surfers, head to San Juan del Sur in search of the perfect wave, then spend your evenings dancing the night away in the city - made famous for its nightlife and the renowned ‘Sunday Funday’ festival. Others can abscond to the Corn Islands, an archipelago that offers everything you'd expect from the Caribbean, minus the sky-high prices. So grab a beer and join the party – it’s only just begun.","Nicaragua  Attractions in Nicaragua  Discover the beaches, turtles and party life of Rivas  The department of Rivas is home to surf and party capital, San Juan del Sur, as well as some of Nicaragua's most stunning – and often deserted – Pacific beaches, including El Coco, Marsella and Ocotal. The beach at La Flor Wildlife Reserve is where thousands of Olive Ridley turtles come to lay their eggs; you can watch them between July and January.  Don’t miss Managua  Most visitors bypass the capital Managua, a sprawling, busy city that’s somewhat less easy on the eye than its counterparts. But if you’re stopping over it’s worth visiting the National Museum, listening to a concert in the Rubén Darío National Theatre, or catching a baseball game, the country’s favourite sport, at the Dennis Martinez National Stadium.  Escape to the Corn Islands  Big Corn and Little Corn are two isolated Caribbean atolls that were once a haven for pirates. Just off the Nicaraguan east coast, Little Corn, in particular, is a pocket-sized paradise that ticks all the boxes – turquoise waters, palm-fringed white-sand beaches, stunning coral reefs and a relaxed vibe. Go snorkelling, diving, horseback riding, or just swinging in a hammock. Get there by plane or boat from Bluefields.  Go eco on Isla Ometepe  Rising out of Lake Nicaragua, this idyllic twin-coned volcanic island is home to friendly fishing and farming communities. Stay in one of the village’s small eco-lodges; climb steep Concepción or the easier but muddier Maderas; search for petroglyphs; cycle around the island or simply lounge on the lakeshore beaches.  Hop around the Solentiname Islands  Set in a remote corner of Lake Nicaragua, this archipelago is made up of 36 tropical islands and islets. A haven for hikers, birdwatchers and art lovers, San Fernando, Mancarrón, La Venada and Mancarroncita are the largest islands and play home to a community of primitivism artists and the Los Guatuzos Wildlife Refuge, a maze of forest and waterways that teems with wildlife.  Learn Spanish in Granada  This picture-perfect, colonial city on the shore of Lake Nicaragua makes an ideal base for exploring. Stroll around its cobbled streets and visit its ancient churches, kayak around its tiny islands, dine in its upmarket restaurants and, if you have time to fit it in around excursions, try some Spanish lessons at a non-profit school or look at volunteering opportunities.  Look out for jaguars in Indio Maíz  For the ultimate jungle adventure, explore the dense forest of the Indio Maíz Biological Reserve in the far southeast, home to more species of birds, trees and insects than the whole of Europe. Day hikes are run from nearby El Castillo or San Juan del Norte; go with an indigenous Rama Indian guide and, if you’re lucky, you might spot an elusive jaguar.  Make your weekend with Sunday Funday  One of the more debaucherous activities you’ll find when travelling Nicaragua, Sunday Funday is a hostel, pool and bar crawl through the sleepy beach town of San Juan del Sur that involves a lot of fun, a lot of sun, and plenty of drinking. Beginning at Pachamama hostel on the beach, the crawl finishes up in San Juan’s mountains at the Naked Tiger hostel, which is home to some of the most spectacular views in Nicaragua.  Meet Masaya’s artisans  There are two good reasons to visit the arty city of Masaya. Shop till you drop at the famous handicraft market where you can meet the skilled artisans and learn about the region’s fascinating folklore at the small museum. Or head to Masaya Volcano National Park, where you can hike around the ash-covered landscape and peer into a still-smoking crater.  Paddle down the Rio San Juan  Once an important transit route between the oceans, the river now forms the watery border with Costa Rica. Winding through remote towns and flanked by wildlife-filled forest, it still has an intrepid feel. Explore the fortress town of El Castillo, sail all the way to the Caribbean on a panga boat, or kayak along its banks to spot the diverse wildlife sitting beside the shores.  Penetrate the mists of Jinotega  Known as the ‘City of Mists’ for its wisps of high-altitude cloud, the birthplace of the Nicaraguan Revolution is now a peaceful city known for its cool climate, stunning valleys, pine forests and granite peaks. It makes a good base for exploring the surrounding coffee farms and nature reserves, lakes and rivers.  Rappel into Somoto Canyon  This geological wonder in northern Nicaragua is one of the oldest rock formations in Central America, dating back some 5 to 13 million years. Today, the whole canyon is protected as a National Monument; you can hike along its rocky trails to scenic viewpoints, take a boat tour, try rubber tubing along its crystal-clear water, or rappel down its vertical walls.  Ride down León’s Cerro Negro  Colonial León is the former capital with the lively, cultured feel of a university city. However, now, it’s made famous for its physical adventure attractions. For the thrill-seekers, climb to the top of Volcano Cerro Negro, and then shoot down its face on a purpose-built volcano board. For tours, Bigfoot Hostel run trips up and down the volcano, and if you have the fastest time, you’ll be treated to 3 celebratory shots of spicy chilli liquor.  Stay with a family in Estelí’s nature reserve  Estelí has a friendly, small-town feel with walls still covered in revolutionary murals from the 1980s. Nearby, Miraflor Natural Reserve offers hiking, riding and birdwatching through dry and cloud forest, famous for its hundreds of species of orchids. Accommodation is in basic cabins, or you can arrange a homestay with a local family to get a real taste of rural life.  Surf off San Juan del Sur  This one-time sleepy surfing hangout is now a bustling resort offering a plethora of attractions, from whale-watching cruises to horseback riding, with plenty of bars, restaurants and hotels to cater for all tastes and budgets. Maderas and Remanso surfing beaches are a short drive away, and you can take boats to other popular surf spots.  Wake up and smell the coffee in Matagalpa  If you want an authentic Nicaraguan caffeine hit or a bite of locally made chocolate, visit a coffee plantation in this temperate town in the northern highlands. Nearby, Finca Esperanza Verde is an eco-lodge, nature reserve and organic coffee farm set in tranquil cloud forest. It runs an award-winning reforestation programme and all tourism income is ploughed back into community projects.  Zipline over Mombacho Volcano  Mombacho's imposing cone can be seen from the historic city of Granada and the volcano's nature reserve is the perfect place to discover the flora and fauna of the cloud forest, including beautiful orchids in season. Local guides lead hikes from the peak to its craters, with spectacular panoramic views. Take the Miravalle Canopy Tour for a thrilling zip-line adrenaline rush.",north america,,
kenya,"Lions and leopards are just part of the landscape in Kenya, one of East Africa's favourite safari destination. More than 40 national parks and nature reserves are scattered between Lake Victoria and the Indian Ocean, covering every imaginable landscape and featuring just about every animal in Africa: from aardvarks to zebras.      As you might expect, wildlife safaris are the lifeblood of Kenyan tourism, and the infrastructure for travellers is impressive. Jeeps, buses and light aircraft fan out daily across the country to safari lodges and tented camps, some simple and rustic, others lavish and opulent. Refreshingly, you can enjoy close encounters with nature even on a budget, with walking safaris run by tribal guides and economic-tented camps that scrimp on creature comforts, but not on creatures.      Most people start their journey in Nairobi, Kenya's capital city, but few linger when there are more attractive cities strung out along the sun-kissed Kenyan coast and dotted around the Great Rift Valley. Whether you pick the interior or the coast (with its beach resorts and Islamic ruins), you can be sure to find a national park or reserve close at hand. Even Nairobi has a national park within the city limits, with zebras and giraffes just a stone's throw from the suburbs.      Kenya is also a great place for cultural encounters, with more than 40 different tribal groups, each following its own unique way of life. The semi-nomadic Maasai tribe, with their multi-coloured, bead-covered adornments, is perhaps the most obvious group, but visiting any tribal village is a fascinating and enlightening experience.      On appearances, Kenya would seem like the perfect holiday destination, but tourism has had its ups and downs in recent years, with political upheaval during elections and a string of high-profile militant attacks in Nairobi and along the coast.      These setbacks have made a noticeable dent in Kenya's tourist industry, yet travellers still flock to the teeming plains of the Maasai Mara and trek the slopes of Mount Kenya, and the biggest decision for most is not whether to go to Kenya, but instead, which wild animal to search for first.","Kenya  Attractions in Kenya  Amboseli National Park: witness a wealth of wildlife  The 392sq km (151sq mile) Amboseli National Park lies at the base of snow-capped Kilimanjaro, Africa's highest peak. Wildlife includes lion, cheetah, wildebeest, hippo and gazelle, but the park is most famous for the large herds of African bush elephants which are attracted to the swamps. Bird watching is popular, and visitors can learn about the local Maasai people through homestead visits.  Elsamere: indulge in traditional high tea  Situated on the shores of Lake Naivasha, the former residence of the famous conservationists, George and Joy Adamson is now a museum and conservation research centre. This museum depicts the life of the couple that raised an orphaned lion, Elsa, before returning it to the wild. The story of Elsa became a famous movie, Born Free, and their house now caters for study groups and tourists. Set in beautiful grounds teeming with birds, Elsamere also serves excellent high tea.  Explore Lamu Town: the oldest Swahili settlement in East Africa  Set on a picturesque offshore island close to the Somali border, Lamu is a charming old Swahili city and UNESCO World Heritage Site with many historic mosques and fine old Arab houses complete with impressive carved wooden doors. Highlights of the town include the Lamu Museum, the Swahili House Museum and Lamu Fort.  Kakamega Forest: go twitching  The only rainforest in Kenya, this lovely spot near the Ugandan border is arguably the prime bird watching site in the country, thanks to the presence of several dozen forest species found nowhere else in the country. For non-birders, the shady forest paths and plentiful monkeys offer lots of charm.  Kenya's coral coast: seek out aquatic activities  Visitors can choose between scuba diving, snorkelling, sailing, water-skiing, swimming or surfing along Kenya's coral coast. The most popular resorts near Mombasa include Bamburi, Kikambala, Kilifi, Malindi, Nyali and the 17km (11 miles) long, dazzlingly white Diani Beach.  Laikipia Plateau: game sanctuaries  Discover an expansive area of traditional ranches and rolling farmland that has been converted into game sanctuaries, which are stocked with big game, including the Big Five: elephant, buffalo, lion, rhino and leopard. Kenya's highest population of endangered species, including black rhino and Grevy’s zebras, can be spotted roaming across these vast plains. The old farmsteads now serve as charming and luxurious accommodation.  Lake Nakuru National Park: a bird lover's paradise  Boasting a dramatic setting in the Rift Valley, this park is dominated by a lake whose edges are frequently home to hundreds of thousands of pink flamingos. It is also one of Kenya's best rhino sanctuaries, supporting high concentrations of both black and white rhino, and you may spot a leopard in the giant yellowwood acacia trees.  Lake Turkana: the world's largest permanent desert lake  In the barren northern reaches of Kenya, Lake Turkana is a strange and beautiful oasis, known to locals as the Jade Sea due to its size and striking jade colour. The lake provides great fishing and birding, while the islands are breeding habitats for crocodiles, hippos and several snake species. The semi-nomadic Turkana tribe are native to the Turkana County in the semi-arid climate region bordering Lake Turkana in the east, and have a history as interesting as the lake itself.  Masai Mara: experience an African adventure  Kenya's most popular game park is named after the Masai tribe, who migrated south from the lower Nile Valley between the 17th century and late 18th century. A northern extension to Tanzania's Serengeti Plains, it is one of the best places in Africa for seeing lion, cheetah and leopard, but is most famous for the annual wildebeest migration and dramatic crossing of the crocodile-infested Mara River between July to October.      Taking to the skies in a hot air balloon is one of the best ways to experience Masai Mara, particularly during the annual migration. Almost all the lodges in the reserve offer this experience.         Mombasa: marvel at this coastal city   Enjoy this coastal city's amalgamation of cultures and its narrow, crowded streets in the Old Town. Spend an evening afloat on a romantic dhow (a traditional Arab sailing boat), feasting on delicious seafood and watching the moon rise over Mombasa's Old Harbour. Don’t forget to catch the sound and light show at Fort Jesus, which was built by the Portuguese at the end of the 16th century to protect the town from outside invaders and is now a museum and UNESCO World Heritage Site.  Mount Kenya: climb Kenya's highest mountain   At 5,199m (17,057ft) above sea level, this extinct volcano is the second-highest mountain in Africa after Kilimanjaro. The Mountain Club of Kenya runs mountain huts and publishes guides for climbers. Even if you don't climb to the upper slopes, it is worth spending time on the forested lower slopes below the ice-capped peak, where interesting wildlife abounds.  Mount Longonot: climb a dormant volcano   This distinctive volcano, which last erupted in 1863, rises dramatically above the Rift Valley floor, and is 2,776 m (9,108 ft) tall. There is a trail that runs from the park entrance up to the crater rim, which takes about 4-5 hours in total to complete.  Nairobi National Park: take a day trip  Nairobi National Park, only 8km (5 miles) from the city centre, is Kenya's oldest national park. Today, it still looks much as it did in the early photographs, with wild, undulating pasture supporting most of East Africa's best-known wildlife, including lion, rhino, giraffe, buffalo and zebra, and over 400 recorded species of bird.  Nairobi: tour the museums for a dose of culture   Browse the ethnographic and archaeological exhibits of the National Museum, which lies within walking distance of the city centre. And then head out to the suburban Karen Blixen Museum, which occupies the farmhouse made famous by the author's book, Out of Africa, which inspired a Hollywood film of the same name. The house preserves much of the original items by its famous dweller. The Nairobi Railway Museum also covers an important chapter of the city's history, featuring exhibits from the defunct East African Railways.  Taita Hills Wildlife Sanctuary: stay overnight in a natural haven   Situated a 6-hour drive from Nairobi or a 4-hour drive from Mombasa, this private sanctuary bordering the vast Tsavo National Park doubles as a luxury hotel and well-positioned hide, overlooking a salt lick and a waterhole that frequently attracts aggregations of a hundred or more elephants.  The David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust’s Elephant Orphanage: make a difference  Watch baby elephants play in mud baths at this orphanage for elephants, which is situated in Nairobi National Park. This important sanctuary cares for and rehabilitates orphaned elephants, rhinos and giraffes before they are released back into the wild. Entrance to the sanctuary requires a contribution, and there is a digital foster program that allows people across the world to foster an orphaned elephant, rhino or giraffe. In return of donation, an individual will receive a personalised certificate, a monthly update on the progress of their orphan and an interactive map.",africa,,
hawaii,"Smouldering volcanoes, tropical rainforests, idyllic beaches, legendary surf and blistering sunshine: you need a good excuse not to visit Hawaii.      Oahu, home to the state capital Honolulu, is the most popular island. Big-wave surfing took off here in the 1950s and the pros still pilgrimage to Waimea Bay for its epic swells. You don't have to be a veteran boarder to take advantage of the conditions, though: Waikiki Beach offers an easier ride for those still finding their feet.      The second largest of Hawaii’s islands, Maui seems to win every best beach award going. But those looking to sizzle on the sand will struggle to beat Makena Beach, which is a regular Instagram star. If you’re not content lounging by the shore, ascend nearby Haleakalā, the island’s highest peak, to marvel at some exquisite panoramas.      Just across the water, tiny Lanai’s luxury resorts and golf courses may bleed your wallet dry, but go for the day and you can rumble across lunar like landscapes in a 4-wheel drive, gaze at ghostly shipwrecks, and hike through virgin rainforests. Unspoiled Molokai is also a short ferry hop from Maui and lays claim to the world’s highest sea cliffs.      Visitors can get as close as they dare to an active volcano on Hawaii Island, where hyperactive Kilauea of Hawaii Volcanoes National Park has been spewing copious amounts of lava every day since 1983.      And then there’s Kauai, Hawaii’s northernmost island.

ibiza,"Although Ibiza has long been synonymous with fun in the sun hedonism, a trip to the island is not all about sultry clubs and all-night raves – away from the bright lights there’s a quieter side to the so-called ‘White Isle’.      But first to the merrymaking, because make no mistake this Spanish haven is one of the foremost party destinations in Europe. During the summer, superstar DJs arrive en masse to entertain the millions of partyers who come for the quintessential boho-glam vibes of this sun-kissed island.      Ibiza Town is a hotbed of late-night revelry. The municipality is home to the world-famous clubs Pacha and Amnesia, which share quaint cobblestone streets with more traditional attractions such as Santa Maria d’Eivissa Cathedral.      Sant Antoni de Portmany (San Antonio) is the real clubbing capital, though. The so-called ‘Sunset Strip’ is renowned for its rowdy clubs and spectacular skies. Millions flock to witness resident DJs ‘put the sun to bed’ as they sip expensive cocktails and bliss out to party-perfect tunes. For sophisticates, there are a host of alternatives nearby, with chic bars offering expensive mélanges of spirits and exquisite sunset views.

Puig des Molins  The archaeological site of the Puig des Molins, situated at the foot of the mountain of the same name, has been the cemetery of Ibiza since the foundation of the city by Occidental Phoenicians, at the end of the 7th century BC. The burial grounds are spread over a hill (puig) dotted with olive trees and you can make a descent into one of the interconnecting burial chambers.  Sant Antoni de Portmany, Pikes Hotel  After going through some financial difficulties, legendary Pikes Hotel was sold, refurbished and rebranded but it’s still where the rich and famous hang out. Wham's 'Club Tropicana' video was filmed around the pool, and though drinks are far from free, you can still breathe in the atmosphere left by guests such as Kylie Minogue, Freddie Mercury, Grace Jones and Ed Sheeran, to name but a few.  Santa Rafel  The village is the island's main centre for pottery and the only artisan zone on Ibiza. Traditional pottery shops line the streets, and authentic workshops churn out crafts, using old traditional Mediterranean techniques. A good choice of shops will be happy to sell you their beautiful wares whilst you enjoy the views of nearby Ibiza Old Town.",europe,spain,balearic islands
st vincent and the grenadines,"Scattered across the Caribbean Sea like so many emeralds, St Vincent & the Grenadines is a glorious-looking archipelago. The country’s name makes it sound like an old soul band, and aptly there’s something timeless about the place. Lush mountain peaks, white sands, secluded coves, volcanic landscapes and spectacular coral reefs all go towards making this one of the region’s most diverse spots. For hikers, sailors and those who just fancy kicking back in wave-lapped sunshine for a week or two, it’s some proposition.      The country, which found Hollywood fame when it was used as a setting for the Pirates of the Caribbean films, is made up of 32 islands and cays. St Vincent itself is by far the largest, and has a laid-back capital city, Kingstown, to show for it. Colonial architecture, botanical gardens and a fish market are among the attractions. The latter hints at the dishes that dominate the archipelago’s food scene – fresh seafood, usually washed down with a cold Hairoun beer, is a speciality. Elsewhere on St Vincent there’s some fantastic walking to be had, most notably the trail that leads up to La Soufrière volcano.      The smaller islands that make up the Grenadines offer an even quieter pace of life. Among the most appealing spots are Bequia, which has good claim to that overused adage “the Caribbean as it used to be,” and Mustique, a long-established A-list bolthole that has welcomed the likes of Mick Jagger, Kate Moss and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.      The best way to experience the outlying islands is to hop between them by boat, and the country as a whole has near-legendary status in the yachting community. The most obvious focal point on a sailing trip is the stupendously scenic Tobago Cays, which is made up of five uninhabited islands and offers excellent potential for divers and snorkelers.","St Vincent and the Grenadines  Attractions in St Vincent and the Grenadines  Bequia  Visit Bequia, an island 14km (9 miles) south of St Vincent and the largest of the Grenadines. Observe Bequia's age-old traditions of boat building and fishing, largely retained due to its seclusion. In the marine park, spearfishing, snares and nets are prohibited. The islanders themselves are the world's last hand-harpooners and their activities do not affect marine stocks.  Boat builders  Watch men building their boats by hand in Admiralty Bay, Bequia's natural harbour and a favourite anchoring spot for yachtsmen from all over the world. The attractive region around Lower Bay has good opportunities for swimming and other watersports.  Botanical Gardens  Take in the oldest Botanical Gardens in the western hemisphere, which occupy 8.1 hectares (20 acres) to the north of Kingstown, St Vincent, and contain a display of tropical trees, blossoms and plants, including a breadfruit tree descended from the original one brought to the island in 1765 by Captain Bligh.  Canouan beaches  Take in the beautiful beaches on Canouan. The island claims some of the best in the Caribbean with long stretches of powder-white sands, wide shallows and coral.  Falls of Baleine  Take a boat trip to the Falls of Baleine, at the northern tip of St Vincent. The 18m (59ft) freshwater falls stream from volcanic slopes and form a series of shallow pools at the base.  Fishing villages  Head to the fishing villages of Questelles, Layou, Barrouallie and Châteaubelair, all of which have charming pastel-coloured cottages and excellent black-sand beaches from which fishermen set out daily in small brightly painted boats.  Kingstown  Visit the lively port and market town of Kingstown; the capital of St Vincent. The town contains 12 small blocks with a variety of shops and a busy dock area, which is the centre of commerce for the islands. The Saturday morning market, comprising many stalls piled high with fresh fruit and vegetables, brings everyone to town.  Luxurious Mustique  Mustique, a gem in the ocean taking up only 4.5 sq km (2 sq miles). Mustique is privately owned, with a landscape as gentle as its lifestyle - verdant hills roll into soft white-sand beaches and turquoise waters. This island has long been a hiding place for the rich and famous, including members of the British Royal Family.  Mount Parnassus  Head to Mount Parnassus on Union Island, which soars 275m (900ft) from the sea guarding the entrance to the southern Grenadines. The 850-hectare (2,100-acre) mountainous island is fringed by superb beaches and is the stopping-off point for yachtsmen and visitors heading to some of the smaller Grenadines. Clifton Harbour, the main town, is small and commercial.  St Mary's Roman Catholic Cathedral  Head to the centre of Kingstown where you will find St Mary's Roman Catholic Cathedral. Built of grey stone, it is a graceful combination of several European architectural styles displaying Romanesque arches, gothic spires and Moorish ornamentation. Its architecture has led Kingstown to become known as the City of Arches.  Tobago Cays  Head to the numerous islets and coves of the Tobago Cays where you can see some of the most spectacular coral reefs in the world. Visitors can sail, snorkel and beachcomb in complete seclusion. The only way to get here is by chartered yacht.  Volcanic hiking  Hike up La Soufrière volcano (1,200m/4,000ft) in the north of St Vincent, which is popular, though strenuous. The 5km (3 mile) journey rewards you with a wonderful bird's-eye view of the crater and its islands, and all of St Vincent.  Watery pursuits  Hit the water and try some sailing, scuba diving or snorkelling on Bequiam which is encircled by gold-sand beaches, many of which disappear into coves. Lodgings vary from luxurious resort cottages to small, simple West Indian inns. Much of the nightlife centres on the hotels and beachside barbecues, invariably accompanied by a steel band.  Young Island  Visit Young Island, which is only 180m (590ft) off St Vincent and rises from the sea to form a mountain blanketed with tropical foliage and blossoms. Young Island provides an excellent view of the procession of yachts sailing into the harbour of St Vincent. The entire island comprises one resort called Young Island Resort, which consists of 29 rustic cottages set on the beaches and hillsides.",caribbean,,
st kitts and nevis,"Palm-fringed beaches? Check. Limpid lagoons? Check. Tropical rainforests? Check. The twin-island nation of St Kitts and Nevis embodies everything travellers have come to expect from the Caribbean, except, that is, for the crowds.  Somehow, this vibrant island state has remained under the radar of mass tourism, carving out a niche as an alternative destination for those looking to avoid more mainstream Caribbean islands.  The smallest sovereign state in the Americas, St Kitts and Nevis are compact and easy to navigate, which is just as well because the pace of life here is slow – and proudly so.  St. Kitts is the larger and more developed of the two and is home to the laidback capital, Basseterre, a former colonial outpost renowned for its historical monuments, vibrant markets and lively beach life.  Dominated by Mount Liamuiga, a dormant volcano carpeted with verdant rainforest, Kitts is also home to the defunct British fortress, Brimstone Hill, one of the best preserved citadels in the Americas and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  Remnants of the sugar cane industry, once the beating heart of the Kitts economy, remain; old sugar plantations have found new lives as bijous hotels and restaurants, while the island's narrow-gauge railway, once used to transport the cane, has become a popular attraction.  And then there's Nevis. Fanned by trade winds and dominated by an active volcano, this island is the quieter of the two. The scenery remains relatively unchanged by progress; its undulating landscape punctuated by plantation-style hotels which offer lazy lunches and charming lodgings.  Those looking for something more adventurous can pass the days hiking through forests, pedalling down mountain trails or surveying the island's coral reefs, which are popular with scuba divers and snorkelers.  There is little competition for space on Nevis' powdery beaches, and, for the discerning gastronome, there are plenty of excellent restaurants to choose from.  St Kitts and Nevis will, alas, not stay under the radar forever. The authorities are keen to boost tourism and those familiar with this corner of the Caribbean will be hoping they do it without diluting the islands' many charms.","St Kitts And Nevis  Attractions in St Kitts And Nevis  Check out the sub-aquatic sights  Snorkelers and scuba divers will find plenty of interesting sights below the waves, including a rare opportunity to dive on a black coral reef. Also, among the hundreds of shipwrecks around the islands are the freighters River Taw and M.V. Talata, which are popular sites. Sharks and turtles are relatively abundant and can often be seen on dives.  Climb Mount Liamuiga  Lofty Mount Liamuiga is a supposedly extinct volcano at the centre of St. Kitts (some believe it is merely dormant). Standing 1,156m (3,792ft), the mountain is covered in farmland at the foothills, rainforest in lower elevations and cloud forest towards the summit.    A lake partially fills the 1,000-foot-deep volcanic crater, which can be reached by a series of hiking trails; the strenuous, two-hour climb is rewarded by panoramic views of neighbouring islands.  Don your hiking boots  There are many hiking trails leading into the mountains and through the islands' verdant rainforests. Local guides can be arranged through hotels, but experienced ramblers can tackle the trails solo. On St. Kitts, the summit of Mt. Liamuiga represents a popular challenge for hikers, while Nevis Peak offers a similar experience.  Experience bustling Basseterre  Basseterre, the picturesque capital of St Kitts and Nevis, retains the flavour of both French and British occupation. The latter’s influence is felt most around Independence Square, which is surrounded by beautiful Georgian buildings.    Although small – Basseterre has a population of approximately 16,000 – the city is the main commercial and industrial centre on the islands. It hosts regular markets, cricket matches and is home to landmarks including St George's Anglican Church, Basseterre Co-Cathedral of Immaculate Conception and The National Museum, housed in the Treasury Building.  Explore Brimstone Hill  One of the best preserved citadels in the Caribbean, Brimstone Hill is a defunct British fort and now a UNESCO World Heritage site. It was once dubbed 'The Gibraltar of the West Indies' as it was impenetrable during many Anglo-French maritime battles. Surrounded by former sugar plantations, the fort commands splendid views across the limpid Caribbean waters and is home to a rich variety of flora and fauna including vervet monkeys.  Frolic in limpid waters  Come on in, the water is lovely. St Kitts and Nevis boasts some of the cleanest seawater in the Caribbean. The water is warm and mostly calm, too, which makes it great not only for swimming, but other watersports such as sailing, water skiing and deep sea fishing.  Gallop through the rainforest  Horse riding in the rainforest or along the beach can be arranged through various hotels and tour operators across the islands.  Get on your bike  You can rent bikes on St. Kitts or Nevis, but Nevis is the more bike-friendly of the two islands, with less traffic, fewer hills and a 20-mile road circling the island. Nevis by bike is a great way to see the island at a comfortable speed; both St. Kitts and Nevis also have ample mountain-biking trails to explore.  Hone your horticulture knowledge  Flowering orchids and flamboyant bushes are among the visual highlights at The Botanical Gardens of Nevis (tel: 869 469 3509; www.botanicalgardensnevis.com). These pretty gardens incorporate a rainforest conservatory – modelled on Palm House at Kew Gardens in London – which is alive with butterflies and parrots. The on-site restaurant serves Thai cuisine at lunchtime and houses an art gallery devoted to the ‘first lady of Nevisian art’ Eva Wilkin.  Hop aboard the scenic railway  Completed in 1926, this narrow-gauge railway was originally used to transport sugar cane from the island’s plantations to a processing factory located in Basseterre. When the sugar industry was mothballed, the line was converted into a scenic railway (tel: 869 465 7263; www.stkittsscenicrailway.com).    Tours begin in Basseterre and take approximately three hours, covering 18 miles by rail and 12 miles by bus. The picturesque route circumnavigates the island and takes in most of the island’s sites, including Brimstone Hill, Mount Liamuiga and some of the larger sugarcane estates.  Imbibe local history  Four thousand years of human history on Nevis are detailed in the Museum of Nevis History in Charlestown. Housed in a Georgian style home, the museum's exhibits include pre-European artefacts, information about local conservation efforts, a timeline of the island's political history, as well as architectural and cultural information. The museum also celebrates famous local residents, which included Horatio Nelson and American Founding Father, Alexander Hamilton.  Saunter around Charlestown  The charming capital of Nevis is characterised by its wooden buildings, friendly ambiance and brilliant blooms of bougainvillaea. The town is peppered with historical monuments and attractions such as the Cotton Ginnery, Alexander Hamilton's birthplace (now a museum), the Court House, the War Memorial and the Jewish Cemetery.    It’s also home to a number of old plantation houses which have been transformed into superb hotels and restaurants.  Shake your booty in Frigate Bay  Frigate Bay is the main resort area on St Kitts and boasts two fine beaches, numerous hotels, a golf course and a casino. Known as ‘The Strip,’ it consists of a series of popular beach bars and is the island’s nightlife hub.    Frigate Bay North is home to a smattering of beach resorts and holiday homes, while Frigate Bay South is more popular with locals.  Soak in the rays on Pinney's Beach  Located north of Charlestown is Pinney's Beach, arguably one of the finest on the island. This expanse of silver sand, lined with palm trees and beach bars, is probably the most popular stretch of sand on the island.    For something a little bit wilder, head further north to Black Sand Beach and Hurricane Hill, which offer stunning vistas across St Kitts and Barbuda.  Step back in time at Romney Manor  This 17th century former sugar estate is now home to Caribelle Batik, St Kitts (tel: 869 465 6253; www.caribellebatikstkitts.com), an artisanal workshop that produces vivid fabrics and fine garments for men and women. Visitors can take tours of Romney Manor, learning about the sugar and rum production process, and finding out more about the estate's previous owners, which include Sam Jefferson II (a relative of American Founding Father, Thomas Jefferson).  Walk the Nevis Heritage Trail  Many of Nevis’ historic attractions are found along the road which circles the island. This road forms part of the official Heritage Trail, which takes visitors to the abandoned British citadel, Fort Charles, the Hermitage Estate, now a boutique inn, and a pair of Anglican churches (St. John’s and St. Paul’s).    The Saddle Hill fortress, near Montpelier Plantation, is known locally as ‘Nelson’s Lookout,’ and is well preserved and worth a detour. The trail begins and ends in Charlestown.",caribbean,,
tanzania,"If you close your eyes and conjure up the quintessential romantic image of Africa, what you’ll most likely imagine is Tanzania: the drama of the wildebeest migration along a seemingly-endless savannah; the incongruous snow and glaciers of Mt Kilimanjaro; the iconic and statuesque Maasai warriors; the exotic palm-fringed beaches on the spice islands of Zanzibar. It’s all here.      Tanzania boasts some of the most impressive national parks and game reserves in Africa. The Serengeti National Park is considered the continent’s premier spot to see wildlife roam unheeded across vast open plains.      Nearby, within the steep walls of the Ngorongoro Crater lies the most densely concentrated population of African mammals on earth. Not to be forgotten, the Selous Game Reserve is larger than Switzerland, and is wild, remote and still virtually untouched by humans.      Even further from the beaten path are parks in the extreme west of the country which offer the unique opportunity to track chimpanzees in their natural habitat on the fringes of Lake Tanganyika, one of Africa’s Great Lakes.      Beyond its safari stalwarts, Tanzania has no less than 804km (503 miles) of sublime coastline and pearly-white beaches with some magnificent islands offshore. Known as the Swahili Coast, this was a favoured stop on ancient trading routes between the Indian sub-continent and the Middle East. Spices, jewels and slaves once passed through, bringing with them a mélange of cultural riches that remain today.      Tanzania’s not short on mountains either. The striking and snow-capped Mt Kilimanjaro is Africa's tallest at 5,895m (19,341ft) and climbing it is an unforgettable experience. Its slightly smaller sister Mt Meru is arguably even prettier, and a quicker climb.      Tanzania is home to more than 120 different ethnic groups and cultures, but it has seen little of the ethnic or religious-based violence that has afflicted certain other nations in the region. In fact the country is an inherently peaceful place and embraces its multicultural heritage, which adds to its broad appeal.","Tanzania  Attractions in Tanzania  Conquer Mount Kilimanjaro  As the highest mountain in Africa at 5,895m (19,341 ft), Kilimanjaro has tempted avid explorers with its snow-capped peak for decades. Reaching the top is no walk in the park, but anyone of reasonable fitness can do it. Well-organised six-, seven- or eight-day climbs include guides, porters, food and equipment. Watching the sunrise from the summit is an indescribable spectacle.  Experience wilderness seclusion at Selous Game Reserve  For a truly remote wildlife adventure, head to an isolated lodge in the Selous Game Reserve. This UNESCO World Heritage Site covers an area larger than Switzerland (about one-sixth of Tanzania's land surface), making it one of the biggest reserves in the world. It is home to a plethora of African animals, and is renowned for its exceptionally large elephant herds.  Explore Lake Manyara National Park  Lake Manyara is easily seen from the road that climbs up the Rift Valley, where safari vehicles stop to gawk at the pink flamingos. Once inside the park, there are tracks through the oasis of lush greenery, with the algae-streaked lake on one side and baobab-strewn cliffs on the other. Manyara is famous for its tree-climbing lions, and elephant are easily spotted too.  Feel the beautiful isolation of Lake Natron  The isolated and beautiful Lake Natron is a lesser-known gem on Tanzania's feted Northern Circuit. The shallow moon-like surface of this salt and soda lake is home to more than two million lesser flamingos, while the surrounding Rift Valley escarpment lends itself to dramatic vistas. Tourism remains delightfully underdeveloped here, though you're just a few hours from Arusha.  Have a history lesson at the National Museum  Located next to the Botanical Gardens in Dar es Salaam, the National Museum reveals the fascinating history and culture of this ancient region, and features the 1.7-million-year-old skull of Nutcracker Man. Peacocks stroll the gardens, where there is a striking sculpture in memory of victims of the 1998 Dar es Salaam US Embassy bombing.  Meander around Moshi  Beneath the snow-capped peak of Kilimanjaro sits the small, charming and verdant town of Moshi, worth exploring either before or after conquering Africa's highest mountain. Unfailingly laidback, Moshi has some good restaurants and a colourful market; it's also the centre of one of Tanzania's major coffee-growing regions, with coffee tours available run by many local operators.  Peruse Mwenge Carvers' Market  Located 8km (5 miles) north of Dar es Salaam on the way to the northern beaches, this fascinating market has vendors selling their beautiful handmade wares. This is the place to buy famous Makonde woodcarvings – the Makonde people are considered to be some of the finest carvers in East Africa.  Reach the summit of Mount Meru  The lower slopes of Mount Meru (4566m/14980ft) in Arusha National Park are one of the most easily accessible places to spot buffalo, giraffe, black and white colobus monkey and warthog. The three-day trek to the summit of the striking mountain is an equally challenging and cheaper option than climbing Kilimanjaro, though far less popular.  Relax on Zanzibar's beaches  Zanzibar's magnificent swathes of palm-backed white sandy beaches make for a wonderful beach getaway. The many resorts (from simple beach cottages to 5-star luxury) offer a range of activities, such as diving, snorkelling and sunset cruises on white-sailed dhows. Fine seafood and a cold sundowner are never far away.  Safari in the Serengeti  The Serengeti is undoubtedly the most iconic national park in all of Africa, and a safari through the astonishing endless plains is an absolute must on any visit to Tanzania, especially during the famed wildebeest migration (roughly November to May). Close sightings of the Big Five (lion, elephant, buffalo, leopard and rhino) are almost guaranteed.  Scuba dive off the Swahili Coast  The technicolour marine life surrounding the idyllic coral islands of Zanzibar and Pemba makes them a hotspot for scuba diving. There are countless dive sites around the islands, which are protected as marine national parks and reserves. The warm Indian Ocean has clear visibility to see all kinds of coral, brightly coloured fish, dolphins, manta rays, turtles and sharks.  See the Great Migration from the air  The endless plains of the Serengeti come to life in the early hours of dawn. Seeing the park wake with the rising sun from a hot air balloon is one of the world's great natural spectacles. The annual migration of some two million wildebeest followed by their predators, roughly from November to May, is the best time to hitch a ride.  Spot the Big Five in Ngorongoro Crater  At 610m (2,000 ft) deep, 20km (12.5 miles) wide, the Ngorongoro Crater is the largest intact caldera in the world. Another of Tanzania's UNESCO World Heritage Sites, the crater is packed with almost every species of African plains mammal including the densest lion population in Africa.  Stroll through Stone Town  Zanzibar's Stone Town was the hub of the ancient spice trade, and once served as the maritime metropolis of East Africa, variously ruled by Shirazi Persians, the Portuguese, the Omani Arabs and British. Today, this UNESCO World Heritage Site remains a labyrinth of narrow, winding streets lined with exotic shops, bazaars, colonial mansions, mosques and squares.  Take a trip back in time at Bagamoyo  The ancient town of Bagamoyo was a one-time slave port and terminus for the trade caravans. The town mosque and Arab tombs date from the 18th century, while there are a number of churches and mission buildings dating from the 19th century and later buildings from when the Germans occupied the town. Pick up a guide for a walk around the town, which is an easy day excursion from Dar es Salaam.  Take in the beauty of Tarangire National Park  The Tarangire National Park, only 130km (80 miles) from Arusha is easily accessible but often overlooked in favour of the better-known Northern Circuit parks. However, a game drive here rewards with unusual scenery of giant silver-trunked baobab trees, and the Tarangire River is a favourite haunt for wildebeest, zebra, eland and elephant.  Track chimpanzees on Lake Tanganyika  Troops of wild chimpanzees thrive in the Gombe Stream and Mahale national parks on the shores of Lake Tanganyika. Both parks have spectacular scenery with mountains and forested valleys plunging into the lake, and both are among just a small handful of places in Africa to see chimps in their natural habitat. Treks can be arranged to follow the troops, with sightings almost guaranteed.  Walk on the wild side in Ruaha National Park  One of only a handful of parks in Tanzania that allows walking safaris, Ruaha National Park boasts unparalleled scenery. It's Tanzania's second-largest park, and it's also one of its wildest. Ruaha is known for its exceptionally large herds of elephant and buffalo and is also one of the best places in Tanzania to see the critically-endangered African wild dog.  Watch bull fighting on Pemba  The pretty and pristine island of Pemba is famed for its own traditional brand of bull fighting. Unlike its Spanish counterpart, this hangover from the days of Portuguese rule in the 16th and 17th centuries does not involve killing the bulls, and is a test of bravery for local livestock farmers.",africa,,

mauritania,"Mauritania’s is a lonely beauty. A land of endless deserts, empty coastlines and spectacular birdlife, it is lays claim to some of the most spectacular scenery in Africa and a fascinating population comprised of Arab-Berbers and black Africans.      Arguably the jewel in Mauritania’s crown is the Banc d’Arguin, where the Sahara Desert slips silently into the Atlantic Ocean. This is nirvana for twitchers, particularly during the European winter, when more than two million migratory birds descend on the national park. The Banc d’Arguin is also home to the Imraguen fishermen, who catch their quarry with a little help from local dolphins.      The Mauritanian coastline is a bleak and beautiful place, an empty shore littered with the occasional shipwreck or whale skeleton. Miraculously, one of the last remaining Mediterranean monk seal colonies can be found living around Cap Blanc, where there is a small nature reserve dedicated to protecting this endangered species.      Inland lies the oasis settlement of Ouadâne. Concealed by coloured sand dunes, this ghost town was once a centre for intellectual thinking and its private libraries contain thousands of ancient scholarly manuscripts. It’s also home to the crumbling remains of a 14th century mosque, which dominates this UNESCO-listed town. Nearby Chinguetti, the seventh holiest city of Islam, is also worth a visit.      Nouakchott, the capital, is hot and dusty and doesn’t have very much to recommend it besides a few French restaurants and bustling markets. The best thing to do in town is to watch local fishermen land their catch at Port de Peche, where every evening a colourful mass of people haul nets, carry fish and drag brightly painted boats out of the waves, singing songs as they go. It’s one of Mauritania’s many simple pleasures.","Mauritania  Attractions in Mauritania  Cool off in a desert oasis  Visit Atâr, capital of the Adrar Region, an oasis lying on the route of salt caravans. It is the market centre for the nomads of northern Mauritania and has an old quarter, the Ksar, with flat-roofed houses and a fine palm grove.  Explore the coast  Mauritania's coast is essentially one long sandy beach that's almost devoid of vegetation, but supports an astonishingly varied population of birds. Inland, the landscape is empty desert. If you have a 4x4 vehicle it is possible to drive along the beach, tide depending.  Go birdwatching in the Parc National du Banc d'Arguin  Mauritania's best attraction is the spectacular Parc National du Banc d'Arguin. A vast area of islands and coastline located on the Atlantic coast, it is one of the world's largest bird sanctuaries and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. There are also several archaeological sites on the islands.  Kick back in Nouâdhibou  Discover the port town of Nouâdhibou, the centre of Mauritania's fishing industry, which is situated on a peninsula at the northern end of the Bay of Levrier. Attractions include bustling markets, the resident monk seals and a ship graveyard.  Make the most of the Atlantic  Mauritania has a long Atlantic coastline and visitors should make the most of the water. There are good spots for fishing, swimming and surfing along the coast in the west. Remote and deserted beaches can be found near Nouâdhibou, but there is a risk of landmines in the area so take local advice.  Spot a rare monk seal  The monk seal is an endangered species and one of the last and largest remaining colonies is on the Cap Blanc peninsular in Mauritania. They are relatively large seals with adults weighing 300kg or more. If you are lucky you can see seals from the cliffs.  Stroll around Nouakchott  The capital city, Nouakchott, was created in 1960, but maintains the traditional Berber style of architecture. It lies near the sea in a desert landscape of low dunes and adjoins the Ksar, an old Moorish settlement. Don't miss the Plage du Wharf, the Ksar and its market, the African market and the camel market, the crafts centre, the Maison de la Culture and the carpet factory.  Take in some archaeological sites  Tour the Affolé and Assaba regions, south and southeast of the Tagant, via Kiffa, Tamchakett and Ayoun el Atrous, to the wild plateaux of El Agher. Interesting archaeological sites include Koumbi Saleh, once capital of the Ghana Empire, 70km (45 miles) from Timbedra.  Visit a fortified medieval town  See the UNESCO World Heritage Site at Oualata, once among the greatest caravan markets of the Sahara. A fortified medieval town built in terraces up a rocky peak, it has for centuries been a place of refuge for scholars. There is a manuscript museum with examples of calligraphy on ancient scrolls. Tirzet and its Muslim cemetery are nearby.  Visit a holy city  Take an excursion over the breath-taking mountain pass of Homogjar to Chinguetti, a holy city of Islam founded in the 13th century and now listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

As the largest country in Africa, Algeria’s terrain is hugely varied yet underexplored: few visitors travel beyond the country’s Mediterranean port cities (namely Oran and the capital, Algiers), which lie amidst fertile land and the scattered vestiges of Phoenician and Roman colonies.      Sometimes called ‘Algiers the White,’ the capital’s bustling showpiece is its UNESCO-listed Casbah. This whitewashed medina encompasses both crumbling ruins and newly-renovated spaces and is well worth a visit despite its shady reputation (taking a guide is recommended).      The ancient port city of Oran has a decidedly European vibe: French colonial influences are evident in everything from the soaring Sacré-Cœur Cathedral (now a library) to the richly ornamented Palais de la Culture. The city has long been a popular trading post and remains one of the busiest ports in North Africa.      The Sahara Desert is Algeria’s defining feature and one of its biggest drawing cards. It covers more than four-fifths of the country and is the source of myriad myths and legends. Nomadic Berbers still live here, eking out traditional lives in difficult conditions.      The security situation makes independent travel difficult in the Sahara, but under the guidance of reputable tour operators, travellers can visit attractions like the oasis towns of Ghardia and Timimoun, or venture deep into the heart of the desert to view the prehistoric rock art in the Hoggar Mountains and Tassili N’Ajjer National Park.       The desert is also home to the world’s most remote film festival. FiSahara takes place annually in the Wilaya of Dakhla, a Western Sahara refugee camp, to highlight the plight of the Sahrawi people.     War and tumultuous politics have deterred many from visiting Algeria – rerouting them towards Morocco instead – but if you’re looking for a North African destination with a difference, this country has much to offer.","Algeria  Attractions in Algeria  Admire attractive Algiers  Algeria's pretty capital has been a port since Roman times and although commercialised by the French in the mid 19th century, it still has the feel of the Maghreb to it, with many zig-zag alleyways, mosques and a fantastic casbah. It's also evocative of French colonialism with its whitewashed façades and blue painted balconies.  Buy a carpet in gorgeous Ghardaia  Made up of three very different walled towns in this fertile valley surrounded by the Saharan sands, Ghardaia is a unique place. The old towns are ultra-religious and can only be visited with an official guide, but it's well worth doing so. Don't leave without a carpet – those on sale in the main square of Ghardaia are considered to be the best in the country and make superb souvenirs from any trip to Algeria. Haggle with the carpet sellers here to get a good price.  Discover the ‘enchanted oasis’  Deep in the Grand Erg Occidental desert region, lies the oasis town of El Goléa, which is often referred to as 'the pearl of the desert' or 'the enchanted oasis' because of its luxuriant vegetation and abundant water. The town is dominated by an old ksar (fort), whose ruins are well preserved.  Escape the heat in Tlemcen  Tlemcen was an important imperial city from the 12th to the 16th century and stands in the wooded foothills of the Tellian Atlas. A pleasant retreat from the stifling heat of high summer, its sights include the Grand Mosque, the Mansourah Fortress and the Almohad ramparts.  Explore ancient Constantine  Situated in the east of Algeria, Constantine is a natural citadel lying across the River Rhumnel. Founded by the Carthaginians, who called it Cirta, it is the oldest continuously inhabited city in Algeria. Sights include the Ahmed Bey Palace (one of the most picturesque in the Maghreb) and the Djamma el-Kebir Mosque.  Find the ‘golden key of the desert’  In the depths of the Sahara Desert, in southern Algeria, lies the ancient city of Ouargla, which is also known as 'the golden key to the desert'. This ochre-coloured town is well worth visiting for its lovely souks and lofty minarets, which overlook an expansive landscape.  Go dune skiing  When you see the size of some of the Saharan sand dunes, dune skiing suddenly makes sense. You can bring your own skis (no padding needed) – otherwise quite a few tour agencies offer this unforgettable experience.  Have Djemila all to yourself  This stunning Roman city near to the city of Sétif is incredibly well preserved but you may well find yourself the only person visiting when you get there. In a stunning setting, surrounded by verdant hills and pine forests, you'll discover huge temples, a formally laid out forum and a superb amphitheatre.  Hike around the Tassili N'Ajjer  Tour the Tassili N'Ajjer, or 'Plateau of Chasms', a vast volcanic plateau crossed by massive gorges, formed by rivers that have long since dried up. The Tassili conceals a collection of unique rupestrian paintings (rock paintings), which go back at least as far as the neolithic age.  Hit the Turquoise Coast  Within easy reach of Algiers are some fine seaside resorts. One of the most famous is Zeralda, a beach town with a holiday vibe and replica nomad village. To the east of Algiers, the Turquoise Coast offers rocky coves and long beaches aplenty. And the Sidi Fredj peninsula has a marina, an open-air theatre and various watersports facilities.  Imbibe Algeirs’ cultural offerings  Algiers' Bardo Ethnographic Museum and the National Museum of Fine Arts are amongst the finest museums in North Africa. Here you'll find important artefacts and treasures from all eras such as the Roman, Carthaginian and Islamic periods.  Kick back in Tamanrasset  Picturesque Tamanrasset, situated at the heart of the Hoggar Mountains, is the unofficial capital of Algeria's Sahara region. Tourists often stay in 'Tam' (as it is sometimes called) and use it as a base for touring the mountains or hiking in the desert. It is also a popular winter holiday destination for Algerians and is regularly visited by the camel caravans of les hommes bleus (the blue-robed Touaregs), who are the ancient nomadic inhabitants of this region.  Sweat it out in the Sahara  The Sahara Desert is the most striking and also most forbidding feature of Algeria. The best way to enter is to cross the El Kautara Gorges to the south of Constantine. The sudden glimpse of the Sahara through the El Kautara Gorges is breath-taking. These gorges are said to separate the winter areas from the land of everlasting summer and are called Fouur Es Sahra ('the Sahara's mouth') by local inhabitants.  Tour the Sahara by camel  Nothing is quite as evocative of the Sahara's endless sand than the sight of a camel caravan traversing the dunes. Travel agencies in Tamanrasset can organise camel tours of the desert, which allow you to camp overnight in the sands – an unforgettable experience.  Traipse through the ruins of Tipasa  Within easy reach of Algiers, the fascinating ruined city of Tipaza has exceptional Roman, Punic and Christian ruins, and a Numidian mausoleum overlooking a beautiful stretch of the Mediterranean. It's also easy day-tripping distance from Algiers, making it the most accessible Roman ruins in the country.  Trek the Hoggar Mountains  An impressive, jagged range of peaks across Algeria's southern Sahara, the Hoggar Mountains reach as far as Libya and are surrounded by desert on all sides. The massif consists of a plateau made of volcanic rock and eroded cliffs and granite needles form fascinating shapes in pink, blue or black basalt.  Visit holy Beni-Isguen  The holy town of Beni-Isguen, a fortified city not far from Ghardaia, is a remarkable sight. Set in the Sahara Desert, behind great ramparts, the sprawl of mud brick houses forms a dense warren of narrow streets, and not much has changed since it was first built in the 14th century. Visitors must observe a strict set of rules before entering – dress codes are stringent, no photos are allowed and everyone must be accompanied by a guide.  Wake up in Assekrem  Camping overnight at this holy retreat with views in all directions to the spectacular surrounding mountains is a wonderful experience. But the unquestionable highlight is getting up just before dawn and ascending the hillside to watch the sun break over the beautiful peaks.",africa,,
zimbabwe,"After a difficult decade or so, stability is returning to Zimbabwe and pioneering tourists are gradually trickling back to the country. They are richly rewarded for their endeavours: with its abundance of natural wonders, welcoming locals, fascinating heritage and good climate, Zimbabwe is one of the most remarkable countries in Africa.    The jewel in its glistening crown is Victoria Falls. Straddling the border between Zimbabwe and neighbouring Zambia, this waterfall is officially the largest on the planet and hearing the roar of all that cascading water makes for an unforgettable experience.    As well as awe-inspiring natural spectacles, Zimbabwe offers some of the best wildlife in southern Africa. From the forested mountains of the Eastern Highlands to the sun-washed grasslands of Hwange National Park, the country is teeming with flora and fauna, including the Big 5 (elephant, rhino, leopard, buffalo and lion).      Roughly 11% of Zimbabwe's land has been set aside for parks and wildlife estates, but it can do big cities too. The two most populous are Harare and Bulawayo, which serve up an impressive selection of cultural attractions, hip bars and fine dining restaurants. Between these two urban hubs lie the astonishing late Iron Age stone ruins at Great Zimbabwe, which shoot down theories that sub-Saharan Africa had no great civilizations.    It’s not all smooth sailing, though. Whilst Zimbabwe’s fragile economy is slowly improving, there is still widespread poverty and the government lacks the resources to deal with the ravages of the HIV pandemic, which affects an estimated one in four people here. Corruption is rife too, and roadblocks manned by officials looking for any excuse to fleece you can hinder cross-country travel.    But for the most part Zimbabwe remains a peaceful place full of peaceful people, who desperately need tourism to help build a better future for this incredible corner of Africa.","Zimbabwe  Attractions in Zimbabwe  Enjoy the natural wonders of Nyanga National Park  Situated in the stunning mountain range that covers the eastern part of Zimbabwe, Nyanga National Park is an area of high grasslands, evergreen forests, waterfalls, cliffs and lovely lakeside cottages. Trout fishing is very popular and the trout hatchery is well worth a visit. For the twitchers, there is lots of birdlife to be seen on a hike.  Experience Zambezi National Park  Just a few kilometres from the town of Victoria Falls is the Zambezi National Park, a scenic reserve that remains surprisingly remote and is having a considerable resurgence after decades of poaching and neglect. The riverine sections are particularly picturesque and the wildlife more abundant.  A good spot for a canoeing safari.  Explore Bulawayo  Pretty Bulawayo, Zimbabwe's second city, is rich in historical associations and is the home of the National Museum. Nearby are the ancient Khami ruins, while to the south is the Rhodes Matopos National Park, notable for its exotic formations of huge granite boulders. Dams with excellent fishing, caves with rock paintings and Cecil Rhodes' grave also add to the town's popularity with tourists.  Gawk at Great Zimbabwe National Monument  A holiday in Zimbabwe would be incomplete without a visit to the Great Zimbabwe National Monument, the largest complex of ruins in Africa south of the Egyptian pyramids. These miraculous and expansive stone remains are what is left of a powerful city-state that flourished between the 13th and 15th centuries, trading in gold.  Go on a canoeing safari  Canoeing and boat safaris are popular alternatives to the traditional game drive in Zimbabwe. At Lake Kariba, boats can be hired for a day, week or longer. Canoeing safaris ranging from three to 10 days are especially popular between April and November along the Zambezi River past the Mana Pools flood plains.  Hang out in Harare  Zimbabwe's capital Harare is the country's commercial and industrial centre and also the usual starting point for most visits. It's a clean and sophisticated city, characterised by flowering trees, colourful parks and contemporary architecture. Local sights also include various museums, art galleries and craft markets. Due to its pleasant climate, Harare is known as the 'Sunshine City'.  Hike the Eastern Highlands  The string of mountains and the lush countryside in Zimbabwe's Eastern Highlands are particularly sought after by walkers and trekkers. Climbing Zimbabwe's highest mountain, Mount Nyangani, takes around one hour 30 minutes. The World's View offers incredible vistas across northern Zimbabwe. From here, a steep footpath leads to the road to Nyanga village with its English gardens, village common and church.  Kick back on Lake Kariba  Situated in the northwest of the country on the Zambian border, Lake Kariba is the world's largest manmade dam. Both the game and the stellar sunsets can be viewed from the comfort of various waterfront lodges, or from well-appointed cruise vessels and self-contained houseboats.  Map Zimbabwe’s history at Matobo National Park  Located close to Bulawayo, Zimbabwe's second biggest city, Matobo National Park is noted for its spectacular granite rock formations and its wealth of ancient rock paintings. Cecil Rhodes' tomb can be visited at Malindidzimu (View of the World). The Nswatugi and Pomongwe caves are also worth visiting.  Marvel at the Victoria Falls  'Discovered' by the famous British explorer Dr David Livingstone, Victoria Falls, which form part of the border between Zimbabwe and Zambia, are one of Africa's best-known natural wonders and one of the world's most impressive waterfalls. The town of the same name is worth a visit too, and is a good place to book one of the many activities available in and around the falls.  See the natural beauty of Mana Pools National Park  Mana Pools National Park is one of Zimbabwe's most beautiful national parks, occupying 2,196 sq km (848 sq miles) of forest along the banks of the Zambezi River. Four of the 'Big Five' are present. Game-viewing on foot is allowed. The birdlife along the river is prolific. The park is also a great spot for fishing.  Spot the Big Five in Hwange National Park  Hwange is one of Zimbabwe's largest parks, covering 14,620 sq km (5,644 sq miles) of pristine bushveld. It's also one of the most diverse, with an astonishing array of wildlife. It's considered one of the last of the great elephant sanctuaries in Africa, with over 40,000 inside the park, and was the home of the late, great Cecil the Lion.",africa,,
north macedonia,,"North Macedonia (FYR Macedonia)  Attractions in North Macedonia (FYR Macedonia)  Be sure not to miss Bitola's Byzantine ruins  Surrounded by the hills and forest of Pelister National Park, pretty Bitola is the second-largest town in North Macedonia (FYR Macedonia). Located 18km (11 miles) from the Greek border, it was an important centre of Ottoman rule. Nearby, the ruins of the ancient it of Heraclea Lyncestis are well-preserved. Walk the remains of its Byzantine basilica with excellent mosaics.  Catch the cable car to one of the world's biggest crosses  Standing proudly atop Vodno Mountain, the Millennium Cross was erected to celebrate 2,000 years of Christianity in Macedonia. At 66m-high (217ft), the cross is one of the largest in the world and can be seen from Skopje city centre. Visitors can hike or take the Ropewalk cable car to the monument.  Discover the delights of Ohrid, the former capital  With its lakeside location, Ohrid is possibly the most attractive town in the FYR Macedonia. The site of the first Slav university, it was the Macedonian capital under leader Tsar Samuil. From his reign between 977 and 997 AD, the fortress walls survive and now provide a venue for summer concerts. Worthy of attention too are the number of ancient churches, particularly the cathedral of St Sophia.  Explore North Macedonia’s (FYR Macedonia’s) mosques and monasteries  North Macedonia (FYR Macedonia) boasts many mosques dating from the Ottoman period, but among the best is the 15th-century Mustafa Pasha Mosque in Skopje’s Old Bazaar. Just outside the capital, the Nerezi Monastery and its 12th-century Church of St Panteleimon will also delight with its neat domes and magnificent Byzantine frescoes.  Explore the new and old in Skopje  Much of Macedonia's capital, Skopje, is new following an earthquake in 1963. This includes several new statues and the Memorial House of Mother Teresa, which were erected in 2014 as a government drive to make the city more classical. There is plenty of (actual) history in the Old Bazaar area and the attractive quarter is full of charming Ottoman touches.  Make for the Museum of Contemporary Art  Founded following the earthquake in 1963, the Museum of Contemporary Art houses one of the finest collections of art in the country. Perched above the city, the building is an excellent example of late modernism architecture. Works by Pablo Picasso, Hans Hartung and Robert Jacobsen give the light-drenched exhibition space an international feel.  See Skopje's stone landmarks  Skopje's Stone Bridge is a city landmark and even features on its coat of arms. Crossing the Vardar River, the bridge was originally built by the Romans and connects Macedonia Square with the Old Town. Kale Fortress is an imposing 6th-century castle overlooking the river. Stroll up to its ramparts for exceptional views and see various archaeological finds inside.  See the sunken church of Mavrovo Lake  Southwest of Skopje is Mavrovo National Park. A vast 780 sq km (300 sq miles) region of deep canyons, snowy peaks and dense forest, it is ideal for hiking. Walk to Mavrovo Lake, it freezes during winter but during summer offers great boating and swimming opportunities. In its centre sits a half-submerged church.  Take in Skopje’s Old Town sights  Visit the Church of the Holy Saviour in Skopje's Old Town. Unassuming from the outside, its interior contains an intricately carved iconostasis. Nearby, two former caravanserais (roadside inns), the 15th century Suli An and 16-century Kursumli An, retain their wonderful archways, whilst the distinctive domed Daut Pasha Baths now houses an art gallery.  Unearth history at the National Archaeological Museum  The National Archaeological Museum (as the vast exterior columns attest) was borne out of the government's drive to make Skopje appear more classical. With artefacts dating back to the Neolithic period, the vast museum is worthy of an afternoon's exploration. The exhibitions are overwhelming in places, so a guided tour is recommended.",europe,,
isle of man,"As quirky destinations go, you’d be hard-pressed to beat the Isle of Man. Its mere existence is even a bit odd. Though officially part of the British Isles, the island is a self-governing kingdom that belongs to neither the United Kingdom nor European Union. Confused? You should be.      Things get stranger still, when you arrive on the island and find you’ve travelled back in time – this is a place where it is possible to get a steam train to the airport.      Suffice to say the island’s antiquity adds to the charm of this destination, which is also home to some spectacular scenery: lush valleys, rugged shores and fine sandy beaches abound, making it an adventure playground for outdoor enthusiasts.      Measuring 53km (33 miles) long and 21km (13 miles) wide, the Isle of Man floats in the middle of the Irish Sea, just off the Lancashire coastline. Killer whales, humpbacks, basking sharks, dolphins, seals and myriad bird species can be spotted in the surrounding waters, which are ripe for scuba diving.      The island’s main draw, however, is the notoriously dangerous TT motorcycle race, which takes place annually. Too fast for you? Then hit one of the many hiking and mountain biking trails, which crisscross the island. Or delve into the island’s curious history by exploring the prehistoric tombs, elaborate Celtic crosses and Iron Age hilltop forts, which are scattered across the wild landscape.      Beneath the time-warp surface, present-day Isle of Man has a contemporary edge. It’s still heavily associated with the finance industry, yet film-making and tourism are increasingly important as people start to discover the island's quiet natural beauty and rich heritage.      All things considered, the Isle of Man is a curious destination and perhaps the best-kept secret in the British Isles.","Isle of Man  Attractions in Isle of Man  Castle Rushen  In the centre of the Island's former capital Castletown, find this wonderfully preserved 13th century castle. Clamber up the spiral staircase, browse ancient tapestries, and explore all that lies within these ancient limestone walls. From the flag tower you can get especially good views of the coast and town below.  Climb Snaefell  Reaching 621m (2,036 ft) at its peak, Snaefell is an attractive proposition for walkers. There's a simple 1.5hr walk to the top or some trickier routes across more rugged and boggier ground. Alternatively you can cheat and catch the electric tram from Laxey. From the summit you can see all of the island and the bodies of water surrounding it; the local claim is that you can see seven surrounding kingdoms: Mann, Scotland, Ireland, Wales, England, Neptune and Heaven although the last two are more debatable, even if you get clear weather.  Discover Manx stone crosses  All across the island you'll discover fascinating sixth century crosses that represent grave markers and memorial stones; there are more than 200 to see. The earliest examples show Celtic styles using complicated interlacing and inscriptions whilst later, Norse sculptors used pagan images and mythology to decorate their stones.  Discover the Manx Glens  There are 17 glens all over the island, each with a distinct character. Many lead to the sea or to secret beaches. Explore them on foot to get a feel for some of the Isle of Man's hidden corners. Ballaglass is carpeted in bluebells during the spring; Groudle has a small railway running through it; Glen Maye is full of verdant vegetation and has a magnificent waterfall although Dhoon Glen, one of the steepest, hides the island's highest waterfall.  Douglas  Home to around a third of the island's population, Douglas is the capital of the Isle of Man and the centre of commerce. In its heyday during the mid-19th century the town was a favourite with Victorian visitors. Less popular and less pretty now, it still has a faded air of elegance, especially along the promenade. It's also home to many of the island's best hotels and restaurants.  Go mountain biking  With its varied terrain, quiet country lanes and challenging off-road, the Isle of Man is one of the best places in Britain for mountain biking. There are six designated off-road trails around the island, each of varying difficulty.  Lady Isabella Laxey Wheel  Built in 1854 to pump water from a mine, this giant wheel measures 22m (72.1ft) across and draws up to 1140L of water per minute from 550m (1,804ft) below the surface. Well-maintained and visually impressive, this is the largest wheel in the world of its kind. It is named after the wife of the then lieutenant-governor.  Music festivals  The Manx National Festival, Yn Chruinnaght (www.ynchruinnaght.com) is a celebration of Manx culture and its relationship with what it calls the other 'five Celtic countries', namely Scotland, Ireland, Wales, Cornwall and Brittany (!), usually held in the middle of July. Expect crafts, dance and music. Also check out Shennaghys Jiu (www.shennaghys.org) in April for ceilidhs and concerts.  Peel Castle  This Viking relic stands proudly atop St Patrick's Isle and is connected to Peel by a causeway. It is open to visitors in the summer months. The ruins of the castle are surrounded by emerald grounds, and look out towards the water; stroll here at dusk for particularly spectacular sunsets. Keep a look out for basking sharks and seals along the breakwaters as well.  Ride the rails  The Isle of Man is known for its narrow-gauge railways, but even those not sporting an anorak and carrying a notebook will enjoy a scenic ride on the variety of railways that trundle around the island. Snaefell Mountain Railway climbs to the summit of Man's highest peak.  Sample some seafood  There's plenty of fishing off the coast of the Isle of Man and you can enjoy great fresh seafood straight off the boats, often cooked over a hot grill or served simply. Chomp on one of Man's famous kippers (smoked herring), to which Moore's Traditional Museum in Peel is dedicated. So they must be good.  See a Manx ghost  Mythology is an important part of Manx culture and ghosts, of course, form a major part of this. Across the main settlements of Ramsey, Douglas, Peel and Castletown, local guides will take you on a chilling journey around the island's most haunted spots to hear about the White Lady of Castle Rushen and the Black Dog of Peel Castle.  The House of Manannan  Based in the City of Peel, the House of Manannan examines the seafaring heritage of Celtic, Viking and modern day islanders. Using multimedia displays, the guide for the tour is Manannan, the island's mythological sea god shape-shifter.  The Manx Museum  Variously a Norse stronghold, Scottish outpost and English protectorate, the history of long and complex, but the Manx Museum in Douglas, where interactive displays explain the Isle of Man's background background and take visitors up to the present, detailing even the latest TT winners.  The Sound and the Calf of Man  A small islet off Creyneash, in the southwest of the island, the Calf of Man is a rugged, picturesque spot. It is a bird sanctuary and home to a variety of seabird colonies. Seals, dolphins and basking sharks can often be seen in the Sound too. You can cruise around the Calf from Port Erin with Calf Island Cruises and can also stay on the island in the warden's farmhouse with prior permission during summer. Drop into the Sound Visitor Centre in Port St Mary to learn about the ships that sank in the area and the subsequent wrecks that divers now explore.  Walking  The whole island has tracks allowing you to explore on foot and the Isle of Man is often described as having some of the best walking in Britain. The Millennium Way runs the length of the country amidst spectacular scenery and the Road of the Gull (Raad ny Foillan) is a 153km (95 mile) circuit of the island; fairly tough, it meanders all around the coast, over cliffs, through glens and down steep gorges; it typically takes five days to complete. The best sections include Bradda Head, where a stone tower has panoramic views over Port Erin, and Maughold Head, which is home to puffins. Tynwald National Park and Arboretum offers a more relaxed walk.  Watch the races  The most famous event on the Isle of Man are the TT Races (www.iomtt.com). The series of motorbike races, is one of the most important meetings in the world. The riders hurl along the closed roads at cheek-wobbling speeds, and has its fair share of spills, especially on 'Mad Sunday' when anyone can ride the mountain section.  Whale watching  Basking sharks and dolphins love the waters around the Isle of Man and can frequently be seen, often within one kilometre of the coast. The best time to see them is from mid-May to mid-August. Find out how many have been seen at   www.manxbaskingsharkwatch.com.",europe,united kingdom,
uruguay,"A peaceful, laidback destination with a long history of liberalism (Uruguay was the first country to fully legalize marijuana) this pint-sized nation finds itself squeezed between Brazil and Argentina, and is often overshadowed by its heavyweight neighbours. However, as Uruguay has come to appreciate its subtle charms and small-scale attractions, so too have travellers.      Veer off the Gringo Trail and into Uruguay, and you will be pleasantly surprised. Considering its size, the country boasts an astonishing variety of diversions. Its windswept Atlantic coastline features dunes, lagoons and perfect surf; visitors can hop between hip beach resorts, clustered around the chic Punta del Este, abscond to sleepy fishing villages or take wildlife excursions to see penguins, sea lions and whales. The interior is equally rewarding. Journey up the Rio de la Plata and discover charming colonial towns, thermal springs and working haciendas, which offer an authentic taste of traditional gaucho life.      The jewel in Uruguay’s crown, though, is the capital, Montevideo. Punching well above its weight culturally and economically, this buzzing metropolis is classified as a Beta World City and is considered the most gay-friendly city in Latin America. Montevideo is a handsome place of stunning architecture, breezy promenades and sandy beaches. It’s also home to the world’s longest carnival, a heady six-week street party that puts other South American cities to shame.      Sleepy Colonia del Sacramento is another gem. Situated on the banks of the Rio de la Plata, opposite Buenos Aires, this amorous city offers enchanting cobbled streets, leafy plazas and 18th-century Portuguese architecture. It’s unflappably laidback, but for something even cooler head to Cabo Polonio, an off-grid eco-resort founded by hippies and fishermen, where the stresses of modern life ebb away and there’s time to appreciate nature and likeminded people.      All things considered, Uruguay should be treated like one of its famous beefsteaks; take your time over it, savour it and when you’re done, come back for more. You’ll never get your fill.","Uruguay  Attractions in Uruguay  Beef up on the Oxo cube  Not many people may know this but the humble Oxo cube was invented in Uruguay. Today, you can contemplate the international impact of this stock cube, which was manufactured here and prized by everyone from Edmund Hillary to WWI troops, by visiting the Museo de la Revolución Industrial. This 19th-century meat processing plant-turned-museum is in Fray Bentos, where another gastronomic icon was born: corned beef.  Experience a Uruguayan football match  Wedged between two of the world's great footballing nations, Argentina and Brazil, Uruguayans are also passionate about the beautiful game. Attend a match and share in the uniquely South American carnival spirit on the terraces. Serious fans can also visit the Museo del Fútbol in the Estadio Centenario, the Montevideo stadium where Uruguay's national team won the first World Cup in 1930.  Have a soak in Salto’s hot springs  Northwest Uruguay is home to one of the world's most important underground aquifers, producing warm medicinal springs. Near the town of Salto are some wonderful spas where you can wash off the Pampas dust, including the remote and tranquil Termas de Arapey, the family-friendly Termas de Daymán, or the Termas de San Nicanor.  Hit Montevideo’s markets  Savour the racks of roasting meat and vegetables at Montevideo's Mercado del Puerto, a popular lunch spot in an old covered market by the waterfront, and get lost in a sea of street vendors at Montevideo's Tristán Narvaja market, just east of downtown. Every Sunday several city blocks are filled with stalls selling everything from antiques to jewellery to live birds.  Join Montevideo’s Carnival frenzy  Get swept up by the joyous dancing and drumming in the streets every February during Montevideo's exuberant Afro-Uruguayan Carnival. Although celebrated throughout the country, the capital hosts the best carnival festivities, with its roots in the Candomble beliefs of the African slaves brought here by the Spanish. The main events take place over two days before Mardi Gras, but many locals take the whole week to join in the fun.  Meander around Montevideo, Uruguay’s stylish capital  Enjoy the eclectic mix of colonial, European and modern influences in Uruguay's capital. Walk around the palm-shaded plazas of the Ciudad Vieja (Old Town), see the fascinating Gaucho Museum, the Carnival Museum and cool off in appealing beach suburbs such as Playa Carrasco, east of town.  Party with the jet set of Punta del Este  Spend the day parasailing, windsurfing, waterskiing, sport fishing or lounging on the long sandy beaches at Punta del Este, one of South America's most exclusive resorts. And when the sun goes down, put on your party togs and shimmy with the rich and famous at Punta's chic nightclubs, in Punta Ballena and La Barra.  Relive the border battles at Santa Teresa and San Miguel  Get a feel for the historic conflict between Spanish and Portuguese forces at the fortresses of Santa Teresa and San Miguel near the northeastern town of Chuy close to the Brazilian border. Built in the 18th century, today the fortresses have been completely restored and are open to visitors, offering an impressive experience of the region's colonial past.  Saddle up with the gauchos on an Estancia  Go for a horse ride, stargaze by the barbecue and get a taste of gaucho life at one of Uruguay's tourist estancias, dozens of which are dotted all over the vast pampas. Two of the best are San Pedro de Timote and La Sirena, or if you fancy trying an authentic experience some ranches offer working stays, such as the Estancia El Silencio.  Sample Uruguay’s Swiss cheeses  Low-lying, temperate Uruguay may hardly be comparable to the Alps, but thousands of visitors each year seek out the fine dairy products in the 19th-century Swiss settlement of Nueva Helvecia (formerly Colonia Suiza: Swiss Colony), west of the capital. The town also features Swiss-style hotels and restaurants, which are popular with locals and homesick Europeans alike.  See a tango at Teatro Solís  Attend a concert, play, or tango performance at Montevideo's renovated 19th-century opera house, Teatro Solís; or enjoy live music and dance at one of the city's dozens of other nightspots, with many clustered along Ciudad Vieja's pedestrianised areas, as well as in Punta Carretas and Pocitos.  Stay in Casapueblo, a ‘liveable sculpture’  Carlos Paéz Vilaró was one of Uruguay's foremost abstract artists and you can visit one of his most famous works: the extravagantly whimsical art studio, Casapueblo. This nine-story whitewashed 'liveable sculpture' cascades down the cliffs of Punta Ballena, near Punta del Este. The remarkable complex now also includes a gallery, museum, cafe and a hotel.  Stroll along the Rambla  For an unforgettable slice of Montevideo life, take a weekend stroll along the Rambla (riverfront promenade), where you'll find joggers, windsurfers and throngs of sociable locals cradling thermoses of mate (herb tea) as they chat with friends on the beach. Go at dusk to see a stunning sunset over the Rio del Plata.

Punta del Diablo is a quiet fishing village for most of the year, but every summer it fills up with diehard surfers and other adventurers kept busy with dune surfing, horseback riding and jeep forest safaris.  Visit Colonia del Sacramento, Uruguay’s historic treasure  Colonia del Sacramento's cobblestoned streets and sycamore-shaded plazas are perfect for whiling away a lazy day. Enter this ancient treasure via the reconstructed city gate, the Portón de Campo, and spend the day browsing art galleries, dining in cosy restaurants and kicking back in cafes. Come nightfall, watch sunset over the Río de la Plata.  Watch the wildlife  Uruguay's vast empty landscapes are a nature-lover's paradise. Trek over sand dunes to see the lighthouse and abundant marine life at Cabo Polonio on the Atlantic coast. Observe the rich array of bird life at one of eastern Uruguay's coastal lagoons, including Laguna de Rocha near La Paloma, Laguna de Castillos near Barra de Valizas, and Laguna Negra near Punta del Diablo.",south america,,

british overseas territories,"There are 14 British Overseas Territories in all. The last vestiges of the British Empire they are: Bermuda, Gibraltar, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, the Falkland Islands, Turks and Caicos Islands, Anguilla, British Indian Ocean Territory, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, British Antarctic Territory, St Helena and its dependencies (Ascension and Tristan da Cunha), Montserrat, the Pitcairn Group of Islands, and the Sovereign Base Areas on Cyprus.      These territories are under the sovereignty and formal control of the UK but are not an actual part of the UK. Most British Overseas Territories are self-governing but rely on the UK in crucial matters of foreign policy etc. Since they are separate jurisdictions, there is no British Overseas Territories' representation in the British parliament. The UK exerts its formal control through a governor of each territory, appointed by the British Monarch.      In addition to the 14 British Overseas Territories, there are two British Crown Dependencies, which include the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands, which are dependencies of the British Crown whilst exercising considerable self-government in domestic affairs.      Many British aspects are apparent in the crown dependencies, such as the UK telephone numbering plan or a BBC presence, although this is not always the case. Acts of the British parliament rarely – but occasionally – apply to the crown dependencies.      The following territories and dependencies have their own sections: Anguilla, Bermuda, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Falkland Islands, Gibraltar, Montserrat, Turks & Caicos Islands, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands.",British Overseas Territories  Attractions in British Overseas Territories,europe,united kingdom,

White sand and surf lure sun worshipers and adrenaline junkies to the state’s 480km (300 miles) of barrier island beaches; surfers paddle out to ride the renowned swell at Cape Hatteras; hang-gliders launch off dunes the size of small mountains at Jockey’s Ridge; and wild horses roam the beach at Corolla in the Outer Banks.      If flopping on the sand doesn’t do it for you, try North Carolina’s historic attractions. Think Europe has the stately home market tied up? Think again.

Come autumn, convoys of sightseers cruise the Blue Ridge Parkway, a 406km (252-mile) scenic drive through mountains and dense forests, to snap the state’s kaleidoscopic colours.       But North Carolina’s pièce de résistance is its world-class ice climbing. While you can stand and gaze at plummeting waterfalls in summer, hacking your way up them with crampons and an ice axe is a sure-fire way to crank up the adrenaline. Starshine, a 60m (200ft) route on Whitesides Mountain, is considered one of the gnarliest.      Looking for some city action?

federated states of micronesia,"Scattered across the Pacific Ocean, the Federated States of Micronesia is the epitome of paradise – with its powdery shores, crystalline waters and colourful coral reefs – but its lack of connectivity and relative obscurity means few travellers actually make it here.      Comprised of some 607 islands, this archipelago is not the easiest place to get to, but it certainly rewards those who do make the journey. In islands like Chuuk, visitors will find vast lagoons of monumental beauty, filled with shipwrecks, kaleidoscopic corals and sandy beaches. The islands are a dream for divers, and many argue that the area’s diving and snorkelling ranks among the best in the world.      It’s not all about natural beauty, though. The Micronesians themselves combine a profusion of languages, customs and folklore, which are captivating to witness. The archipelago is defiantly archaic too, which is wholly refreshing: on the island of Yap, islanders still trade using an ancient stone currency. Some Micronesians can also be glimpsed wearing traditional garments and throughout the nation you are likely to stumble across snatches of unique island music and witness zesty, time-honoured dances.      Though a sovereign nation now, the archipelago has been dragged from pillar to post by various colonial powers. The Portuguese, Spanish, Germans and Japanese have all laid claim to the territory, followed by the USA, which took over the administration the nation in 1947. However, in 1986, the Federated States signed a Compact of Free Association with the USA, allowing for independence with US defence support.      The islands suffer from remoteness and lack of industry and infrastructure. There is development potential, but as yet Micronesia remains dependent on US aid. Tourism is one industry that could potentially boost the island's fiscal situation. However, even if tourism does take off, with 607 islands to speak of, finding some deserted shores to relax on shouldn't be too hard.","Federated States Of Micronesia  Attractions in Federated States Of Micronesia  Bathe beneath beautiful waterfalls  Explore Pohnpei's magnificent waterfalls and bathe in the plunge pools below. Two of the most beautiful are Kepirohi and Sahwartik. A 20-minute ride out of Kolonia is the Nanpil River and a large natural pool. On the same river are the spectacular Liduduhniap Twin Waterfalls.  Dive down to a whole fleet of shipwrecks  Dive at the unspoiled Ant Atoll, Pakin Atoll and Black Coral in Pohmpei State. The state of Chuuk contains famous Truk Lagoon, where a whole Japanese fleet was sunk during WWII. More than 50 wrecks can be seen, some in shallower waters suitable for snorkelers. The island of Yap sees schools of manta rays year round.  Hike to the summit of Sokehs Mountain  Tackle the moderately difficult hike up Sokehs Mountain, which offers breath-taking views of Sokehs rock and Kolonia harbour. As well as tropical vegetation and an abundance of birdlife, the trek along Japanese Road will reveal anti-aircraft guns, the remains of a power station and a searchlight platform atop the summit.  See mythical creatures at Pwudoi Sanctury  Eels play a prominent part in Pohnpei's mythological past, portrayed as both benevolent and as terrifying monsters. Visitors can make their own minds about them at the Pwudoi Sanctuary. See the large eels up close in the sanctuary's eel pool and watch the locals to handle the slippery creatures.  Settle down in your own shoreline paradise  When in paradise you have to hit the beach. Crowd-free bays with powder white sands and warm shimmering crystal seas are the norm in the Federated States of Micronia but the tree-hemmed shores around Kosrae stand out and the charming shores of Yap's Chamorro Bay should not be missed.  Stay the night at Black Coral Island  Spend a night on Black Coral Island. Situated in the lagoon behind Pohnpei's barrier reef, this small, sandy islet is untouched by the modern hand. Simple thatched huts offer shelter for those that chose to stay overnight, the barrier reef makes for fantastic snorkelling and sharp eyes will hope to spot an eagle ray.  Strike out with a baseball game  Watch islanders dabble in a game of baseball, which is an archipelago-wide passion. The sport became popular after US marines became based in Guam. There is a stadium in the centre of Yap, while baseball fields in Tofol and Guam boast a national team. Volleyball is also popular among islanders.  Tour the states' historical sites  See the states' most important historical sites: the pretty German-built Catholic Bell Tower in Pohnpei; the Japanese Wartime Communication Centre at Xavier High School in Chuuk; and the ancient ruins of Insaru in Kosrae. Dating back to 1,300 AD, the ballast blocks were once an important city.  Visit the Venice of Micronesia, Nan Madol  Located off the eastern shore of Pohnpei, Nan Madol is considered an ancient feat of engineering. The ruins are atop artificial islands intercut by a series of canals and have been set in place without pulleys, levers or other such modern techniques. Explore the remains of what were once bathhouses, temples and burial sites.  Visit the remains of Micronesia's colonial past  Today, the Spanish Wall acts as the outer boundary to a baseball pitch but they were originally the ramparts of the Fort Alphonso XII erected following a local uprising. A nod to the island's Spanish colonisation of the late 19th-century, the wall is one of only a few colonial sites that remain.",oceania,pacific islands of micronesia,
colombia,"Since emerging from decades of civil unrest, Colombia has established itself as one of the world’s top destinations. And rightly so: this exquisite South American nation is blessed with natural beauty – think high Andean peaks, Caribbean beaches, pristine Amazon jungle – not to mention mysterious archaeological sites, colonial treasures and thriving cities. It’s a joy to travel around.      At the heart of it all is Bogota, the pulsating capital. Once synonymous with drug cartels and gangs, the city has recast itself as one of South America’s trendiest destinations; a place of hip bars and street art, vibrant markets and colourful architecture. Sprawled across the Andean plateau, Bogota offers a fabulous mix of old and new; the cobbled streets of La Candelaria offer a stark contrast to the urban chic of Zona Rosa. But it works.      Elsewhere, Colombia’s colonial towns have been lovingly preserved, most notably the UNESCO-listed city of Cartagena. But don’t stop there. Other historic settlements also warrant a visit, amongst them the cities of Mompós, Villa de Leiva and Barichara. The mysterious “lost city” of Ciudad Perdida is also worthy of a detour, but you may leave with more questions than you arrived with.      The more you travel around Colombia, the more you marvel at its diversity. While the Caribbean and Pacific shores boast beautiful beaches, islands and coral reefs, the lofty Andes offer high-altitude plains, snow-capped mountains and limpid lakes. Then there are the eastern lowlands with their grassy wetlands and bountiful birdlife, not to mention the virgin forests of the Amazon.      Colombian culture is no less magical. Garcia Marquez’s land of magic realism is alive with festivals and music; the high-energy city of Cali is recognized as the salsa capital of Colombia, while bustling Barranquilla hosts a dazzling carnival to rival Rio’s. To cap it all off, visitors can expect a warm welcome from the country’s friendly inhabitants, who, after years in the wilderness, can finally show their true colours. And what a picture they paint.","Colombia  Attractions in Colombia  Climb Nevado del Ruiz  Climb the snow-capped Nevado del Ruiz: the 5,400m (17,717ft) peak is one of five permanently white-tipped volcanoes in Los Nevados National Park in the coffee region. Volcanic eruptions and earthquakes are regular occurrences here, though hikers enjoy the benefits of hot springs bubbling from the mountainsides. Guided treks are available from Manizales, one of the main hubs for visitors.  Cycle around car-free Bogotá  Cycle or skate along car-free roads in central Bogotá on Sundays and holidays from 0700 to 1400, when 121km (75 miles) of the capital's streets are transformed into ciclovías (cycleways). Cycling-mad Colombia also has many ideal countryside routes, where mountain-biking and touring groups operate, including the temperate hillsides of the Zona Cafetera.  Delve into the Salt Cathedral of Zipaquirá  The colonial city of Zipaquirá is home to one of Colombia's most popular attractions: a cathedral made of sale. Inaugurated in 1954, the underground church was hewn out of the mountain, deep within a salt mine near the city. Stalactites and specks of salt mingle with crosses and chapels to create a glowing spiritual atmosphere.  Drift through the Amazon  Take a jungle tour into the Amazon basin, which covers almost one-third of Colombia's territory. Boat trips depart from Leticia, in the Amazonas region to the nearby Amacayu National Park. Tours often include visits to indigenous tribes, sleeping in hammocks slung in straw-roofed malocas. The park is prone to closure following flooding, so check the latest information before departure.  Explore the jungle and beaches of Tayrona National Park  With its stunning Caribbean location, the Tayrona National Park, close to Santa Marta, is one of the country's most popular parks. Spilling down from the northern slopes of the Sierra Nevada, it boasts coral reefs, sheltered bays, beautiful beaches, mangroves and wildlife-rich jungle. Get back to nature but don't forget to pack your mosquito repellent.  Get wet and wild  Colombia offers a host of adventures for watersports lovers. Dive into the species-rich tropical waters of the UNESCO Seaflower Biosphere Reserve around San Andrés and Providencia. Other diving hotspots include the Islas del Rosario and Tayrona National Park. Raft the rapids on the Rio Negro in Cundinamarca and Fonce or kayak through the Chicamocha canyon in Santander.  Head for the dizzying heights of Bogotá  Perched high in the Andes, the Colombian capital has an attractive mix of swish, modern neighbourhoods and windy streets overlooked by a mountainous vantage point (take the cable car up for great sunset views). Historical landmarks include the Capitolio Nacional and the cathedral on the main square, Plaza Bolivar. The star attraction, however, is the magnificent Gold Museum; its collection of pre-Columbian treasures is probably the finest in South America.  Look for pirate treasure in the Caribbean  Fly to the tropical islands of San Andrés and its smaller sibling Providencia, two of Colombia's most idyllic retreats, off the Caribbean coast. San Andrés was once the headquarters of the English pirate Captain Henry Morgan, with an offshore underwater cave reputed to be the site of his buried loot, and a nearby museum dedicated to local pirate lore.  Marvel at Botero’s artwork in Bogotá  One of Latin America's most famous modern artists is Colombian Fernando Botero and visitors can wander among some of his characteristically voluptuous sculptures in the Plaza Botero, found in Bogotá's La Candelaria. Around 120 of his paintings, as well as an impressive collection of Impressionist and modern art, are on display at the Museo Botero, also in La Candelaria.  Party at Carnival in Barranquilla  Once a year, the industrial port of Barranquilla is transformed by one of the world's biggest carnivals, second in size only to Rio de Janeiro's event, and attracting visitors from around the globe. The main parades take place on the four days preceding Ash Wednesday, when the city streets are filled with thousands of costumed dancers, gyrating to the lively Caribbean rhythms.  Pop down to Popayán  A great town to visit en route to the south, Popayán is a vision of beautifully restored colonial architecture. Wander around the stunning streets and visit the beautiful churches, in particular Belén, which is perched on a hilltop and provides lovely views. Easter week processions here are particularly impressive and nearby are the pre-Columbian tombs in Tierradentro National Park.  Puzzle over San Agustín’s mysterious statues  Weave your way around more than 500 mysterious pre-Columbian stone statues and tombs in one of South America's most fascinating archaeological sites, San Agustín, in the southern Cordilera Central. Thought to date back some 3,000 years, this is the largest group of religious monuments and megalithic sculptures on the continent, relating to one of the earliest Andean settlements.  Shake your hips in Cali  Colombia's capital of salsa, the southern city of Cali is the place to go for all-night hip swinging. Dress to impress in the salsa clubs, many of which are found in the Barrio Juanchito, which gets going at 0200 and doesn't stop until 0600. During the day explore San Antonio, the historical centre, or visit one of the highly rated museums.  Soak up the colonial charms of Cartagena  One of South America's prettiest colonial towns, charming Cartagena brims with history and is more than a little easy on the eye. The former home of author, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, visitors can take literary tours of the city, explore cobbled streets and sip coffee beneath beautiful blooms of bougainvillea. Once you've had your culture fix, take a trip to nearby coral islands, which abound with beaches, labyrinthine mangrove forests and colourful coral reefs.  Take a hike to the Ciudad Perdida  Climb high into the jungle-covered Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta to the archaeological ruins of the Ciudad Perdida ('Lost City'), discovered in 1976. This six-day trek is not for the faint-hearted, but is one of Colombia's most rewarding adventures.  Tour the Zona Cafetera (Coffee Zone)  Colombia is famous for its coffee, and you can take a trip to this region of gently rolling hillsides, visiting the coffee haciendas and hiking, cycling or horseback riding through the countryside, trying different coffees along the way. The triangle is made up of Quindío, Caldas and Risaralda departments, with plenty of towns in the area in which to stay.  Travel back in time to Santa Cruz de Mompox  Known simply as Mompox, this tiny colonial gem is off the main tourist path due to its comparative inaccessibility, but it's worth the trip by bus and boat. With its well-preserved architecture, the town has a sleepy, friendly feel about it. Simon Bolivar was one of its most famous residents, and Gabriel Garcia Márquez based his classic, One Hundred Years of Solitude, on the town.  Visit vibrant Medellín  The second largest city in Colombia, Medellín is modern and vibrant, having shaken off its association with violent drug cartels. Today, the pleasantly warm 'City of Eternal Spring' has a lively young community of university students, with a lot of time for the arts. Visit the museums and parks, learn to tango and embrace the serious nightlife on offer. The annual Festival of Flowers in August is superb.",south america,,
ivory coast,"Ivory Coast is a country of extremes; a land of pulsating metropolises and pristine rainforests, vast churches and verdant hills, fancy restaurants and sprawling street stalls. Its reputation might be sullied by the recent civil war, but most areas are now stable and ripe for discovery.      Coastal Abidjan is the unofficial capital and the entry point for most travellers. The French influence is clear to see here, not least in the food, which is served in some bistros with the kind of pomp you might expect in downtown Paris. These eateries are a stark contrast to the traditional maquis restaurants, which sprawl out onto the city’s bustling streets. Pull up a plastic pew, order some food and share a meal with locals.      Dubbed the “Manhattan of Africa” the gleaming skyscrapers and manicured gardens of The Plateau give downtown Abidjan a decidedly modern feel. This commercial district is also home to St Paul’s Cathedral, which boasts impressive stained glass windows and great views across the city.      While most of the action takes place in Abidjan, Yamoussoukro is the official capital. It is notable for its massive mosque and even bigger Basilica of Our Lady of Peace, which is the largest church in the world. Football is also a religion here and watching The Elephants, the national football team, offers a memorable day out for sports fans.      Ivory Coast’s true beauty really shines through when you get out of the cities. There are no fewer than eight national parks in the country, including Comoé, the largest protected area in West Africa, which boasts the most biodiverse savannah in the world. Expect to see anything from lions and leopards to aardvarks and African elephants. The pygmy hippos of Tai National Park are also a big draw for naturalists, while the beautiful beaches around San Pedro,Assine and Grand Bassam attract bathers of all stripes.      Sure, Ivory Coast has had its problems, but a sanguine spirit is binding this country together again and putting it back on the map.","Ivory Coast  Attractions in Ivory Coast  Be impressed by the capital, Yamoussoukro  Discover the city's lively market, the mosque and the palace of the president, not to mention the exquisite Cathédrale Notre-Dame-de-la-Paix. Fractionally smaller than St Peter's in Rome, it incorporates a greater area of stained glass than the total area of stained glass in France. Yamoussoukro was the birthplace of President Félix Houphouët-Boigny. The cathedral was paid for almost entirely out of his own pocket.  Escape to the beach  About 100km (60 miles) east of Abidjan is the beach resort of Assouinde. Also not too far from the city is Grand Bassam, whose sandy beaches make the place a favourite weekend retreat for the inhabitants of Abidjan. Note that in Abidjan and the surrounding coastal resorts, there is a dangerous deep current and swimmers should stay near the shore.  Go Fishing  There is good coastal and river fishing in Côte d'Ivoire. Red carp, barracuda, mullet and sole can all be caught from the shores of the lagoons. Sea trips can be organised through travel agencies to catch swordfish, bonito and marlin. Boats and instructors are available in Abidjan, where waterskiing and sailing are also available.  Marvel at the bright lights of Abidjan  The former capital and largest city, Abidjan, comes as a pleasant surprise to many visitors. The glistening downtown is a place of bright lights and lofty skyscrapers, while the more traditional Old Town, Treichville, is home to many bars, restaurants and nightclubs, plus the colourful central market. There is a very good museum, the Ifon Museum, as well as the National Museum containing historic artefacts, statues and ivory.  Spot African wildlife  The largest and oldest national park in Côte d'Ivoire is Comoë National Park, in the northeast, where lions, waterbucks, hippos and other animals can be seen frolicking in their natural habitat. The Abokouamekro Game Reserve is another great spot for wildlife watching and is one of the more accessible parks, about an hour outside Yamoussoukro. Most national parks in Côte d'Ivoire are largely inaccessible for visitors without their own vehicles.  Take a hike  The verdant hills surrounding Man, nicknamed the 'City of 18 Mountains', are a joy for hikers. As well as harbouring some of the last remaining rainforest in Côte d'Ivoire, these lofty ranges are also home to Mount Tonkoui, whose 1,223m (4,012ft) summit offers views over Liberia and Guinea. Guides are necessary for longer walks.  Tour the provinces  Take a trip around Côte d'Ivoire. Places worth visiting include Korhogo, the main city in the north, which is notable for its woodcarving and handicrafts. The former capital of Bingerville, with its idyllic, lagoon-side setting, and the town of Bouaké, also renowned for its crafts, are also worth a visit.  Walk to a waterfall  From Man you can visit La Cascade, a pretty waterfall that crashes into a bamboo forest, 5km (3 miles) from town. The falls are accessed via a paved pathway, which offers a pleasant walk through the forests. Hikers can expect to receive a warm welcome if they take a detour to the villages of Biankouma and Gouessesso.  Watch some stilt dancing  Dancers in Côte d'Ivoire perform incredible acrobatics on stilts as part of time-honoured ceremonial dances. Often performed at weddings, funerals or the arrival of an important person, these rituals are performed by children as young as seven. Visits to stilt dancing performances can be arranged from Man.",africa,,
thailand,"The attractions of Thailand are myriad – ruined cities, ancient monasteries, Buddhist monks, colourful hill tribes, floating markets, rave parties, dense rainforests, exotic wildlife, tropical islands, golden beaches and pristine coral reefs. Then there’s Bangkok, the most exuberant capital city in Southeast Asia, which would justify a trip to Thailand all by itself.      The Thai people are famously hospitable, and Thailand was one of the first corners of Southeast Asia to really open up to outsiders – helped by the 19th-century king of Siam Rama IV and his love of all things Western. It was Rama IV who launched Thailand on the path to modernisation, and also persuaded his people to swap chopsticks for knives and forks.      This travel smorgasbord has attracted everyone from backpackers to billionaires, and visitors can find any level of comfort they desire, from hippy hostels to five-star palaces. If anything, Thailand has become more upmarket as a destination since its backpacker heyday, with air-conditioning everywhere and almost every hotel offering Thai massages and spa treatments.      As well as relaxation – and what could be more relaxing than a massage on the beach? – Thailand is a place for adventure. The beaches and islands of the south call out to scuba divers, rock-climbers and water sports enthusiasts, while the dense jungles of the north are a natural playground for trekkers and wildlife spotters. Try bathing under a waterfall in an orchid-filled jungle clearing – you won't forget it.      Then there’s the cuisine – one of the world’s finest, and certainly one of the spiciest. From fine restaurants to street stalls and night markets, Thailand always seems to have a fork in its hand. Above all else, though, Thailand is a place to feel at ease – stroll along the sand, take tea with a monk, snorkel over a coral reef, and let the stresses of modern life slowly slip away.","Thailand  Attractions in Thailand  Cheer the winning fighter at kickboxing match  Muay thai (Thai kickboxing) is the national martial art, an ancient form of combat with spiritual overtones. Awesome bouts can be seen in most major cities, preceded by elaborate rituals and accompanied by Sarama, the rhythmic music played on drums, cymbals and the Thai oboe. If you fancy getting in the ring, there are training academies across the country that offers training to beginners and experienced fighters.  Dive into the jungle in a Thai National Park  Large areas of Thailand are given over to national parks, many in the jungle-covered highlands where the landscape is too tortuous for agriculture. Doi Inthanon National Park near Chiang Mai surrounds the nation’s highest peak, while Khao Sok National Park near Phanom preserves the largest area of virgin jungle in Thailand.  Drift around the islands of Phang Nga Bay  Covering 400 sq km (154 sq miles) Phang Nga Bay is one of the world's great scenic wonders. Rising surreally from the turquoise ocean, are hundreds of limestone islands and outcrops, home to rare wildlife and peppered with caves and grottoes. If it looks familiar, it’s probably because The Man with the Golden Gun was filmed here in 1974.  Find a perfect beach on Thai islands  Thailand’s islands offer some of Asia’s finest beaches. Take your pick from resort luxury on Ko Samui, backpacker vibes on Ko Chang, or a peaceful experience on Ko Lipe. In fact, pretty much every Thai island has a perfect beach to kick back on.  Get in touch with your spiritual side on a meditation course  There are retreats all over Thailand where you can get in touch with your spiritual side, from yoga resorts on tropical beaches to remote forest monasteries offering strict training in Buddhist meditation. If you are just curious about Buddhism, try chatting to the monks at Chiang Mai’s popular ‘monk chat’ sessions.  Get soaked for Songkran  The biggest party on the Thai calendar, Songkran marks the Thai New Year every April. After genteel visits to monasteries to shower Buddha images with water, locals grab hosepipes and water pistols and engage in running water fights in the streets of Bangkok and Chiang Mai. The atmosphere is incredible, and everyone – foreigners included – gets a soaking.  Go temple hopping in Chiang Mai  The temple-studded city of Chiang Mai is the capital of northern Thailand, and the homeland of the Lanna people, who were once an independent nation before unification with the Kingdom of Siam. Within the ruined medieval city walls are dozens of timeless wats (monasteries) with soaring, tiered rooftops adorned with golden carvings of nagas (sacred serpents).  Interact with elephants at Elephant Nature Park near Chiang Mai  Thailand’s Elephant Nature Park (+66 53 272 855; www.elephantnaturepark.org) focuses on gentle elephant interactions. Visitors can wander with herds of jumbos rescued from tourist shows and logging camps. Elephant Nature Camp is one of the best, and visitors feed the herd and participate in elephant bath time.  Learn the fine art of Thai cooking  Why stop at just tasting Thailand’s fabulously spicy cuisine? Across the country, local cooks have started cooking schools where you’ll learn to whip up the perfect green curry and pound your own curry pastes, usually after a visit to a local market to buy ingredients. Bangkok is Thailand’s undisputed cooking school capital.  Make the pilgrimage to Wat Phra That Doi Suthep in Chiang Mai  The gleaming golden spire of Wat Phra That Doi Suthep rises above the rooftops of Chiang Mai from the slopes of Doi Suthep, the city’s most sacred peak. The monastery was founded in the 14th century, after the location was selected by a wandering white elephant, and it remains a stunning example of Northern Thai architecture.  Marvel at the grandeur of the Grand Palace in Bangkok  Rising like a gilded shrine beside the Chao Phraya River, Bangkok's glittering Grand Palace is one of the wonders of Asia. In the grounds is the equally glittering Wat Phra Kaew, a temple covered in gold and mosaics. Also known as the Temple of the Emerald Buddha in English, houses in its most sacred sanctum the legendary Emerald Buddha, once enshrined in both Chiang Rai and Chiang Mai.  Measure up against Thailand’s biggest reclining Buddha  A stone’s throw from the Royal Palace, magnificent Wat Pho is the most important monastery in old Bangkok and the spiritual home of Thai massage. As well as chapels piled high with golden Buddha images, the monastery enshrines the largest reclining Buddha in Thailand, measuring 46m (151ft) from its gilded topknot to its mother of pearl-inlaid feet.  Ride the Chao Phraya Express  All day, the crowded ferry boats of the Chao Phraya Express cruise up and down the Chao Phraya river, offering gorgeous glimpses of the spires of the Grand Palace and the towering prangs (temple towers) of Wat Arun (www.watarun.net). As well as front row seats for life on the river, the boats are buffeted by cooling breezes.  Roam through the ruins of a vanished empire in Ayuthaya  The ruins of abandoned royal capitals are scattered across the central plains in Thailand, but the UNESCO-listed remains of the Ayutthaya Kingdom, the most important power in the country from 1351 to 1767, are perhaps the most atmospheric. Exploring the ruins by bicycle, you’ll still be struck by the grandeur of the crumbling monasteries and Buddha images on all sides.  Scale the limestone cliffs of Krabi  Krabi was a sleepy country town before rock climbers discovered the astonishing karst cliffs at Ao Nang and Rai Leh. Today, hundreds of bolted sport climbing routes ascend soaring limestone buttresses that rise dramatically above white sand beaches, and Krabi has become an essential stop on the backpacker circuit. Local climbing schools can show you the ropes.  Scuba dive the teeming reefs of southern Thailand  Thailand’s coral reefs are one of world’s best places to scuba dive, attracting everything from miniature shrimps to gigantic whale sharks. The southern coast is dotted with spectacular dive sites, some accessible from shore, others only open to divers on live-aboard cruises. Topping the list are the Surin Islands and Similan Islands, north and northwest of Phuket respectively.  Step into Thai history in the Bangkok National Museum  Bangkok National Museum (+66 2 224 1333; www.virtualmuseum.finearts.go.th) is the largest museum in Southeast Asia and houses some remarkable relics from Thai history, including the gold-encrusted funeral chariots used for members of the Thai royal family. Nearby, on the far side of the river, are the Royal Barges used for ceremonial processions on the Chao Phraya River.  Trek in the hills above Chiang Rai  A hill tribe trek has become an established part of the Thai traveller experience, but the traditional image of hill tribe farmers in native costume is harder to find with each passing year. The most popular spot for treks into the hill tribe heartlands is Chiang Rai, a place worth visiting in its own right for its northern-style monasteries and laid-back attitude.  Unwind with a traditional Thai massage  Traditional Thai massages – reputedly founded by the personal physician of the Buddha more than 2,500 years ago – is offered on every other street corner in Thailand. Some of the best practitioners are trained by the massage school at Bangkok’s Wat PhoThai Traditional Medical and Massage School (www.watpho.com), the home of Thai massage, or graduates from government training programmes for the blind and rehabilitated ex-convicts.  Walk across the Bridge Over the River Kwai  Internationally famous thanks to the 1957 film The Bridge on the River Kwai, the iron-bridge that spans the Kwai River was constructed as part of the Japanese Siam-Burma 'Death' Railway during WWII. An estimated 16,000 allied prisoners of war died during in its construction, and the bridge remains a poignant symbol of the Japanese occupation.",asia,,
paraguay,"There’s a saying in Paraguay that people who visit always cry twice – once when they arrive and once when they leave. And you can see why emotions might run high in this lesser-travelled South American nation, whose beautiful, beguiling and baffling character is made all the more alluring by its relative obscurity.      After years in the wilderness – Paraguay has long been politically as well as geographically isolated – the country is gradually opening up to the outside world. Its tourism infrastructure remains undeveloped, but patient and pioneering travellers are rewarded for their endeavours.      Boasting an intoxicating blend of crumbling colonial cities, exotic natural wonders and indigenous tribes, visitors to Paraguay can also expect a warm welcome from the locals, who are unerringly polite, interested in outsiders and liberal with their dinner invitations (expect football chat to be on the menu).      Most travellers begin their Paraguayan adventure in the capital, Asuncion. A charming, colonial city, it’s one of South America’s more endearing capitals and is blessed with neoclassical façades, pretty piazzas and tree-lined boulevards.      It is also a place of contradictions; expensive sports cars whizz along crumbling cobbled streets, while traditional street vendors ply their trade in the shadows of modern shopping malls. Inequality is hard to ignore.      Outside the capital, Paraguay’s true beauty is revealed. The east is characterised by sweeping savannahs and dense forests, which are peppered with sleepy colonial towns barely changed since the turn of the 20th century.      Crumbling Jesuit missions and yerba maté plantations can be found in the southeast corner, while the largely unexplored northern region is blanketed by steamy marshes, shimmering lagoons and dense rainforests, which harbour exotic species such as the elusive puma.      And then there’s the wild, western region of Chaco; one of South America's great wilderness areas, it is home for many of Paraguay’s indigenous people, who live largely traditional lives amongst a myriad of spectacular flora and fauna.","Paraguay  Attractions in Paraguay  Catch a football game  With Paraguay having reached the 2010 World Cup Quarter Finals and with many players in the major European leagues, football is an understandable passion in this country. Olimpia and Cerro Porteño are the two biggest teams in Asunción. A live game is a spectacular experience, although a little hairy – try and go with a local.  Cross the border to the Iguazu Falls  Meeting on what is called the Triple Frontera, the point where Argentina and Brazil meet Paraguay are the Iguazu Falls, one of the most spectacular sights on earth. The hectic and often overwhelming border town of Ciudad del Este is the perfect crossing point to the falls; you can cross the ""Friendship Bridge"" into Brazil or head south to Presidente Franco and take a ferry to Argentina.  Cruise the Paraguay River  Spend a few days travelling the Rio Paraguay, through the Pantanal wetlands, spotting wildlife and learning about the country's extraordinary history. River tours typically depart from Concepción, stopping at towns and national parks along the way.  Discover Paraguay’s only UNESCO sites  Don't leave Paraguay without visiting the crumbling settlements erected by Jesuits missionaries in the 16th century, who travelled through the region converting the indigenous Guaraní people to Christianity. They built vast complexes and encouraged the locals to abide by fairly rigid socioeconomic structures based on Jesuit values. Only ruins remain and the best preserved sites can be found at Jesús de Tavarangué and Trinidad del Paraná, which have been declared UNESCO World Heritage Sites.  Discover the ‘pearl of the south’  The lively waterfront area of Encarnación has earned a reputation as one of Paraguay's major tourist destinations. Locals flock to the beach during the summer season (December to February), which is brought to a close by the biggest carnival in the country.  Explore the capital, Asunción  The Paraguay capital is situated on the Bay of Asunción, an inlet off the Paraguay River. Planned on a colonial Spanish grid system, the old town has many parks and plazas. The newly built Costanera runs alongside the river and is a great spot to relax in an afternoon or go for a jog. Close by is the lively and colourful neighbourhood of Loma San Jeronimo, which holds regular events and offers the chance to experience traditional food. Even if there are no events on, it is a worth a trip because it has great views of the city.  Gawp at the Itaipú Dam  One of the seven wonders of the modern world, the Itaipú Dam is the largest hydroelectric complex in the world. The water reservoir has attempted to offset its environmental footprint by creating a unique ecosystem for wildlife and birds. Walking tours and fishing expeditions can be arranged at the dam.  Marvel at the Salto Monday waterfalls  Prepare to see the breathtaking waterfalls in Presidente Franco just south of Ciudad del Este, 326km (204 miles) east of the capital. The majestic Monday Falls, situated in a 22 acre national reserve, are 40m (131ft) high and are much less crowded than the Iguazú falls across the border.  Pay homage to Mariscal Lopez  Paraguay's modern history has been defined by the Triple Alliance War that ravaged the country from 1864 until 1870. The war was ended with the death of Paraguay's leader, Mariscal López, who was killed in battle at Cerro Corá. As well as a monument to the fallen leader, Cerro Corá National Park abounds with lookout points and hiking trails.  Ride with ranchers  There are dozens of estancias around the country where visitors can get a taste of rural life, ride with the cowboys, take a horse and cart tour or just sit and relax in the country drinking tereré (a herbal infusion).  Tour the tea plantations  Yerba mate tea is one of the most popular infusions in Paraguay and South America as a whole. In the 19th century it was exported as far afield as England and was exchanged for boats. The major plantations are located in the south of the country and guided tours are available from the city of Bellavista, home to two of the country's major Yerba producers (Selecta and Pajarito).  Trek through Ybycuí National Park  Flora and fauna abounds in Ybycuí, Paraguay's most visited national park. Set in a mountainous area, this forested wildlife haven is crisscrossed by a series of streams and waterfalls. Guided treks depart from the visitor centre, which also provides visitors with information about the park's history – surprisingly, it was once home to a munitions factory.  Unwind in San Bernardino  San Bernardino is a peaceful holiday resort situated on Lake Ypacarai, some 47km (29 miles) from the capital. Owing to its beaches and limpid lake, it's very popular with locals during the summer months. It has a camping ground and several good eateries, which celebrate the town's surprising culinary diversity. The Café Frances is a must for merienda (tea).  Venture into the remote Chaco  Witness the famous Chaco, a vast, sparsely populated area consisting mainly of empty plains and forests which covers 61% of the country's total surface. It is home to major national parks including the Defensores del Chaco, Tifunque, Enciso and Cerro Cora. It is a bird watchers paradise and if you are lucky Jaguars can also be spotted at night.  Visit the ‘seaside’ in landlocked Paraguay  Paraguay may be landlocked but the Paraná River is so wide at San Cosme y Damián that it gives the impression you have reached the coast. Impressive sand dunes along the banks of the river are a must-see and so are the Jesuit ruins in the town, which makes the perfect stop off for those travelling between Asunción and Encarnación.  Zip line through Eco Reserva Mbatoví  Located a short drive from Asunción, this wildlife reserve specialises in adventure activities to get the adrenalin pumping. Safely tied to a security rope, visitors clamber through the forests canopy, before zip-lining down to earth. There are also guided walks for those who like to keep their feet on the ground.",south america,,
estonia,"From reluctant Soviet state to one of the European Union's brightest young stars, Estonia has undergone something of a transformation in recent decades – and finally the world has woken up to its many charms.      The smallest and arguably most scenic of the three Baltic states (which also includes Latvia and Lithuania), Estonia is a wildly beautiful land of pristine forests, biodiverse wetlands and remote offshore islands; its natural assets offer a spectacular contrast to the brooding, gothic aesthetic of its medieval capital, Tallinn.      In Tallinn, the cobbled streets are peppered with historic churches, monuments and cosy cafés, not to mention a burgeoning restaurant scene that pays homage to the country's Baltic and Nordic heritage. The nightlife is pretty lively too, which has made it a popular destination for stag parties, although not everybody has welcomed that.      Most adventure travellers escape the city and make for the primeval forests and lakes of rural Estonia. And who can blame them? These areas offer landscapes and ecosystems which have, for the most part, been lost in much of Europe. More than 1,000 lakes shimmer in the Estonian countryside, while bogs and swamplands cover an astounding one-fifth of the country. These habitats are a haven for birds and birdwatchers.      Estonia's natural wonders are on impressive display in its national parks; most notably, Soomaa, in the heart of the country, and Lahemaa, on the northern coast, which rewards visitors with challenging hikes and impressive views of the Baltic Klint, a 1,200km-long (745 mile) ridge of limestone cliffs that stretches from Sweden to Russia. Elusive wolves, bears and lynxes can also be spotted in these parts.      Estonia's history, like that of its Baltic neighbours, has been almost singly devoted to maintaining independence from its powerful neighbours, most notably Russia. Annexed by Stalin in 1944, Estonia never entirely became the Soviet republic it might have done, retaining its language and culture far more strongly than other members of the USSR. This plucky, independent spirit endures in Estonia today.","Estonia  Attractions in Estonia  Haapsalu  Haapsalu (www.haapsalu.ee) is a small town on the western coast which has been a well-known resort since the 19th century. It is the ideal place to get away from it all with its romantic wooden houses and tree-lined avenues. A worthy diversion is the Raiway Museum which pays respects in the 'train graveyard' behind the museum.  Hiiumaa  Estonia's second-largest island, Hiiumaa (www.hiiumaa.ee) is a true oasis of tranquillity. Most of the island is covered with forests and scrublands, giving wildlife such as moose, deer and wild boars a chance to roam freely. Käina Bay is also a prime destination for birdwatching. During the winter months, visitors can reach the island via an ice road across the frozen Baltic Sea. Said to be the longest ice road in Europe, it is about 25km (16 miles) and usually open from January to March.  Mustvee  This quiet corner on the shore of Lake Peipus is home to Old Believers, a religious group who did not accept the official reforms of the Russian Orthodox Church and sought refuge here in the 17th century. A key attraction is the small Old Believer's Museum in Mustvee.  Narva  Narva (www.narva.ee), the easternmost town in Estonia, sits by the River Narva that separates Estonia and Russia. The Narva Castle is the main attraction. Nearby, the Narva-Jõesuu resort is home to a large sandy beach and many spas, drawing in a good crowd every summer.  National parks  Explore the unspoilt forest and bogs, picturesque old fishing villages and historic manor houses in one of Estonia's national parks and reserves – Kõrvemaa, Lahemaa, Matsalu, Soomaa and Vilsandi.  Pärnu  Established in the 13th century, Pärnu (www.parnu.ee) is the largest resort in Estonia, boasting a long sandy beach and a string of hotels offering relaxing spa services. Visitors can also engage in horse riding, birdwatching, and activities like making traditional dolls (Travnitsa) filled with herbs.  Saaremaa  The largest island in Estonia, Saaremaa (www.saaremaa.ee) is criss-crossed with hiking trails and dotted with bird-watching towers. Its coastal resort town Kuressaare has one spa for every ten residents; such high concentration is undoubtedly good news for visitors looking for a pampering session. A must-see on the island is the Kaali crater, a group of nine meteorite craters thought to be 3,500 years old.  Tallinn  Wander the magical medieval cobble-stone streets of the capital, Tallinn (www.visittallinn.ee), an ancient Hanseatic city. Particularly interesting is the Old Town, which is dominated by the soaring steeple of St Olaf's Church, once the tallest building in the world. Climb up to Toompea Castle for spectacular views. See the Tallinn travel guide for more information.  Tartu  Estonia's second-largest city, Tartu (www.tartu.ee) revolves around its prestigious University of Tartu and young people enlivening the many cafes and bars dotted across the city. Visit the university, the Botanical Garden and the A. Le Coq Beer Museum. The city also has a few quirky diversions including the Tagurpidi Maja (upside-down house), the Leaning House of Tartu (which is also home to Tartu Museum of Art) and the Crazy Scientist's Office.",europe,,
manitoba,"Overlooked by many, Manitoba could be Canada’s best-kept secret, spanning Arctic tundra and sprawling prairies, a classy capital and vast swathes of wildlife-packed wilderness.      At one extreme, there’s the sub-Arctic coastline at Churchill on Hudson Bay where you can spy frolicking beluga whales in summer or roaming polar bears in the autumn. At the other, there’s cosmopolitan Winnipeg, crammed with thrilling museums and fascinating historic districts.      In between, there’s not much at all other than a phenomenal landscape of sweeping farmland, flowering prairies and some 100,000 lakes, which support a range of wildlife including elk, black bears, wolves, muskox, moose and various migratory birds.      No wonder outdoor adventurers are in heaven, paddling the historic Hayes River, or camping at spots like Paint Lake Provincial Park for a hike to Kwasitchewan Falls.      If all that open space overwhelms you, head for the city. Winnipeg is usually either blisteringly hot or bitingly cold, but don’t let the weather put you off. The city boasts Canada’s oldest public gallery as well as the Canadian Museum of Human Rights, opened in 2014 and the first national museum built for nearly 50 years.      For a city plonk in the middle of the prairies, Winnipeg boasts a seriously impressive cultural line-up, including a professional ballet, symphony orchestra, theatre and opera. And who’d have thought it? Every single Canadian coin in your pocket was minted in Winnipeg.      Manitoba is a huge province with comparably few residents, but the people that do live there are renowned for their friendly, hospitable natures and embrace of diversity. Winnipeg is the centre of the cultural festival Folklarama, a celebration of Canada's ethnic communities. Manitobans themselves are a vibrant international mix, and include Icelandic, Japanese and Italian.","Manitoba  Attractions in Manitoba  Canoeing  Seal River in the north is one of the most challenging canoe routes in Canada. Whiteshell Provincial Park, a couple of hours from Winnipeg, offers a variety of routes from an easy afternoon paddle to a multi-week wilderness adventure. The Mantario trail is a four-day paddle through a beautiful system of lakes straddling the Manitoba-Ontario border.  Fishing  Several of the northern lakes are only accessible by air, and remote fly-in lodges are the answer to an angler's wilderness dream. Fish for trout, northern pike, walleye, channel catfish and Arctic grayling.  Folklorama  Canada's primary cultural celebration, Folklorama (www.folklorama.ca) takes place in Winnipeg each late July to mid-August. Go and be entertained and educated by a rich and diverse spread of food, music, dance and history from around the world - in particular, Canada's ethnic communities.  Icelandic Festival of Manitoba  The Icelandic Festival of Manitoba, in Gimli, is the largest Icelandic gathering outside Iceland itself; the province has strong historical connections to the country. It is a surreal experience eating Icelandic food and watching people wearing Icelandic garb in typical Canadian land.  Lake Winnipeg  On the eastern edge of the Interlake Region, Lake Winnipeg has good sandy beaches and boats for hire. The western shore was once New Iceland, a self-governing area settled by thousands of Icelanders fleeing volcanic eruptions in their homeland.  Manitoba's national parks  The province's national parks allow you to get close to some stunning scenery. The vast recreational area of Riding Mountain National Park is prime black bear-spotting country. Wildlife viewing, biking, backpacking and horse riding are all available.  Mennonite culture  Get a close-up view of early Mennonite life in the German-speaking Mennonite town of Steinbach.  Northern Lights  Manitoba's wide open skies and cool, calm starry night are perfect for viewing the Aurora Borealis (Northern Lights) in winter. Churchill is a good spot in which to do so.  River Souris suspension bridge  Walk across the River Souris on Canada's longest free suspension foot bridge. It is over 100 years old and is a massive 177m (582ft) long.  Wapusk National Park  A remote area with a severe sub-Arctic climate, Wapusk National Park is home to one of the world's largest known polar bear den sites, in addition to hundreds of thousands of waterfowl and shorebirds.  Watersports  The province's two huge lakes, Lake Winnipeg and Lake Manitoba, are very popular for watersports. The best-known spot is Grand Beach on Lake Winnipeg. Backed by high, grass-topped sand dunes, it's a favourite swimming spot among locals, owing to its shallow water and easy access. Sailboarding, windsurfing and sailing are on offer.  Western Region  You can see moose and wood bison in the Western region's densely wooded parklands. The Spirit Sands, a 5-sq-km (1.9-sq-mile) tract of sand dunes towering over 30m (100ft), are also well worth seeing. Minedosa is the region's flourishing tourist centre with shopping areas, a beach, restaurants and nature trails.  Whales  Beluga whales congregate at the mouth of the Churchill River by the thousand in summer. Churchill, a sub-Arctic seaport in the far northeast, is best reached by air across the vast flatlands running into Hudson Bay. It is known for its birdwatching and as a centre for polar-bear-watching tours in autumn.  Whiteshell Provincial Park  Soak up the flat, moss-wrapped terrain of Whiteshell Provincial Park, with its gorgeous lakes and forests.

new mexico,"Sensational sunsets, expansive deserts and wide-open plains; imposing mountain ranges, lush forests and gargantuan caverns; historic cities and a reputation for the extraterrestrial: welcome to New Mexico.      Nicknamed “the land of enchantment,” the state somehow manages to live up to that lofty billing with its spectacular topography and fascinating heritage. The Pueblo and Navajo Native American cultures are very much alive and well here, and a strong Hispanic lineage also helps determine its distinctive character.      New Mexico’s historic national parks include the equally overwhelming and enchanting Carlsbad Caverns (where you can watch Mexican free-tailed bats emerge at sunset), the beguiling beauty of White Sands, the awe-inspiring sight of Shiprock mountain in Navajo country, and the striking cliff dwellings and Pueblo settlements of Bandelier National Monument.

ghana,"They call Ghana “Africa for beginners”, which in many ways is quite the compliment. It’s a friendly and largely safe country, with a list of enticements as long as an Accra traffic jam: for a start, you’ll find sunshine, beaches, wildlife, national parks and a deeply colourful cultural heritage. The long tropical coastline is in some ways the most natural draw card for travellers, but you’re unlikely to come to Ghana for the sole purpose of lying on a beach. There’s too much going on for that.      The capital, Accra, is a vibrant but often misunderstood city, a heaving metropolis of food stalls and football shirts, music and markets, swish hotels and swirling street life. It has few big sights as such, but makes for an engaging introduction to the country as a whole. Further along the coast, there’s just as much to absorb in seaside settlements like Cape Coast, once a slave port but now a cultural destination in its own right. Its dark past is testament to the various European powers that at different times held sway in the region.      Inland, meanwhile, Ghana sets out its eco-credentials with habitats ranging from savannah to dense rainforest and hiker-friendly mountains to relatively arid sub-Saharan plains. Many of the individual national parks and game reserves are rather small compared to some other African countries, but the network is extensive.      In the far north, the plains of Mole National Park are still home to elephants, while in the south the forested Kakum National Park has a hugely popular treetop walkway, not to mention a range of animal and birdlife.      The northern city of Kumasi, the ancient capital of the Ashanti Kingdom, is another major draw. It remains the home of the Asantehene (Ashanti King) who holds court at his palace every sixth Sunday – one of many colourful traditional festivals, full of pomp and pageantry, that can be can still be seen throughout the country.","Ghana  Attractions in Ghana  Catch a show at the National Theatre  Watch a concert, play or dance at Ghana's National Theatre in the Victoriaborg district of Accra. A modernist masterpiece built by the Chinese as a gift to the country in 1991, the building is the base of the National Dance Company, National Symphony Orchestra, and National Theatre Players.  Chill out on the banks of the Volta River  The village of Ada Foah, with its picture-perfect location at the Volta's mouth, is the site of supremely chilled beach resorts, and one of the country's two official turtle-viewing sites. Anglers have the chance to catch barracuda and Nile perch. About 60km (37 miles) north, the stretch of river below Akosombo Dam is lined with resorts catering to all budgets.  Climb the battlements at Elmina and Cape Coast  The castles at Elmina and Cape Coast are the most impressive of the 20 plus forts and castles lining Ghana's coast. Both UNESCO World Heritage Sites, Elmina was built overlooking Benya Lagoon by the Portuguese, and was long a stronghold for the Dutch, while the British-built Cape Coast castle was once at the heart of the trans-Atlantic slave trade.  Cross Africa’s first canopy walkway at Kakum National Park  Situated just north of Cape Coast, this important rainforest reserve is home to a variety of monkeys and antelopes, as well as some lovely forest birds. Visitors can view wildlife at tree level from a wobbly but spectacular 333m-long (1,093ft) canopy walkway, the oldest construction of its kind in Africa.  Explore Ghana’s natural wonders  Bird enthusiasts should head to Owabi Forest Reserve and Bird Sanctuary, located close to Kumasi, to track some of the 161 species recorded there. Further to the northeast is the Bomfobiri Wildlife Sanctuary, containing the spectacular Bomfobiri Falls. The salt marshes of the Songow Lagoon are also a must for nature lovers.  Get up close to monkeys at Boabeng-Fiema Monkey Sanctuary  This tiny community-protected forest is the best place in Ghana for close-up encounters with two handsome monkey species – the Lowe's mona monkey and black-and-white colobus monkey – both of which are held sacred by the local villagers, who go as far as holding funeral rites for the animals when they die.  Haggle for souvenirs at Makola Market  Handicrafts including carvings and traditional textiles are for sale at the slightly dowdy Centre for National Culture. For an altogether more entertaining shopping experience try your hand at haggling at the busy Makola Market, which is attended by traders from Accra's surrounding villages. The Osu Night Market is illuminated by hundreds of lanterns and candles.  Hike to the summit of Mount Adaklu  Located 12km (8 miles) from the town of Ho, Mount Adaklu is one of Ghana's loftiest mountains at 600m (2000 ft) high. The guided hike to the summit not only promises the chance to see colourful local birds and butterflies, but also sees profits returned to communities nearby.  Join in at a tribal festival  Filled with traditional drumming, dancing and feasting, each region has its own annual festivals for the affirmation of tribal values, the remembrance of ancestors and past leaders, and the purification of the state in preparation for another year. One of the most spectacular is the Adae Kese festival celebrated by the Ashanti in and around Kumasi.  Make the most of the capital, Accra  Stroll around Accra's Independence Square, dominated by its Independence Arch, before heading to the gardens around the mausoleum of Ghana's first president Kwame Nkrumah. History buffs can continue on to Osu Castle and Jamestown lighthouse, while art lovers will find a large collection of Ghanaian art in the National Museum.  Marvel at the Wli Falls  Situated close to the Togolese border east of Hohoe, the waterfall at Wli – part of the Agumatsa Wildlife Sanctuary – is reputedly the tallest in West Africa, and certainly among the most spectacular. Visit in the late afternoon and wait for the tens of thousands of bats that nest on the surrounding cliffs to launch themselves skyward.  Paddle out to Nzulezu stilted village  Best visited in the rainy season when water levels are at their highest, this unique stilted village lies in the heart of the bird-rich Amansuri wetlands. It is most easily reached by dugout canoe from the beachfront village of Beyin near the Ivorian border.  Relax on the beach  Between them, the Atlantic coast beaches of Labadi Pleasure beach, Kokrobite beach, Coco Beach Resort, Dixcove, Busua and Ada offer laidback vibes, swaying palms, and spectacular breakers on almost deserted sandy shores. Strong currents can be a problem, so speak to the locals before heading for a swim.  See traditional architecture at Larabanga Mosque  Situated about 3km (2 miles) south of the main entrance to Mole National Park, this picturesque whitewashed mud-brick mosque is built in the peculiar Sahelian style of the region. Reputedly dating from 1421 and one of Ghana's oldest mosques, Larabanga is also known for its mystic stone.  Stalk Ghana’s wildlife at Mole National Park  The largest and one of the best-equipped game reserves in Ghana is home to elephants, various antelope such as roan, bushbuck, waterbuck and kob, and elusive populations of lion and spotted hyena. It is serviced by a decent and quite affordable hotel, and visitors can explore either on foot or in a 4x4.  Take a surreal look at Ghana’s fantasy coffin makers  The carpentry workshops of the world famous Fantasy Coffins can be found in Nungua, about 30 minute drive east of Accra. Among the Ga people it is fashionable to be laid to rest in a coffin that bears a relationship to what the deceased did in life, and visitors can see those coffins being crafted here.  Take in local traditions at Sirigu  Among the best organised and most rewarding of the numerous community tourism programmes, Sirigu is renowned for its curvaceous adobe architecture and brightly painted house exteriors that are typical of culture in Ghana's northern region, as well as the skill of its craft people's basketry and pottery.  Unwind on Busua’s beaches  This backpacker-friendly village on the west coast is arguably the ultimate Ghanaian beach venue, as well as supporting a nascent surfing scene and some great seafood eateries. The stunning beaches run for about 15km (9 miles) west to Cape Three Points, and are lined with several rustic and isolated budget resorts, including the legendary Green Turtle and newer Ezile Bay.  Visit Kumasi’s Ashanti legacy  The ancient Ashanti capital and Ghana's second city hosts several sites of interest, including Manhyia Palace (home to the Ashanti king), the Armed Forces Museum (housed in a 19th century fort) and the Prempeh II Jubilee Museum. Outside the city, a dozen scattered fetish houses, collectively a protected UNESCO World Heritage Site, are all that remains of traditional Ashanti architecture.  Watch your fingers in Paga  Set right on the border with Burkina Faso, Paga is known for its sacred crocodiles, which live in two pools close to the town centre, and are so tame that they allow visitors to touch them. Paga is also the base for visits to the poignant Pikworo Slave Camp and the impressive traditional architecture of the Paga Pia's Palace.",africa,,
scotland,"Crammed with sky-high mountains, rugged coastlines, romantic lochs, cultured cities and fiercely proud people, Scotland is an incredible destination with a wealth of attractions begging to be explored.      A holiday in Scotland means you could be quaffing single malt in the Lowland or following the footsteps of noble clansmen in the Highlands. That's assuming you aren't busy trailing Harry Potter on the real Hogwarts Express (the Jacobite Express steam train made famous in the Harry Potter films), tracking red deer in Cairngorms National Park, or lighting up your social media with jaw-dropping images taken while cruising along the North Coast 500, Scotland's answer to Route 66.      Scotland's largest cities, Glasgow and Edinburgh, are excellent city-break destinations where visitors can immerse themselves in the culture at various museums and galleries, in addition to shopping and fine dining. Beyond the cities, Scotland's charming historic towns, coastal villages and remote, Gaelic-speaking Highland communities also entice visitors with their scenic walks and warm welcomes.      Visitors who are after an electrifying festival experience won't be disappointed either. For three weeks in August, Edinburgh plays host to the Fringe, the world's largest arts festival. The varied programmes include cabaret, comedy, circus, dance, exhibitions, musicals, opera, spoken word events and theatre. Then there are the more eccentric Coal Carrying Race in Kelty and Porridge Making Championships in Carrbridge, among others.      Scotland is also a popular destination for outdoor enthusiasts. Adrenaline-junkies can hurtle down the rapids on the mighty River Findhorn near Aviemore, get behind the wheel of a supercar at Knockhill Racing Circuit, or snowboard at Cairngorm Mountain. If you prefer a more genteel diversion, tee off at St Andrews, the world-famous 'Home of Golf'.      Indeed, Scotland is studded with an astonishing number of attractions that have long mesmerised visitors and will continue to attract millions of visitors every year.","Scotland  Attractions in Scotland  Edinburgh  Scotland's compact capital, Edinburgh attracts visitors thanks to its striking architecture, tasteful culture, and world-class attractions. The Old Town, with the unmissable Edinburgh Castle perched high on an extinct volcano, is undoubtedly the biggest attraction. For three weeks in August, Edinburgh plays host to the Fringe, the world's largest arts festival.  Glasgow  Lively and continually reinventing itself, Glasgow is Scotland's largest city by population and a fantastic city break destination. Visitors come to sample architectural delights on the Rennie Mackintosh Trail, check out the city's transport collection at the Riverside Museum, learn about the past at the People's Palace, visit a live music venue, and of course, be among night owls for an unforgettable pub crawl experience.  National Parks  Scotland has two national parks that aim to preserve wildlife and habitats: the Cairngorms National Park and Loch Lomond & The Trossachs National Park. The former is home to many threatened species, including red squirrels and rutting deer. The latter comprises four distinctive areas (Loch Lomond, Cowal, The Trossachs and Breadalbane), with each area supporting a variety of wildlife.  Shetland  This geologically diverse group of about 100 islands are located between mainland Scotland and Norway. Shetland's miles of pristine coastline, gentle heathery hills, quiet wild swimming spots, and spectacular wildlife make it a worthy holiday destination.  St Andrews  St Andrews, a seaside town northeast of Edinburgh, is the 'Home of Golf'. The Old Course, the world's oldest golf course, is still a public golf course but golfers must meet the minimum handicap requirements.  Stirling  Historic Stirling is a small city with a big history, best known for the Battle of Stirling Bridge (one of the many battles of the First War of Scottish Independence) in 1297 and the National Wallace Monument commemorating the life of Sir William Wallace, Guardian of Scotland. Wallace was the leading literary subject in the Academy Award-winning film Braveheart.  The Highlands  A vast natural playground studded with misty mountains, windswept valleys (known as glens), tranquil lochs, and stretches of coastline, the Scottish Highlands are the perfect escape from busy city life. Among the many famous attractions is Loch Ness, Scotland's largest and probably most renowned loch, where the elusive monster Nessie lives, allegedly.  The Outer Hebrides  On the fringes of Scotland lies a chain of unspoiled, inter-connected islands known as the Outer Hebrides. Their powder-white beaches, epic moorlands, amazing wildlife and fascinating Gaelic culture offer endless adventures.  The whisky regions  Malt whisky is Scotland's national drink and the biggest export. Accordingly, visitors who enjoy a dram or two can visit over 130 active distilleries spread across Scotland's five whisky regions, namely Campbeltown, Highlands, Islay, Lowland and Speyside, with each region offering a unique perspective on Scotch whisky.",europe,united kingdom,
bermuda,"Bermuda is probably best known for two things: lurid, knee-length shorts and the fabled Bermuda Triangle, a stretch of sea where boats and planes are said to have mysteriously disappeared. However, these lazy stereotypes serve only to distract from what is an exceptionally beautiful destination.      Comprised of around 180 islets, Bermuda looks like your archetypal Caribbean retreat with its fine sandy beaches, colourful coral reefs and swaying palms. But it’s nothing of the sort. In fact this lonely archipelago floats 1,030km (640 miles) off the coast of South Carolina, adrift in the Atlantic Ocean, far from anywhere in particular.      A British Overseas Territory, Bermuda has embraced many traditions from the motherland: from sophisticated gents playing cricket to refined ladies supping afternoon tea. There are even red phone boxes.      Discovered by the Spanish in 1505, Bermuda fell into British hands a century later and has remained part of the much-diminished empire ever since. The legendary writer, Mark Twain, popularised the islands in the late 19th century. “You go to heaven if you want – I’d rather stay here instead,” he cooed. John Lennon was another fan of the archipelago, which was the muse behind his song, Borrowed Time.      For some time Bermuda has been considered a destination for the, shall we say, more mature traveller. And while its scenic golf courses, colonial hotels and genteel vibe do suit elderly travellers, the archipelago has started to attract a younger crowd in recent years. They come for the excellent scuba diving, the cycling and other adventure activities, or just to explore the beauty of the archipelago from the back of a motorbike.      And beautiful it is. Bermuda’s coastline is blessed with pink sandy beaches and crystalline waters, while inland visitors will find an abundance of subtropical plants and flowers, interspersed with quaint pastel cottages. There are certainly worse places to disappear.","Bermuda  Attractions in Bermuda  Cruise round the island by ferry  Enjoy a ferry trip round Hamilton Harbour for the best views of the pretty pastel-painted capital. For a longer cruise, take the passenger ferry – it passes through the Great Sound stopping at Somerset Bridge, the rural village of Somerset, and the Royal Naval Dockyard, some of the finest sights on the island.  Enjoy a picnic and picturesque panoramas at Fort Scaur  Visit Fort Scaur, a good place to picnic, swim and enjoy the panoramic view of the picturesque Great Sound. Designed so it couldn't be sighted from the sea, the 19th-century fort was built by the British in case of an American attack on the dockyard. Find the weather stone – its forecasts are never wrong.  Explore Fort St Catherine  Explore Fort St Catherine (built in 1614), the largest and most fascinating of the island's fortifications. Perched above the beach in the north west of the island, the stone ramparts and interior are both well preserved. Inside there is a museum dedicated to Bermuda's military history.  Gaze out from Gibbs' Hill Lighthouse  Marvel at the best view of the island from Gibbs' Hill Lighthouse, in Southampton parish, one of the only lighthouses in the world to be made completely from cast iron. With 185 steps to the top, the cafe at the foot of the lighthouse offers the chance to recharge your batteries afterwards.  Go fishing for some wahoo  With grey snapper, barracuda, marlin and wahoo, Bermuda is one of the world's finest fishing centres, especially for light-tackle fishing. Equipment may be rented for shore fishing and there are charter boats for reef and deep-sea expeditions. The best fishing is from May to November.  Guard from invasion at Gates Fort  Walk to Gates Fort, which dates back to 1620 and is built on a promontory overlooking Town Cut and the sea. Offering a spectacular view of the ocean and harbour, visitors can still see two mounted George III cannons, preparing to defend the channel to the harbour as they were in the 1700s.  Make a wish at the Moongates  According to oriental legend, honeymooners should make a wish while walking through Moongates. The circles of stone were brought to Bermuda in the 19th century by a sea captain who had seen them on a voyage to China. Unlike those in Chinese gardens, the Moongates at Bermuda are uniquely freestanding.  Open the world's smallest drawbridge, Somerset  In Somerset, on the western end of the island, find the smallest drawbridge in the world, Somerset Bridge. Designed so the yachts with unstayed masts can pass through, the gap is a mere 81cm (32 inches). Captains wishing to sail under must wait for a passer-by to open the timber bridge.  See the best of Bermudan nature at Hamilton Parish  Head to Hamilton Parish and investigate the Bermuda Aquarium for its exotic aqua life and try to spot the foureye butterflyfish. There is a Museum and Zoo onsite too. Nearby, the Crystal Caves of Bermuda, made up of sprawling underground systems and crystalline tidal pools, offer the most dramatic views on the island.  Smell the beautiful blooms at the Botanical Gardens  Sniff the heavenly scent of Bermuda and see the Double Fantasy flower that inspired John Lennon at the Botanical Gardens in Paget Parish. Walk among the magnolia trees at this impressive 14.5-hectare (36-acre) paradise, the best place to enjoy and identify the island's delightful flora.  Visit the historic Town of St George  Wander the narrow winding lanes of the town of St George, which has UNESCO World Heritage status. Founded in 1612, the garrison town is the earliest English settlement in the New World, its fortifications and landmarks appear much as they did over three centuries ago.  Wander Bermuda's charming capital, Hamilton  Explore the old charm of Bermuda's capital, Hamilton, taking in The Cabinet Building and the Sessions House. Front Street is Hamilton's main road, which runs along the water's edge, whilst the City Hall and Arts Centre is an architectural gem designed by the delightfully-named Wilfred Onions. For spectacular city views visit the restored 19th-century Fort Hamilton.  Witness the past at the World Heritage Centre  See the history of Bermuda's people come to life at the World Heritage Centre, St George. Both light-hearted and enlightening, catch a historical re-enactment while you're there, which includes the dunking of a nagging wench.

A short hop east from Manhattan, Long Island is a popular weekend escape for sweltering New York City dwellers. You can join the likes of J-Lo and Steven Spielberg by snagging yourself a posh summer home in the Hamptons or, more realistically, pitch a tent amongst windswept ocean dunes.

liechtenstein,"A pocket-sized principality in the heart of Europe, Liechtenstein rarely tops anybody's bucket list of continental must-sees. Yet this tiny, landlocked nation offers more than you'd imagine: from long-standing history to sky-high mountains; cliff-hanging castles to odd cultural quirks.  Many of Liechtenstein's historical highlights are located in the capital, Vaduz. While this tiny town may only have around 5,000 inhabitants, it also boasts an array of fascinating museums and galleries – including the Liechtenstein National Museum, the Museum of Fine Arts and the FIS Ski and Winter Sports Museum – as well as the atmospheric Prince's Wine Cellars and the neo-Gothic Vaduz Cathedral. All these attractions are watched over by the pretty Vaduz Castle, which remains the official residence of the Prince of Liechtenstein.  Vaduz isn't Liechtenstein's only town of historical note. The second town, Schaan, is actually larger than Vaduz, and comes with its very own impressive church and Roman remains, while Balzers in the south west boasts what is perhaps Liechtenstein's most arresting fortification. There are also beautiful chapels to be found in lesser-visited villages like Triesen and Planken.  And yet the true star of Liechtenstein is the remarkable nature. This country has arguably the most impressive landscape in Europe. Most of the peaks in Liechtenstein soar more than 2,000m (6,562ft) into the sky, making Liechtenstein a premier destination for skiing, hiking and mountain biking. Its shimmering lakes are also a big draw for swimmers.  As well as its permanent attractions, Liechtenstein also excels when it comes to unusual events. Some of the fun annual highlights include the Monster Concert (where troupes of musicians and dancers dress in outlandish costumes and bang drums), the Cattle Drive (where cows and sheep are festooned in colourful garments and adorned with bells) and the LGT Alpine Marathon (where competitors from around the globe run for 26 miles through the mountains).  Factor in Liechtenstein's dynamic dining, drinking and live music offerings, and you have a pocket sized nation that punches well above its weight.","Liechtenstein  Attractions in Liechtenstein  Admire the architecture in Balzers  Located in the far south-western corner of the country, Balzers is most renowned for its Burg Gutenberg, a 12th century castle teetering on a rocky hill over the centre of town. But it's also well-known for its two ornate chapels – the Chapel of St. Peter and the Chapel of Mariahilf.  Count the chapels  There are also beautiful chapels to be found elsewhere in Liechtenstein. Perhaps the best of the bunch are the beautiful 9th century St Mamerten chapel in the old part of the village in Triesen (renowned for its 14th century tower steeple) and the Chapel of St Joseph in Planken.  Explore the Ski and Winter Sports Museum  A must-see for ski lovers, this museum (www.skimuseum.li) explores the sport's long history. Former ski racer Noldi Beck has gathered more than 1,000 exhibits taking in a century of ski history, from 1920s ski-bending appliances to trophies from contemporary ski competitions.  Go skiing  Liechtenstein is a skier's haven. Ski at Malbun (1,600m/5,250 ft) and Steg (1,300m/4,250 ft). At Malbun, there are several ski lifts and a natural ice rink. Steg has a sledge run as well as its famous cross-country skiing loop with three distances (4 km/2.5 miles, 12 km/7 miles and 12.5 km/7.8 miles).  Hike around the castle ruins of Schellenberg  Actually two sets of castle ruins, most visitors climb up to the Obere Burg (Upper Castle) for a glimpse of history and a spectacular panorama. Originally built in 1250, then extended over a century, today the castle ruins are popular spots for local medieval festivals and recreations.  Marvel at the Museum of Fine Arts  Founded in 2000, the Kunstmuseum (www.kunstmuseum.li) is the national art gallery, and focuses on international contemporary art. Housed in an eye-catching modernist black cube in central Vaduz, the collection takes in art from the 19th century right up to the modern day. Artists featured include Rembrandt, Rubens and Van Dyck.  Pop in to the Postage Stamp Museum  Founded in 1930, this exhibition – one part of the Liechtenstein National Museum – tells the story of Liechtenstein's postal service throughout the country's history. The main focus is the series of postage stamps issued by the Principality since 1912, including original designs, test prints and needle plates, though the historical postal service equipment are also highlights.  Saddle up  As well as means of transport, cycling is a popular recreational sport in Liechtenstein, so why not cycle in the valleys and lower-lying areas of the country? There are 96 km (56 miles) of cycling trails on both sides of the River Rhine. Mountain bikers may also use the hiking trails.  Spend a day or two in Schaan  Schaan is Liechtenstein's largest municipality and boasts several tourist attractions. Local highlights include the St Maria zum Trost Chapel, DoMus cultural centre and a series of Roman excavations. Schaan also boasts some of the best restaurants and bars in the country.  Take a bird’s eye view of Lichtenstein  Those who want to see the country from a new perspective can also paraglide through the mountains of Liechtenstein – and beyond. For experienced paragliders, there are several launchpads across the country, while beginners can try a taster course with an experienced instructor, including a tandem flight.  Take a hike  There are plenty of hiking opportunities in Liechtenstein, and you will find hiking maps at the tourist office in Vaduz. One of the most famous hikes is from Gaflei, at 1,500m (4,920ft). This is the starting point for the Fürstensteig – a winding path along the high ridge that divides the Rhine and Samina valleys.  Take a tour of the Prince's Wine Cellars  Discover the country's long viticultural history on a tour of the Prince's Wine Cellars in Vaduz (www.hofkellerei.li). Visitors can take a tour, which includes a walk through the vineyards, which are perfect for growing Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, a stroll through the atmospheric basement and the chance to try a range of princely wines.  Visit Vaduz Castle (Schloss Vaduz)  Wonder at the Liechtenstein royal family home and the capital's most renowned landmark, Vaduz Castle. The original keep was built in the 12th century, but it was extended in the 16th and 17th centuries to become the impressive structure that today looms high above Vaduz.  Wander around the Liechtenstein National Museum  In a building that dates back to 1438, which has previously been a royal tavern, a customs house and a government building, is this fascinating national museum. There are hundreds of artefacts on display in the permanent exhibition here, including royal crowns, natural history specimens and nationalist paintings.",europe,,
new caledonia,"The Pacific island of New Caledonia is a nature lover’s paradise. Punching well above its weight, the island lays claim to impressive natural features including the largest lagoon in the world and a 1,500km-long (930 mile) coral reef, second only in size to Australia’s Great Barrier Reef.      Inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2008, New Caledonia’s vast coral reef offers some of the most spectacular diving in the world. Not only is it an important nesting site for green turtles, but it also supports an astonishing variety of tropical fish, seabirds, sharks, whales and dugongs, also known as sea cows.      Visitors will find an equally diverse mix of wildlife inland. New Caledonia is famed for its flying foxes and myriad exotic birds, including the highly intelligent Caledonian crow, which fashions hooks from branches to pick its insect prey from trees.      It’s not all about the wildlife, though. This former French colony, which is now classed as a special collectivity of France, is a fascinating melting pot of Melanesian and French culture. This unlikely fusion is most visible in the capital, Nouméa, where luxury hotels, gourmet restaurants and plush boutiques compete with Melanesian cuisine, dance and other local traditions.      This juxtaposition is not always harmonious however, and conflicts between France and New Caledonia sometimes flare up, reflecting their differing attitudes on self-government, French nuclear testing in the region and more. There’s been an appetite for independence for sometime now and the territory seems to be slowly moving towards sovereign status. France will be the poorer for it.","New Caledonia  Attractions in New Caledonia  Admire Amedée's towering lighthouse  One of the tallest in the world, Amedée Lighthouse was constructed in Paris during the reign of Napoleon III to prevent ships wrecking on the reef. Once completed in France, the iron tower was shipped to this coral reef in pieces. Visitors can climb the 247 steps to enjoy sweeping views.  Cast off on a fishing expedition  Relax on a fishing expedition. The coral barrier reef off Nouméa is excellent for underwater spearfishing, as are waters around the Loyalty Islands. Ouvéa Island's lagoon is rich in fish including the chance to catch a giant trevally. The main location for freshwater fishing is Yaté Lake, open January to October.  Discover the tranquil Ile des Pins  Venture over to the Ile des Pins, discovered by Captain Cook in 1774, and lying 70km (45 miles) off Grande Terre. This exceedingly beautiful island has many white sand beaches, turquoise lagoons, lush rainforests, pines, orchids and ferns not to mention archaeological remains. Day trips are available from Nouméa.  Explore the visually dramatic east coast  Hienghéne has a striking lagoon surrounded by 120m-high (400ft) black cliffs. The region is dotted with churches and Melanesian villages, forests, coconut palms and beautiful beaches. At the southern point of this coast is Yaté, a village surrounded by lakes, waterfalls and rich wooded countryside.  Kayak the largest lagoon in the world  Surrounded by a coral reef barrier 1,600km (994 miles) long, New Caledonia boasts the largest lagoon in the world. With excellent swimming and scuba diving, the most exciting way to explore is by kayak. H2O Odyssee in Nouméa offer four-day trips along the Forgotten Coast (Côte Oubliée) and reach land only accessible by paddle.  Saddle up and go horse riding  Horseback excursions are an excellent way to see the best of Grande Terre from simple pony rides to major expeditions crossing the mountain range, mustering cattle and camping in the mountains. Guided tours can be organised from Nouméa, Dumbea, La Foa, Bourail, Thio and the Koné villages.   See humpback whales in the southern lagoon  Go whale watching in New Caledonia's southern lagoon. Mating season for humpback whales begins in mid-July and the great creatures can still be spotted come September. During this time catamaran and cruise boat excursions cast off from Nouméa, whilst the massive mammals can be glimpsed near the Loyalty Islands at Lifou.  Seek out submerged ships with wreck diving  Enjoy some superb snorkelling, diving in marine reserves and around sunken shipwrecks. Favourite sites include the bays off Nouméa, the Amédée Lighthouse Reserve (including shark feeding), La Dieppoise (Royal Navy shipwreck), Ilot Maître and the peaceful Prony Needle, whilst the Tenia Horn, the Fault and the Hienghene Reef are all waiting to be discovered.  Tackle the trade winds with a windsurf board  Try your hand at windsurfing. The Bay of Anse Vata and Côte Blanche, both in Nouméa, are the most popular locations. With trade winds averaging between 20-40km (12-25mph), conditions are ideal for both beginners and the more assured, whilst international competitions attract some of the world's best windsurfers and make for exhilarating shoreline viewing.  Take a stroll around Nouméa  Explore Grande Terre's busy little capital Nouméa, which overlooks one of the world's largest sheltered natural harbours. It's home to attractive squares, a cathedral, museums, a market, many old colonial houses and Aquarium des Lagons, one of the world's leading centres of coral reef scientific research.  Take a traditional boat out to sea  Take to the water and explore the world's largest lagoon. Excursions in a traditional Melanesian outrigger canoes can be organised at the Ile des Pins, whilst sailing boats can be chartered with or without a skipper. New Caledonia's fantastic coral reefs are best goggled at through a glass-bottomed boats.   Take in spectacular panoramas at Mont-Dore  Soak up some scenery at Mont-Dore, a mountain surrounded by magnificent coastal views. On the way, stop at the Melanesian village of St Louis and the Plum Lookout for a spectacular vista across the surrounding reef. Also in the south, Blue River Provincial Park is well worth a visit for its breath-taking landscape.  Tread a trail through Grande Terre  Strike out on a hiking trip across Grande Terre. Starting in Prony, the Grande Randonnée trail heads north and takes in some of the country's most sublime scenery, before finishing in Dumbéa. At over 100km (62 miles), the well-marked trek is split into eight connecting hikes that can be enjoyed separately or as one walk over several days.  Uncover New Caledonia's rich culture  For a cultural fix, visit Nouméa's South Pacific Commission Building and New Caledonia Museum to see a collection of native handicrafts; try the Museum of Maritime History for artefacts from numerous local wrecks; and the Tjibaou Cultural Centre for concerts, plays and exhibitions celebrating indigenous culture.  Wind along the west coast beaches  Tour the pure white sand beaches, rainforest and offshore atolls of the west coast. There are elaborate and beautiful caves and rock formations shaped by Pacific breakers at Bourail, whilst further north is Koné, an important archaeological site following the discovery of ancient Lapita pottery believed to have its origins between 2000 and 1000 BC.",oceania,,
kazakhstan,"Unexplored by many, Kazakhstan is a curious yet little-known land of vast plains, mountainous horizons and beautiful culture. Bordering Russia in Central Asia, it's truly massive in size – this is, after all, ranked as the world's ninth biggest country. It's also the most economically successful of those countries surrounding it, known fondly as the 'stans'. This is largely thanks to oil reserves, as well as other natural resources. The upshot? You can expect more modern, higher-quality hotels, restaurants and travel options compared to some of the country's poorer neighbours.      South Kazakhstan is a focus of Central Asian history, featuring many famous monuments. It is a scenically diverse region where the snow-capped peaks, lakes and glaciers of the Tian Shan range give way to steppe and desert. The desert is home to the Singing Barkhan - a sand dune 3.2km (2 miles) long, which, as it crumbles, produces a peculiar singing sound.      Almaty was until very recently the former capital of Kazakhstan and it enjoys a beautiful setting between mountains and plains. Still the country's biggest city, it is a hub of modern architecture, cool fountains, parks and spectacular mountain views. You can also expect irreverent nightspots, trendy cafes, and palatial malls there. The present capital of Nur-Sultan (Astana) is following in its predecessor's footsteps as a modern metropolis, with its space-age buildings clinging to the northern steppe.      The truth is, though, that travellers are more likely to be attracted to Kazakhstan's natural wonders. It's a beautiful country in its own haunting way, where intrepid travellers will enjoy hiking through the lofty mountains and down in the valleys of the Tian Shan. Its sparseness can seem mind-boggling, but you'll find plenty of wildlife if you look for it, especially in the lake-strewn steppe. It's also worth seeking out the underground mosques and villages that are scattered about the land. All in all, Kazakhstan is a special, unique country well worth discovering despite it being low on the radar of most tourists.","Kazakhstan  Attractions in Kazakhstan  Almaty  Almaty is a city of modern architecture, wide streets, cool fountains, parks and squares and spectacular mountain views. Attractions in the city include the Panfilov Park, which is dominated by one of the world's tallest wooden buildings, built at the turn of the 20th century without using a single nail, and the Zenkov Cathedral. Also find fine museums such as the State Art Museum.  Archaeological sites  Several archaeological and ethnographic sites have been preserved in central Kazakhstan. There are Bronze Age and Early Iron Age sites and New Stone Age and Bronze Age settlements in the Karkarala Oasis. The Bayan-Aul National Park has rock drawings, stone sculptures, clean, sparkling lakes and pines clinging to the rocks.  Baikonur Cosmodrome  The Baikonur Cosmodrome, located 5km (3 miles) from the garrison city of Leninsk and 230km (143 miles) from Kzil-Orda, is the Central Asian answer to Cape Canaveral - tours are available, during which visitors can witness space launches. It was from here, on 12 April 1961, that Yuri Gagarin, the world's first cosmonaut, took off.  Hiking and trekking  The country's rugged landscape and incredible mountain ranges, offer great mountain climbing and trekking. The best season for trekking is between June and September.  Mountains and lakes  The Tien Shan Mountains stretch for more than 1,500km (932 miles), with the highest peaks Pobeda Peak (7,439m/24,406ft) and Khan-Tengri Peak (7,010m/23,000ft) - a snowy, marble-like pyramid. The huge Inylchek Glacier splits the summits and the beautiful Mertzbakher Lake lies at its centre. The Kolsai Lakes - known as the 'pearls of the northern Tien-Shan' - lie within the ridges of the Kungei Alatau range. Kazakhstan also boasts one of the largest lakes in the world: the unique Lake Balkhash is half saline, half fresh water.  Nature reserves  Kurgaldjino in the north of Kazakhstan houses the most northerly settlement of pink flamingos in the world, while Naurzum, offers a rich landscape of geographical contrasts: salt lakes ringed by forests, ancient pines strewn amongst sand dunes, pine forests growing out of salt-marsh beds, and rare animals such as hisser swans and grave eagles. Aksu-Zhabagly is a UNESCO biosphere reserve in southern Kazakhstan and home to 239 species of birds, 47 species of animals and 1,400 species of plants.  Relax at a spa  Kazakhstan has a wide range of spas. The most internationally renowned resorts include Sari Agach (in the south), Mujaldi (in the Pavlodar region), Arasan-Kapal (in the Taldikorgan region), Jani-Kurgan (in the Kzil-Orda region), Kokshetau and Zerenda (in the Kokshetau region) and those located in Zaili Alatau.  Watersports  All the regional centres boast sport complexes, swimming pools and training halls. Rafting and canoeing can be easily arranged through local travel agents. The Ili river between Lake Qapshaghay and Lake Balhash is a good place for this.  Winter sports  The 4,000m- (13,123ft-) high Zaili Alatau Mountains near Almaty offer great winter sporting activities. Near Almaty, the Medeu ice-skating rink is the largest speed-skating rink in the world; over 120 world records in ice skating and ice hockey have been set here. Watch Ice hockey games at the rink in Ust-Kamenogorsk. The winter sports complex of Chimbulak offers fantastic skiing, and many competitions are held here.",asia,,
andorra,"Tucked away in the eastern Pyrenees, the tiny Principality of Andorra is a land of narrow valleys and mountainous landscapes that’s popular for skiing and trekking. Its pretty villages and hamlets – dotted along the main road that traverses the country – are filled with Romanesque churches and houses, built in a unique, local style and preserved through the country’s seclusion.      Tracing its roots back to Ancient Greek times and Polybius’ mention of Iberian Andosinos, Andorra is not short of history. Tradition has it that Charlemagne rewarded the Andorrans for fending off the Moors by granting them a charter. It’s this peculiar independence, somehow enduring over the ages against successive threats, that has allowed Andorra’s beautiful architecture to remain so unspoiled.      Liberal snowfalls and an undulating chunk of the Pyrenees make for great skiing conditions; those who love wintersports will find some of Europe's best pistes here. Politicians and royalty of Spain choose Andorra’s white peaks for their skiing holidays – and prices are certainly geared towards the well heeled. During milder spells, Andorra also offers excellent hiking conditions, with sweeping valleys, challenging ascents and charming vistas.      The diminutive nation is administered from the capital city, Andorra la Vella, with two ‘Co-Princes’ as joint heads of states: the President of France and Bishop of Urgell in Catalonia, a tradition that dates back to the 13th century. The capital might not be to everybody's taste (think chock-a-block traffic barging between more shops than could possibly be required), but just a brief distance away lie some rural gems.       Villages such as Pal, a medieval settlement with an 11th century church, are well worth visiting. The Iron Route – by foot or bus – is also popular, taking visitors around the old town of Ordino. Andorra sees an incredible 10 million visitors a year, but wander off the beaten track and you’ll find many secluded Pyrenean spots to call your own.","Andorra  Attractions in Andorra  Bathe in the mountains at Escaldes-Engordany  Ever thought of bathing atop a mountain? Now you can in the spa town of Escaldes-Engordany, adjoining the capital. Enjoyed ever since Roman times, the natural hot springs here are perfect for soothing tired muscles after a day hiking or skiing. The town also boats some beautiful Romanesque architecture.  Explore the stone houses of Encamp  The small mountain town of Encamp is situated between the capital and the French frontier, and is a good base from which to begin hikes. Encamp is also well liked by tourists for its pretty stone houses and medieval church.  Go bargain hunting  Andorra's wide-ranging shopping opportunities offer prices that are much cheaper than many Europeans can expect at home. Much of this has to do with the tiny state's anti-tax stance – although this has recently begun to be softened under pressure from the European Union. Apart from taking advantage of great deals, there are many traditional local products worth stocking up on such as wine, cheese and, if you smoke, tobacco, which is grown here.  Hike in the Pyrenees  Many visitors to Andorra come to hike in the mountains amongst tumbling rivers, far-reaching lakes and glorious countryside. Easier strolls include the Camí Ral d'Ordino in the La Cortinada parish, and Camí de les Pardines in Encamp. Just remember to wrap up warm – it's cold pretty much all-year-round.  Relax at Europe's largest spa  Caldea is said to be the largest spa centre in Southern Europe. Treatments and facilities include high-pressure indoor and outdoor Jacuzzis, saunas, hammam, UVA cabins, massages and a whole programme of facial and body treatments. There's also a water bar and a night-time underwater music and light show.  Ski on renowned pistes  Go skiing at one of Andorra's many resorts; the main centre is Soldeu, but other ski centres can be found at Pas de la Casa-Grau Roig, on the French frontier, and at Ordino-Arcalis and Arinsal-Pal, all north of Andorra la Vella. Try cross-country skiing in the resort of La Rabassa.  Take in the views at El Serrat  Of the many picturesque mountain villages in Andorra, El Serrat is perhaps the finest of all. Many stay here while hiking or skiing nearby, but the breath-taking views of the Pyrenees are worth it alone. The hamlet lies approximately 18km (11 miles) from Escaldes-Engordany, off the main road.  Visit the UNESCO-listed Madriu Valley  The striking Madriu Valley, which cuts through about a tenth of the principality with its jagged cliffs and dramatic glaciers, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. As well as stunning views, the region abounds with traditional shepherd's cabins and quaint hamlets, which are the precious remains of an ancient Pyrenees farming culture.  Wander around Andorra la Vella  Nestling in a picturesque valley, at the junction of two mountain streams, Andorra la Vella is the only town in this tiny principality, which, by default, makes it the capital. As well as being the head of government, this tiny town boasts several sights including a fine, 12th-century church and Casa de la Vall, the ancient seat of government.  Watch a game  Andorra is bursting with spectator sports despite its small size. Watch a game of football – Andorra has a national team and play sits little heart out against bigger teams, even if victories are rarely forthcoming (it currently stands fourth from bottom on FIFA's world rankings). Rugby and basketball are also popular, so are motorbike and car rallies.",europe,,
canary islands,"Drifting like flotsam off the coast of northwest Africa, the Canary Islands have long been a popular destination for sun-seeking Europeans. Synonymous with sandy beaches, sprawling holiday resorts and glorious weather, the archipelago is comprised of seven islands, which form one of Spain’s most distant territories.     Gran Canaria and Tenerife are probably the most mainstream islands. Their family-friendly resorts and sweeping beaches are packed most of the year with tourists from Europe and beyond. Meanwhile, Fuerteventura is famous for its wind-driven water sports and has some of the finest beaches in the region.      Tourism is the lifeblood of these islands, but their dependency on this source of income has led to some unsettling consequences, such as rampant development of once beautiful coastlines and hedonistic holidaymakers breaching the peace.      While not all of the islands have found the balance between developing tourism and preserving local life, Lanzarote has managed to combine modern resorts with eco-friendly developments and more aesthetically sensitive designs.      While most visitors come to the Canaries for sun, sea and sand, the archipelago is of volcanic origin and offers strikingly diverse landscapes including sub-tropical flora, abundant pine forests, giant sand dunes and mountain peaks.      Want to escape the crowds? La Gomera is a charming and undeveloped island, which can be visited as a day-trip from Tenerife (just 30 minutes by ferry). Meanwhile, little-visited La Palma is green, uncommercialised and arguably the most beautiful island. And most westerly of all is El Hierro, windblown and well off the beaten track, it attracts a handful of hardy hikers each year.      Closer to Africa than Spain, the islands were conquered by the Castilians in the early 15th century and although they remain part of the motherland, the Canarians have a distinct culture, with many calling for greater autonomy and some independence.","Canary Islands  Attractions in Canary Islands  Enjoy the buzz of Las Palmas  With its magnificent location between two bays, Las Palmas is the impressive capital of Gran Canaria. A pretty, modern town and the island's liveliest, it sees plenty of action, and boasts a plethora of sights including Casa de Colón (Columbus House), the cathedral, market, Pueblo Canario and several museums. There's a fine beach too.  Feel the heat at Timanfaya National Park  Timanfaya National Park is an awe-inspiring moonscape created by an 18th-century volcanic eruption that covered around one-third of Lanzarote in lava. Take the coach tour, or to feel the heat of the volcano, book a walking tour; don't worry, it's dormant.  Go windsurfing in Fuerteventura  Join the pros and go windsurfing or kitesurfing off Fuerteventura's fabulous soft golden beaches. Giant dunes back unspoiled beaches in both the north of the island, at Corralejo, and in the south at Jandía, where world championship events are staged.  Head back to the start at Puerto de la Cruz  Spend a day in Puerto de la Cruz on Tenerife's north coast, which was the birthplace of tourism in the Canaries back in the 19th century. Splash out in the César Manrique-designed Costa Martiánez lido, explore the colonial-style old town and enjoy Loro Parque, one of the world's finest marine and wildlife parks.  Hike in the volcanic crater of Caldera de Taburiente  Take a hike in the Caldera de Taburiente on La Palma, one of the largest and most fertile volcanic craters on Earth, or just take in the view from the Mirador de La Cumbrecita. This national park is a wondrous green landscape of valleys and mountainous forms wreathed in cloud.  Marvel at the works of Lanzaroteño artist César Manrique  Don't miss the many César Manrique-related attractions. This great Lanzaroteño artist, landscape designer and ecological champion is seen by many as the patron saint of the island's culture, thanks to his fantastic creations. Jameos del Agua – elaborate sculpted caves – and Jardín de Cactus are perhaps the highlights.  Party at the Canaries' massive carnival  The best time to visit the Canary Islands has to be between February and March, when the carnival wave reaches Spain's southernmost frontier. The celebrations on Tenerife, in Santa Cruz and Puerto Cruz, are some of the biggest and most colourful outside Rio de Janeiro in Brazil.  Soak up Teguise's history in Lazarote  Head to Teguise, the picturesque colonial-style former capital of Lanzarote, for its aristocratic palaces, historic convents, churches and a castle built on a volcanic cone with great views over the town. Visit on a Sunday to enjoy the buzzing, colourful market.  Take a cable car up Mount Teide  On Tenerife take the cable car up Mount Teide, the highest point in all Spanish territory at 3,718m (12,198ft). It climbs to within 300m (1,000ft) of the summit – from where you can walk the rest (free permit required). Teide National Park was declared a World Heritage Site in 2007.

cambodia,"It might be one of Southeast Asia's smallest countries, but Cambodia can compete with the big boys when it comes to must-see sights. Once the preserve of trailblazing backpackers, this formerly war-torn nation is now firmly established on the Asia travel circuit. That luxury yachts ply their trade on Tonle Sap, Southeast Asia's largest freshwater lake, is a mark of just how far Cambodia has come.  Carving the country in two is the mighty Mekong River, which remains the lifeblood of Cambodia, running as it does from the bustling capital, Phnom Penh, to Vietnam's Mekong Delta. A journey down this iconic waterway is one of the great pleasures of Southeast Asia – boats of all shapes and sizes drift, chug and spray their way along the Mekong, carrying piglets, clay pots, bananas, motorcycles, you name it.  Away from the water, the ravages of war have become unlikely tourist attractions in Phnom Penh and other cities. Crowds gather at former prison camps and the notorious Killing Fields to contemplate Cambodia's darkest hour, a period of unimaginable suffering that took place under the brutal regime of Pol Pot. The crumbling remains of the Khmer Empire are the biggest draw in Cambodia, though. After building up a kingdom that stretched into neighbouring Thailand and China, the Khmers fell, leaving behind an extraordinary collection of temple complexes, most notably Angkor Wat, which owns the bragging rights to being the largest religious monument in the world. Then there are more typical Southeast Asian attractions – frenetic cities crammed with rickshaws, strange and exotic food, blissful beaches, tropical jungles teeming with wildlife, and a densely-forested hinterland full of tribal villages. There are few places that have been through as much as Cambodia, but this optimistic nation has belied its tumultuous history and emerged as one of the warmest, most welcoming destinations in Southeast Asia.","Cambodia  Attractions in Cambodia  Angkor Wat: a must-see destination  Angkor, the former capital of the ancient Khmer Empire, is one of the greatest and most spectacular religious sites in the world. Construction of this elaborate temple complex – built in honour of the Hindu god Vishnu – began in AD 879 but the site was lost to history for centuries before being rediscovered by Frenchman Henri Mahout in 1860.      The Bayon is perhaps the most magnificient of all the structures at Angkor. From its monumental towers, a series of colossal stone faces, depicting the Buddhist deity Avalokitesvara, gaze out serenely across the temples and jungles. The atmosphere is mesmerising, particularly at dawn, when the faces loom dramatically out of the mist.      The Angkor complex sprawls for miles through the jungle, but roaming to outlying temples is part of the magic. Hire a bike and spend days exploring the temples, shrines and palaces, from the famous spires of Angkor Wat and the magnificent Bayon, to overgrown Ta Phrom and the remote temples of Bantaey Srei.  Bokor Hill Station (Preah Monivong National Park): imbibe history  An abandoned French hill station in the south of the country, Bokor was built originally as a weekend sanctuary for settlers stuck in stifling Phnom Penh. Like a Wild West ghost town, it's best known for its derelict hotel, which stands as an eerie reminder of the extravagant final years of French Indochina.  Choeung Ek Killing Field: a heart-rending journey through history  To get a clearer understanding of Cambodia's darkest hour, visit the Choeung Ek Killing Field, 17km (11 miles) south of Phnom Penh. The Choeung Ek Monument contains more than 5,000 human skulls and the surrounding pits still littered with human bones. It makes for a sobering experience that will stay with you long after you leave the country.  Kampot: kick back in Kampot  A sprawl of dilapidated shophouses on the riverbank, the southern town of Kampot provides a gateway to nearby national parks, cave temples at Phnom Chhngok and Phnom Sorsia. Travellers love Kampot for it's laid-back atmosphere and relaxing pace of life.  Kep: feast on fresh seafood  Cambodia's coastline offers the full sun, sea and sand experience, but for many visitors, the big appeal is Cambodia's ocean-fresh seafood. While all along the coast menus are graced by fresh fish, prawns, squid and lobster, Kep the coastal province is particularly famous for just-caught crab.  Kratié: go dolphin spotting  The Mekong town of Kratié (or Kracheh) is a popular place to see Irrawaddy river dolphins, one of the rarest of all aquatic mammals. Various tour operators organise early-morning boat trips to observe these peaceful creatures in their natural habitat, but time is running out for these graceful animals – only 80 are thought to survive in the Mekong River.  Mekong: take a river cruise  The boat trip from Phnom Penh to Siem Reap is one of Asia's legendary traveller journeys, and by far the most atmospheric way of reaching the Angkor temples. On the journey along the Mekong River and out onto Tonle Sap lake, you'll absorb some of the spirit of Cambodia's life-giving waterways. The trip upstream to Battambang is even more scenic.  National parks in Cambodia  Large areas of Cambodia have been set aside as national parks. The southwest region is home to several including Kep National Park, Preah Monivong Bokor National Park, Ream National Park, Boutum Sakor National Park and Kirirom National Park. In the north, Phnom Kulen and Virachey are both outstanding national parks well worth a visit. Just 40km (25 miles) south of Phnom Penh is the Phnom Tamao Wildlife Sanctuary which provides a safe home for tigers, elephants, gibbons and other animals rescued from poachers and traffickers.  Phnom Penh: Cambodian Water Festival  As in neighbouring Thailand, the changing seasons in Cambodia are marked with major festivals, and the biggest of all is Bom Om Touk, held in October or November, when the flow of the Tonle Sap River changes direction. Visitors congregate in Sisowath Quay (in front of the Royal Palace in Phnom Penh) for three days of merry-making, free concerts and boat races.  Phnom Penh: marvel at Khmer art in the National Museum  Staggering amounts of Khmer art were looted during the Khmer Rouge years and sold on the international art market, but some of the finest examples of Khmer artistry now take pride of place in the National Museum in Phnom Penh. Among the impressive collection are statues and sculptures and ceramics. The building was constructed by the French in 1917.  Phnom Penh: pay your respects at Tuol Sleng  Set in the former Phnom Penh high school that would later become the notorious S-21 detention centre, Tuol Sleng today acts as a haunting memorial to the genocide of the Khmer Rouge era. Torture instruments remain in some rooms and the walls are lined with photos of the tens of thousands of victims who passed through before vanishing in the Killing Fields.  Phnom Penh: shop for silver  Prized across Southeast Asia since the 11th century, silver is one of the most sought-after Cambodian souvenirs and it is made into a remarkable range of objects, from anklets and jewellery to elegant bowls and betel nut storage tins. Most items are decorated with intricate designs, applied using the repousse technique, with tiny hammers and punches.  Phnom Penh: support the Daughters of Cambodia   Overlooking the river in downtown Phnom Penh, Daugthers of Cambodia aims to help at least 100 girls each year to permanently walk free from sex-work and find alternative employment. Support them by visiting their fair-trade café, shop and spa.  Phnom Penh: swing by the Royal Palace  Phnom Penh's showpiece attraction was built in the 1860s, and it cuts a handsome figure on the skyline, crowned by a series of stupas and towering spires. The royal family were driven from the palace during the Khmer Rouge era, but the monarchy was restored in 1993. The adjoining Silver Pagoda houses a number of ancient and revered Buddha statues.  Siem Reap: move to Khmer rhythms  Classical Khmer dance is one of Asia's great dance traditions and displays have become a popular tourist attraction. Many international hotels around Siem Reap stage tourist shows, but you can see spontaneous dances across the country during monastery feast days. Also listen out for the haunting psychedelic rock of Ros Sereysothea, who vanished during the conflict.  Sihanoukville: relax on the sands  On the edge of Ream National Park, Sihanoukville is a popular backpacker beach hangout with a decidedly relaxed atmosphere. As unspoiled public beaches are hard to find around Sihanoukville nowadays (though private beaches still retain their pristineness), visitors can take ferries to nearby islands for a day of fishing and snorkelling.      Koh Rong, an island off Sihanoukville in the Gulf of Thailand, promises an authentic sand-between-your-toes coastal break. Koh Rong is accessible by ferry from Sihanoukville and has a small selection of bars for you to enjoy while lapping up the salt, sun and surf.",asia,,

namibia,"From the seemingly endless sand dunes of the Namib Desert to the tropical wetlands of the Caprivi Strip, Namibia is a country of epic landscapes, bountiful wildlife and few people. Its greatest assets are the rugged Namib and Kalahari deserts, which support a surprising diversity of fauna including rare black rhinos, cheetahs, and vast groups of gemsbok, zebra and ostrich.      Parts of Namibia can be harsh and unforgiving, and nowhere is this more evident than along the Skeleton Coast. Shrouded in thick fog, lashed by Atlantic waves, occupied by shifting dunes, and littered with rusting carcasses of ships ran aground on its shores, this area certainly makes travellers feel like they are far removed from civilisation.      Away from the dreamscape of sand and rock, the wildlife-rich Etosha National Park is another must-see. During the dry season, herds of wildebeest and dazzles of zebras congregate at waterholes scattered around the park, while predators wait patiently for a chance to pounce – the dramatic scenes of pursuit offer unforgettable experiences.      Other worth-noting national parks are Ai-Ais in the south and Khaudum in the northeast. The former is home to the Fish River Canyon, Africa's largest canyon, while the latter welcomes more elephants than people to the park.      Namibia's capital is Windhoek, a vibrant, modern city perching on the Khomas Highland in central Namibia. Its colonial architecture, thriving culinary scene and excellent beer make it a pleasant place to while away a few days.      On the whole, Namibia is delightfully wild and unspoilt, offering plenty of off-the-beaten-track destinations for travellers to experience the ultimate safari adventure, capture stunning landscape shots, and above all, find quiet and solitude.","Namibia  Attractions in Namibia  Damaraland  Damaraland refers to the vast swathes of land covering the north-central region. Highlights include Twyfelfontein and Brandberg Mountain for prehistoric rock engravings – of which the White Lady of the Brandberg is best known, and Spitzkoppe, Burnt Mountain and Organ Pipes for geological wonders.  The north side of Damaraland also has a large number of wildlife, including gemsbok, zebra, hyena, elephant and the endangered black rhinos.  Fish River Canyon  The Fish River Canyon is Africa's largest canyon and the highlight here is a five-day 90km (56mi) hiking trail along the canyon floor to the Ai-Ais Hot Springs. As there are no shelters and no provisions along the way, all hikers may supply a medical certificate as proof of good health and apply for a hiking permit in advance. The trail is open from mid-April to mid-September.  Lüderitz  Founded by Franz Lüderitz, a Hamburg merchant, the town became a German protectorate in 1883 and thrived when diamonds were found in nearby Kolmanskop. Today, its surreal German art nouveau architecture, built in the late 1880s to early 1900s in a seemingly unforgiving landscape, is the main tourist attraction. Kolmanskop, now a ghost town, is also worth a visit.  National parks and reserves  Namibia's national parks and game reserves cover 18% of the country's area. Namib-Naukluft is the country's largest conservation area and is characterised by rolling red dunes and rocky escarpments where desert animals roam. Etosha National Park is probably the most popular and is home to 114 mammal species and over 400 bird species. On the other side of the scale, Khaudum National Park in the remote Kalahari Desert welcomes more elephants than visitors to the park.  Skeleton Coast  Despite the ominous name, the Skeleton Coast is strikingly beautiful. Stretching 500km (310mi) across northern Namibia, the otherworldly landscapes of shifting dunes, gravel plains and wide expanses of sand, punctuated by ghastly sand-covered shipwrecks, are wild yet captivating. The sand here sings, too – moving sand creates a noise that resembles rumbling thunder, which the locals call 'the lion's roar'.  Swakopmund  Swakopmund is another colonial town that has retained a decidedly European feel, with attractive old German houses dotted around and many restaurants serving German classics. Swakopmund is also a thriving seaside resort – you can swim in the ocean, kayak to see the seal colony at Pelican Point, venture into the Namib-Naukluft National Park or explore the Skeleton Coast.  The Caprivi Strip  The Caprivi is a narrow strip of land protruding from the north-eastern corner of Namibia and stretching eastward towards Zambia. This is the rainiest area in Namibia and naturally, you can expect lush vegetation and rich wildlife, including more than 450 species of bird. The best time for bird watching is from November to April – the nesting period for native species while many migrating birds are also present.  Walvis Bay  This coastal city is a magnet for adventure seekers keen to explore the dunes, ride the waves, kayak to see a massive colony of seals in Pelican Point, or join a cruise in search of dolphins. The spectacular views of flamingos and pelicans on the tidal lagoon shouldn't be missed too.  Windhoek  The attractive Namibian capital features German colonial architecture including the iconic Christuskirche (Christ Church), which resembles a gingerbread house. A tour of the National Museum and National Botanic Garden is also recommended. In the centre of Post Street Mall, Windhoek's shopping hot spot, there's a quirky display of the meteorites that hit southern Namibia in prehistoric times.",africa,,
st lucia,"Trade winds keep temperatures on the right side of sizzling in sunny St Lucia, where white sandy beaches, crystalline waters and luscious rainforests paint the quintessential picture of Caribbean island idyll.      St Lucia is in the business of creating lasting first impressions: visitors to the island are greeted by the unforgettable sight of the Piton Mountains, which are fringed by coral reefs, sandy shores and swaying palms as they rise majestically from the rolling surf.      While other Caribbean islands lay claim to equally beautiful beaches, St Lucia will tempt you out of the sun-lounger and into the ocean with its bountiful marine life and exquisite reefs, which are a playground for scuba divers and snorkelers. St Lucia’s waters are also prime for kite-boarding and windsurfing, thanks to the aforementioned trade winds.       It’s not all about the coast, though. A trip to the island’s interior presents the opportunity to hike through verdant mountains, zip-line over forest canopies and watch boiling sulphur springs bubble away atop a volcano, all in a day’s work. If you’ve still got the energy for a night out, there are regular shindigs in the north of the island. Friday nights get particularly lively.        Here visitors can experience the relaxed flavour of island life, as well as the unique mixture of West African, European and East Indian influences that infuse the local cuisine. St Lucia is also known for its folk music and world-famous Jazz & Arts Festival, which takes place every year amidst much fanfare.        The island carries a unique cultural heritage, having changed hands between Britain and France no fewer than 14 times. The British eventually lost control in 1979, and St Lucia gained its independence. Various cultural legacies linger, from the colonial-style plantations that dot the landscape, to the French-influenced patois spoken throughout the country.      The result is a destination that will captivate visitors long after the emerald-green peaks of the Pitons have disappeared over the horizon.","St Lucia  Attractions in St Lucia  Anse Chastanet  Go snorkelling and scuba-diving on St Lucia's natural and artificial coral. It is not uncommon to see turtles, nurse sharks and seahorse whilst swimming in the clear blue waters. Popular diving sites include Anse Chastanet, Anse Le Raye, Coral Gardens at the base of the Gros Piton, Fairy Land at the base of Anse Chastanet and Lesleen M Shipwreck.

Choiseul  Visit the picturesque little villages of Choiseul and Laborie, which are surrounded by splendid vegetation. The Morne Coubaril Estate (www.stluciaziplining.com) is also worth a visit with cocoa, manioc and sugar cane plantations to visit, plus there are ziplining activities for the more adventurous.  Diamond Waterfalls  Marvel at the Diamond Waterfalls in the Diamond Botanical Gardens and Sulphur Springs - St Lucia's 'drive-in volcano'.  Go sailing  Hotels offer hobbycats, dinghies and small speedboats by the hour or half-day. From Marigot Bay and Rodney Bay, the more experienced sailor can hire a variety of craft. Tour operators can also arrange for stays to be coupled with a 'free floating' holiday on board a chartered yacht visiting the neighbouring islands.  Gros Islet  Check out the weekly Friday street party at Gros Islet, on the northwest coast of the island, stages a street party every Friday. Nearby Pigeon Island National Landmark has a small museum telling the history of the island. It was from here that Admiral Rodney set sail in 1782 and destroyed the French fleet in the Battle of the Saintes, one of the most decisive engagements in European history.  Marigot Bay  Head to the top of Marigot Bay, a secluded, palm-fringed paradise. From here you can visit the Cul de Sac - an area famous for its three large banana plantations where the original Dr Dolittle was filmed.  Morne Fortune  Walk up Morne Fortune, where visitors have the chance to see the fortification which defends Castries. It also provides a magnificent panorama of the city and the surrounding area.  Plantation tour  Travel back in time on a plantation tour. Fond d'Or Nature Historic Park covers the Amerindian settlements and historic buildings of the sugar age and the tropical forest surrounding it.  Rainforests and mountains  Explore the island's rainforest, mountain and plantation walks. Local guides are available to help climbers tackle the Pitons. The main areas designated for birdwatching are the Bois d'Orange Swamp, Boriel's Pond and the Piton Flore Reserve.  Soufrière  Take a trip to Soufrière, the second-largest settlement on the island. This deep-water port stands at the foot of two extinct volcanoes known as the Pitons. Rising to 798m (2,619ft) above sea level, these are probably St Lucia's most famous landmarks. The town itself is typically West Indian, a cluster of brightly painted arcaded buildings set against the jungle vista.  Turtle and whale watching  Head out to sea on a turtle and whale watching trip - a great experience for all animal lovers. St Lucia is said to be one of the best places in the world to see whales - 20 species can be seen off the coast, including sperm whales, pilot whales and humpbacks.",caribbean,,
south korea,"South Korea can come across as inscrutable at first glance. It’s a land of stark contrasts and wild contradictions; a place where tradition and technology are equally embraced; where skyscrapers loom over ancient temples; and where the frantic pace of life is offset by the serenity of nature. The country’s unique customs and etiquette can seem like a trap laid for foreigners, but arrive with a smile and a respectful attitude and you will be welcomed with open arms by some of the friendliest folk on the planet.      Koreans are fiercely proud of their country, and with good reason. The Korean peninsula has a storied history and this colourful heritage is woven into the fabric of this land. The capital, Seoul, is home to a number of historic highlights, including the spectacular Joseon-era Gyeongbokgung Palace, “the great south gate” of Namdaemun and the eerie Seodaemun Prison – all tucked away amid gleaming offices, giant shopping centres, world-class restaurants and hipster bars.      The rest of the country is also littered with fortresses, temples and palaces. Visitors will enjoy the grassy burial mounds of ancient kings in Gyeongju, the Seokbulsa Temple in Busan, which has been carved out of a rock, and the infamous demilitarised zone, a biodiverse no-man’s-land separating South and North Korea. It is a scary place, where acres of barbed wire are patrolled by heavily-armed guards on both sides, yet the tension is so trumped up it feels like you’ve stumbled onto a Hollywood film set.      But it's not all about history. When it comes to nature, South Korea is wonderfully diverse, with spectacular national parks, remote sandy beaches, hot spring islands and rugged mountain peaks. Gastronomes are well catered for, too, but you may have to open your mind before your mouth; local specialities include kimchi (pickled cabbage) and makgeolli (rice wine).      South Korea can sometimes seem like the most foreign place on Earth; an unfathomable destination of curious customs, strange food and jarring paradoxes. Ultimately, that’s what makes it so exciting.","South Korea  Attractions in South Korea  Admire Seoul from way up high  Ascend the 238m-high (776ft) N-Seoul Tower, a viewing spire conspicuously situated atop landscaped Namsan Mountain, for an unparalleled vista of Seoul's majestic cityscape.

Cruise around Hallyeo Maritime National Park  Travel to the Hallyeo Maritime National Park in the southeast for a cruise around the archipelago, dotted with 400 islands. This is where Admiral Yi Sun-Sin (an Admiral Nelson-like figure) defeated the Japanese in the sea battles of the 16th century. Hire a bike and pedal the well-marked trails for the best of the seascapes.  Dare to try the spicy seafood of Suwon City  As one of Seoul's largest suburban areas, Suwon has all kinds of things for the tourist to enjoy. The UNESCO-listed city walls and defences of Suwon City and Hwaseong Fortress are among of the most famous sights, but nightlife is another of its big draws. Try the fiery hot seafood broth Jjambbong – and make sure your hotel has a bidet.  Discover the Cheonggyecheon Stream sculptures  This revitalisation project was quite controversial and cost Seoul taxpayers dearly, but this river (which was once a sewage trickle beneath the pavement) is now a lengthy walking area with art exhibits, performances, sculptures, and even make-out spots for lovers. The Candle Fountain is popular highlight after dark.  Explore the 'museums without walls' at Gyeongju  Visit Korea's 'museum without walls' at Gyeongju, near Busan. The capital of the Silla Kingdom for 1,000 years, it is packed with history and Buddhist culture, all designated by UNESCO as one of the world's 10 most historically significant sites. After exploring the city, take in the best history museum in South Korea, Gyeongju National Museum.  Hike through Seoraksan National Park  The Seorak mountain range is considered to be the most beautiful landscape in the whole of South Korea, and with its austere pinnacles of rock, its verdant forests, rushing spring streams, waterfalls, and temples, it's got everything a hiker might want to see. For trails over a day long, a guide is recommended.  Hit the slopes at the Alps Ski Resort  For winter sports, head to the Alps Ski Resort or another of the 13 ski resorts within four or five hours of Seoul. The city of Pyeongchang has plenty of powder, such as the excellent Dragon Valley (Yongpyong), and will host the 2018 Winter Olympics. Odaesan National Park is also famous for its off-piste action.  Meditate in a Buddhist temple  Learn about South Korea's Buddhist heritage by experiencing the serenity and sanctuary of a temple. The country has over 10,000 temples and 20,000 monks and visitors can even stay at some of them, practising meditation, lantern making, tea ceremonies and simple elements of Buddhism.  Ride the underground to a National Park  Whether you hike, birdwatch or rock climb, check out relics and visit the temples and fortress in the mountains of the Bukhansan National Park. They are some of the most favoured in South Korea, and they're not far outside Seoul - they even have their own stop on the underground.  See the secret side of Seoul  See the sights of Seoul: Changdeokung is an exquisite Joseon palace and its picturesque Biwon (secret gardens) are enchanting but can only be visited with a guided tour. Nearby Jongmyo Shrine contains ancestral tablets of the Joseon Dynasty. The huge National Museum of Korea is architecturally and culturally fascinating.  Shred nerves at the world's largest theme park  Join in the Korean love of theme parks by visiting Lotte World in Seoul as well as the outdoor attractions of Magic Island, which features one of the world's largest indoor theme parks. Else, head an hour outside the capital to the vast Everland leisure complex, which boasts the Caribbean Bay water park, Hoam Art Museum and even a zoo.  Speed to Busan on the KTX train  Jump on Korea's pride and joy, the KTX high-speed train, launched in 2004 and capable of travelling at 300kph (186mph). Take it to the bustling port of Busan to see Jagalchi Fish Market (not for the squeamish), Busan Tower and the 1,300 year old Beomeosa Temple.  Step back in history at the Korean Folk Village  In Yongin, about 45 minutes south of Seoul, this excellent folk village is where you can meander through live demonstrations of various traditional Korean arts, crafts and games, and see how buildings were made centuries ago. Fun for all ages and interesting to boot, this living museum is a must see.  Uncover the Buddha above Bulguksa Temple  Soak up the wonderful atmosphere of Bulguksa Temple. This large wooden temple is beautifully painted and the stone Dabotap features numerous cultural relics. A winding road high on the mountain above leads to the Seokguram Grotto, with the magnificent granite Buddha looking serenely down through his protective glass case.  Unearth the wooden blocks of Haeinsa Temple  Set in the idyllic Gayasan National Park, Haeinsa Temple was originally built in AD 802. It eventually reached its present-day size during the mid-10th century and is famous for housing the Tripitaka Koreana - 80,000 wooden printing blocks carved during the Goryo Dynasty. The temple also houses a great number of artefacts including the Seated Stone Buddha and Stone Pagoda.  Visit the volcanic Jeju-do island  Korea's 'Hawaii' is just off the southwest coast and it features Mount Hallasan, Korea's highest mountain at 1,950m (6,400ft). Atmospheric 'stone grandfather' statues (made from black lava) can be found all over the island, alongside spectacular waterfalls and impressive volcanic scenery. Go underground and marvel at the Manjanggul Lava Tubes or greet the dawn at Seongsan Ilchulbong Peak.",asia,,
ukraine,"Vast and mysterious to many, Ukraine is barely known to outsiders despite being one of the largest countries in Europe. Long-associated with its colossal neighbour Russia, it's a country that stands out in its own right for its varied landscapes and surprising cultural diversity.  To the majority of those visiting for the first time, the reputation of Ukraine's hardy inhabitants can seem formidable. But while, much like in neighbouring Russia, cracking a smile at a stranger in the street is deemed a sure sign of madness, locals tend to be a thoroughly welcoming lot once you've broken the ice. Before long they'll be showing you round the sights and inviting you to their home for a steaming borscht – the country's iconic beetroot soup.   Ukraine's natural side is also seen as tough – and it's true that in winter snow covers most of the land as temperatures plummet. During the rest of the year, though, it's surprisingly clement. What's more, with its largely unspoilt, verdant interior, Ukraine is ideal for hikers and cyclists.  The Carpathian Mountains that spill over the border with Poland, Hungary and Romania dominate the west of the country while flat plains carpeted with sunflowers and cereals make up much of the central and eastern region. To the south are the almost Mediterranean-like Black Sea coast and the Crimean Peninsula, which remains a huge draw for holidaymakers every summer. And even when snow falls through the winter, the landscape is beautiful, while there are many old churches and Soviet-era buildings to dive into for shelter.Ukraine's capital, Kiev, founded in the eighth century, displays a heady mix of architecture befitting of a city that was once capital of Kievan Rus, the precursor of the modern Russian state. A wealth of baroque and Renaissance architecture can also be found in Lviv, one of Europe's oldest cities, while Odessa is probably best known for the Potemkin Stairway that featured in Sergei Eisenstein's epic film The Battleship Potemkin.  Recently, Ukraine has been in the news for the wrong reasons due to Russian separatism on the border. Despite this, most of the country is completely safe for visitors.","Ukraine  Attractions in Ukraine  Carpathian Mountains  Ski or snowboard in the Carpathian Mountains in the west. The leading resorts are Bukovel, Slavsko, Drahobrat and Tysovets. Bukovel is the only resort of international standard, although Drahobrat has the most reliable snow.  Caves Monastery  Explore Kiev's religious heritage at the Caves Monastery. This ancient institution is the focal point of the early Orthodox Church. You'll need to carry candles to see the church relics, which are set in a maze of spooky catacombs.  Chernobyl  Take a macabre guided tour to Chernobyl, scene of the world's worst ever nuclear disaster, just a day trip from Kiev. It's safe to visit for short periods and doubtless one of the more unique Ukrainian experiences.  Kamyanets-Podilsky  Marvel at the stunning Western Ukrainian town of Kamyanets-Podilsky, a medieval stunner set on a tall rock outcrop that has beguiled travellers for centuries and was famously described as 'a stone flower on the rock' by poet Lesya Ukrayinka.  Kiev  Discover Kiev, both the ancient cradle of Russian civilisation and the city from which the Orthodox faith spread throughout Eastern Europe. The extraordinary Golden Gate of Kiev is the last remnant of the 10th-century walls built to defend the city. Take part in the Kiev Days celebrations, held annually during the last weekend of May. Events include performances by actors and musicians, as well as fireworks displays. Lviv  Discover gorgeous Lviv, an open-air museum of extraordinary architectural wealth. The Old Town, a UNESCO World Heritage site, is centered on the glorious Market Square, stuffed full of dazzling gothic, baroque, Renaissance and rococo buildings. For a dazzing evening, see a theatre or operatic performance at The Ivan Franko Opera House: an extravagantly built, richly decorated structure, classed among the best theatres in Europe.  Mystetskyi Arsenal  Once an abandoned military arsenal building in the middle of the city, Mystetskyi Arsenal has been transformed into Kiev's premier arts and cultural space. At over 53,000 sq m, it is one of the largest museums in Europe, housing art laboratories, libraries and classrooms as well as exhibition space.  Odessa  Relive the world's most famous cinema scene in Odessa, the site of the famous Potemkin Stairway from Sergei Eisenstein's film, Battleship Potemkin. Odessa is the country's most cosmopolitan city, with a thriving Jewish population and boundless confidence.  River swimming  Join the locals who swim in summer in the Dnieper River in Kiev and climb onto its ice in winter to fish. Even better, come here for Orthodox Epiphany and be splashed with icy water during the celebrations.  Sevastopol  Explore the fascinating catacombs of Sevastopol (www.sevdig.sevastopol.ws), for over two centuries the secret naval headquarters on the Black Sea. Discover the extraordinary underground submarine base and be James Bond for the day.  St Sofia Cathedral  See the 11th-century St Sofia Cathedral, which contains splendid icons and frescoes and is situated in beautiful grounds. The Cathedral of St Vladimir is the headquarters of the rival pro-Ukrainian church.  Wine tasting  The region's vineyards produce good-quality wine which can be tasted locally quite cheaply. The Wine Tasting Hall in Yalta is as good a place as any.  Yalta  Make a trip south to Yalta, the 'Pearl of the Crimea'. Nearby is the Livadia Palace, where Roosevelt, Churchill and Stalin met in 1945 to reshape the map of Europe, and where the tsars spent their summer holidays before the Bolshevik Revolution.",europe,,
south sudan,"There’s off-piste, and then there’s South Sudan. Officially the world’s newest nation, its poor infrastructure and volatile political climate will deter most from visiting this fledgling nation. But the intrepid few who do visit will discover some of the least known and most extreme natural phenomena on Earth.      After a messy divorce from Sudan in 2011, the South Sudanese people are fiercely proud of their hard-fought independence and both surprised and pleased when someone choses to visit.      Somewhat chaotic, and growing rapidly, the capital, Juba, has a superb location on the banks of the White Nile. Founded in the 1920s, it exhibits some excellent examples of British colonial architecture around the Hai Jalaba district, though most visitors will want to leave man-made structures behind and head for the country’s natural wonders.      The vast swampy Sudd region, known locally as Bahr el Jebel or “Mountain Sea” is where the Nile forms one of the world’s largest inland wetlands. A habitat safe from poachers for large populations of hippos, it is a unique experience to explore its vast islands of reeds by canoe.      Boma National Park not only boasts large populations of Africa’s most iconic wildlife species, including elephant, giraffe and lion, but also the greatest migration of mammals on Earth, when an estimated two million grazing animals flee en mass for pastures new. The region is also renowned for its traditional tribal homesteads, which dot the plains.      Not content with rivers, swamps and savannah, South Sudan’s natural prowess extends to the Imatong Mountains, and the star attraction here is Kinyeti, the highest mountain in the country at 3,200m (10,500ft).      The South Sudanese consider their homeland blessed and it’s hard to disagree when you see the sheer diversity of natural landscapes the country has to offer. Road travel can be uncomfortable, but the end result is certainly well worth any hardship.","South Sudan  Attractions in South Sudan  Attend a wrestling match  Perhaps the most popular sport in the country, wrestling competitions are major events. Renowned wrestlers covered in dust do battle in stadiums complete with floodlights. Large crowds shout support over blaring music and beating drums. Watch – or have a go yourself – and understand why the sport elicits such frenzied admiration. The town of Bor hosts events every weekend.  Experience old and new in Wau  South Sudan's second city, Wau is home to a plethora of colonial-era buildings and a mix of tribes that give the city a cosmopolitan air. Its domed 1913 cathedral is the largest in the region, while Wau is also the terminus of the country's only rail line, snaking its way slowly north to Babanosa in Sudan.  Explore the Sudd by canoe  A vast inland sea formed by the Nile, the impenetrable nature of the Sudd's tangled vegetation has made it a fantastic place to witness a wetland habitat undisturbed by the modern world. For a magical journey take a canoe out onto the water and paddle amongst the hippos that live there.  Go on safari  Nimule National Park is the country's most accessible. Visitors can hire a boat to Opekoloe Island for the best sightings of elephant, before heading out to Fola Falls with a an expert ranger. Here you can not only witness the impressive spectacle of the cascading water, but also watch fishermen cast out their nets under the watchful gaze of crocs and hippos.  Hike through the Imatong Mountains  Still in its infancy, like South Sudan itself, there is a burgeoning hiking scene in the forests of the Imatong Mountains, whose peaks offer spectacular views over the plains into Uganda. With luck, you'll be able to catch sight of elephant and leopard too.  Kick back in the capital, Juba  The world's newest capital city is the place to visit if you want ringside tickets for the spectacle that is nation building. Juba is a fast-growing boomtown, with new buildings being thrown up on a weekly basis. Of the sites to visit the most important is the memorial to John Garang, who led the Sudan People's Liberation Army for over 20 years.  Observe an unchanged way of life at a cattle camp  The majority of the Dinka tribe remain nomadic farmers, so their cattle camps offer a fascinating view into a traditional way of life and show the importance of cattle to the tribespeople. Boys live alongside herds of more than 500 long-horned cattle in the camps, which are generally situated around Bor.  Sip a sundowner on the Nile  With 90% of South Sudan sitting in the White Nile basin, including the capital, Juba, the Nile plays a significant part in everyday life. Head to one of the capital's many restaurants or bars for views of the longest river in the world as the sun sets in a magnificent display of colour.  Walk through history in Fashoda  A closed city for almost 500 years, due to its sacred connections for the kings of Shilluk, Fashoda, now rechristened Kodok, is also famously the site where France and Britain almost come to blows over control of the region in the 19th century.  Witness the world’s largest animal migration  Forget Serengeti's wildebeest migration – for the world's largest mammal migration head to Boma National Park. This protected area is home to millions of white-eared kob and tiang antelope, which thunder across South Sudan every October. This great spectacle has endured many wars, though threats from conflict remain. As well as antelope, the park is home to lions, elephants, giraffe and cheetah, to name a few.",africa,,
barbados,"Fringed by white sandy beaches, sapphire seas and colourful coral reefs, Barbados is the archetypal Caribbean retreat. Off the beaten path this is not: Simon Cowell, Wayne Rooney and Will Smith are amongst the many celebs that have popularised the island, which, alas, has the a-list prices to match.      First time visitors can be forgiven for heading straight for the sand. Barbados is endowed with 113km (70 miles) of glorious beaches, which range from calm coves to surf-pounded shorelines. Most tourists flock to the Platinum Coast to the west, which is lined with luxury resorts, spa hotels, sophisticated restaurants and manicured golf courses, all lapped by the limpid Caribbean Sea.      Never played golf? Not a fan of high-end resorts? Then fear not. The altogether quieter south coast has some of the island’s best beaches, while the east coast, pummelled by the Atlantic Ocean, is less developed and attracts mainly surfers, who quench their thirsts in local rum shacks.      Although Barbados’s interior is unremarkable compared to some of its Caribbean neighbours there is much to see. And the best way to see it is by hiring a motorbike or a jeep and taking to the road, calling at crumbling sugar mills, rum distilleries and traditional churches that look like they’ve been lifted from England. Finish up in the colonial capital, Bridgetown, which, along with the nearby garrison, was awarded World Heritage Site status in 2012.      Combine these attractions with the island’s indelible laid-back vibe, its passion for rum (over 1,500 rum shops dot the island) and calypso-infused festivals, and it’s no wonder people return to Barbados time and time again.","Barbados  Attractions in Barbados  Admire the colonial architecture  The Jacobean St Nicholas Abbey is graced with ornate Persian arches and well-kept gardens. Although now in ruins, Farley Hill is still covered in hibiscus and poinsettias and is one of the island's most storied plantation houses. The George Washington House and Museum is a beautifully restored plantation house, where the former US president stayed on a brief visit to Barbados in 1751.  Admire the local architecture  Tyrol Cot, the grand former home of Sir Grantley Adams, the first premier of Barbados, is a stunning example of local architectural styles. Constructed in 1854, this architectural gem offers an interesting mixture of Palladian and tropical vernacular – beautifully restored by the Barbados National Trust.  Bask on Crane Beach  The baby-pink sands of cliff-flanked Crane Beach, an idyllic spot that is one of the most beautiful on the island, are perfect for a stroll or some sunbathing. Moderate, foamy waves draw a body-surfing crowd and there are plenty of shaded spots to chill out until the magical sunsets arrive.  Breeze around Bridgetown  The Barbados capital, Bridgetown, is the best place to enjoy the island’s colonial history. Visit National Heroes Square, which boasts a statue of Lord Nelson, erected in 1813, well before Nelson's Column was put up in London. Nearby are the neo-Gothic Parliament Buildings, Bridgetown Synagogue (reputed to the oldest in the western hemisphere) and the pretty, pink pastel coloured facades of DaCosta’s Mall. When you tire of sightseeing, pop into one of the ubiquitous rum shops or head for a drink at the Waterfront area overlooking the marina.  Discover shipwrecks in Carlisle Bay  Barbados has several excellent sites for wreck diving. Arguably the most famous is Carlisle Bay, which has more than 200 reported wrecks, and the Stavronikita, a Greek freighter which rests in 37m (120ft) of water, less than 1.6 km (1 mile) from the shore at Folkestone Marine Park.  Explore Harrison’s Cave  With an abundance of stalactites, stalagmites, streams, lakes and waterfalls, Harrison's Cave is a jaw-dropping spectacle. The caves were first mentioned in historical documents in 1795 and then virtually forgotten for nearly 200 years, until being rediscovered in 1976. Visitors can explore the caves on a 40-minute guided tour in an electric cart. Self-guided walks are also possible.  Get close to nature in Welchman Hall Gully's  You can also take a self-guided hike amid rare fruit trees in Welchman Hall Gully's magnificent botanic garden or in Andromeda Gardens. Another highlight is the Flower Forest, a vast leafy garden rich in native plants. The Barbados National Trust offers free, guided hikes which are divided into three categories: stop'n'stare, where'n'there and grin'n'bear. Moonlit walks are also held.  Get wet  The island's rugged south and west coasts boast world-class watersports where windsurfers, jet skiers, parasailers and water skiers enjoy perfect conditions. To ride the waves head to the Soup Bowl, South Point and Rockley Beach, which are Barbados' best surfing spots.  Go scuba-diving  While there are less pelagic fish off Barbados because of unregulated fishing, divers can enjoy a range of other marine life including sea horses, frogfish and giant sand eels. Hidden caves and shipwrecks provide plenty of underwater nooks and crannies along a shoreline nested by hawksbill turtles.  Go wildlife watching in Barbados Wildlife Reserve  The Barbados Wildlife Reserve's resplendent mahogany forest is the roaming territory of green monkeys, tortoises, deer, raccoons, pelicans and otters. A walk-through aviary allows a leafy stroll with peacocks, turkeys, toucans, parrots, flamingos, pelicans, lovebirds and macaws.  Peruse the wares at Chalky Mount Potteries  Barbados' famous Chalky Mount potters are renowned for their high quality inexpensive art. You can watch the local potters at work at the wheel fashioning centuries-old designs, which is a respected 300-year-old tradition. Buy some of their wares to support the potters' time-honoured profession.  Saddle up and go for a gallop  Horse riding is a popular activity in Barbados. It's possible to gallop along the beach at sundown or simply trek along inland trails. Dozens of horse-riding events take place on the Garrison Savannah. Polo is also played to a high level by fiercely competitive Barbadian teams.  Take in the views  Lofty Mount Hillaby, the island's highest point at 343m (1,125ft), offers incredible panoramas across the east, west and northern coasts. Dramatic vistas also abound from St John's Parish Church over miles of jagged coastline and moss-covered family vaults dotted with tropical flora.  Take the East Coast Road  Barbados's East Coast Road, hemmed by crashing Atlantic waves, is one of the island's most exciting drives. A rugged coastal route overlooks treacherous reefs while an inland road weaves through rolling sugarcane to quaint plantation towns topped by church steeples.  Taste the oldest rum in the world  Mount Gay Rum, on the island's west coast, can trace its heritage back to 1703, making it the world's oldest rum producer. Made from the sugar cane that thrived across the island, it was once the favoured tipple of English sailors. Visitors can learn about the refining, aging, blending and bottling process on tastings and tours, which run hourly between Monday-Saturday.  Visit Morgan Lewis Mill  The aged and charming Morgan Lewis Mill is one of only two of the Caribbean's intact sugar mills, and a noteworthy example of a Dutch windmill from the days of the sugar cane planters. The mill includes an exhibit of the equipment used to produce sugar. Although the old plantation house has seen better days, its crumbling exteriors are very evocative and an important legacy of the island's history.  Watch a game of cricket  Cricket is the national sporting obsession. There’s always a game going on somewhere. Choose from barefoot village friendlies to international and local club cups where many of the great names of West Indian cricket are honoured, most notably Sir Garfield Sobers.  Whizz through the rainforest at Walkes Spring  Aerial Trek Zipline Adventures offers soft adventure thrills as you whizz through the rainforest at Jack-in-the-box Gully, Walkes Spring, in the centre of the island. The scenic ride began operations in 2007 and is proving popular. Advance bookings are recommended.",caribbean,,
solomon islands,"The Solomon Islands archipelago is made up of nearly 1,000 tropical islands scattered across the southwestern Pacific, just to the east of Papua New Guinea. The remote location has kept the islands an unspoilt gem of a travel destination, with a slowly developing tourist industry.  The main islands to visit are Guadalcanal, Malaita, Choiseul, New Georgia, San Cristobal and Santa Isabel. The capital of Honiara, on Guadalcanal, is also well worth some time, with a museum, botanical gardens and its very own Chinatown. Villages and scenic drives are within easy reach of the capital, as are the popular World War II battlefield tours and carving villages on the islands of Rennell and Bellona.  Many Pacific islands are well geared to tourism today, but Solomon Islands bucks the trend, with a few shambolic guesthouses to stay in and a thoroughly laid-back approach to life. No palatial resorts here. The locals pride themselves in preserving the natural beauty of the islands.  Wander the jungle-strewn landscapes and take pleasure in stumbling across leaf-hut villages. Indeed, the traditional culture of the islanders endures to this day. Some 70 languages are spoken among the half a million largely Melanesian inhabitants, the majority of whom are Christian, though they also cling to their ancient customs. Many still wear traditional indigenous clothing, while the pan flute can be heard everywhere.  On the natural side, there are volcanic islands to explore, vast lagoons, spell-binging rainforests and countless tropical islands. Be sure to tour the mangrove forests, but beware of crocodiles. More active visitors can go surfing and kayaking, while the well-kept coral reefs offer ample opportunity for snorkelling. Guided tours into the yawning chasm of an extinct volcano is another unmissable, as are dives down to shipwrecks from World War II.  The Solomon Islands may not be that well known compared to other regional destinations, but this makes them all the more enticing for the adventurous traveller.","Solomon Islands  Attractions in Solomon Islands  Experience island life  Culturally speaking the Solomon Islands are fascinating. Though bound together by their shared maritime heritage, the various societies living on the archipelago differ wildly from island to island. As well as a taste of local life, a visit to the main islands of Choiseul, Guadalcanal, Malaita, New Georgia, San Cristobal and Santa Isabel offers a peek at the Solomon Islands’ colonial history.   Explore the wildlife  Pack your binoculars because wildlife abounds on the Solomon Islands. Go in search of a range of reptiles (including turtles), as well as marsupials such as flying foxes (fruit bats), phalangers and opossums. The birdlife is also excellent.  Grab a rod and go fishing  Try a spot of fishing in the Solomon Islands' well-stocked waters. Enquiries may be made at the Point Cruz Yacht Club, which welcomes visitors. The bountiful waters surround the Solomons have well over 700 species of fish that include big game such as sailfish and marlin.  Head to Honiara  Honiara, the capital city, is a fine place to while away a day or two. It has a pleasant museum, botanical gardens and Chinatown, and its strewn with relics from WWII. Notice boards indicate major battles and incidents that took place during the battle for Guadalcanal. Villages and scenic drives are within easy reach.  Sample the local culture in Guadalcanal  Go on an excursion around Guadalcanal and other islands. Popular tours include the battlefields of WWII, the Betikama carving centre, and Alite and Laulasi villages on the island of Malaita, where shells are broken, rounded and, after further working, strung together. The strings of shells can be worn as bracelets, necklaces, belts and earrings.  Take part in sports  A variety of sports are enjoyed on the Solomon Islands including rugby union and football. There is a national team for both sports. Other popular sports include futsal and beach football, which the Solomon Islands have excelled at in international competition level.  Take the plunge and go diving  Much of the best land-based diving located in the Western Province on or near the islands of Gizo and New Georgia. Well-known dive sites in the area include Munda, on the Roviana Lagoon, 15 minutes by plane from Gizo; and Uepi Island, on the north side of New Georgia, across the famous Marovo Lagoon. Diving tours to the numerous WWII wrecks are also possible.  Venture into the tropical rainforests  Tour the tropical rainforests that cover most of the archipelago and scale its verdant volcanoes. Exotic orchids, ferns and palms are widespread and butterflies are abundant. Got a fancy for reptiles? You're in luck because there are more than 70 species in the jungle, as well as fruit bats.",oceania,,

It’s also one of the largest countries on the planet, with an awesome array of treasures to match. Its vast coastline is fringed with soft sands and island getaways; the Amazon Basin teems with an unrivalled mass of flora and fauna; and the wetlands of the Pantanal, the largest on Earth, support a staggering diversity of wildlife.      And then there’s the Iguaçu Falls, an unforgettable natural spectacle featuring hundreds of waterfalls, which cascade from the tropical rainforest as blue morpho butterflies flit through the spray.      Undoubtedly the greatest draw, however, are the Brazilians themselves; probably the most hedonistic people on earth. Whether it’s Rio’s effervescent Cariocas going overboard at Carnival, or São Paulo’s sultry citizens gyrating in chic nightclubs, Brazilians love having fun.      Their irrepressible joie de vivre finds its best outlet through music and dance. Samba, lambada and bossa nova are Brazil’s best-known musical exports, but visitors can also discover a plethora of other genres, from the Northeast’s forró to the punchy bass of baile funk coming out of Rio’s favelas.      Adrenaline junkies can go wild in Brazil; shooting the big surf of Santa Catarina; bouncing in beach buggies over the sand dunes of northern Natal; snorkeling in Fernando de Noronha National Park; or abseiling in the Chapada Diamantina National Park.

Whatever you’re looking for, rest assured, Brazil has it in spades.","Brazil  Attractions in Brazil  Be dazzled by the precious gems of Minas Gerais  Discover some of Brazil's best-preserved colonial architecture in Minas Gerais, a region of southern Brazil, which became fabulously rich following the discovery of gold and diamonds in the 17th century. Ouro Preto, Mariana, Sabará and Diamantina are particular gems, with ornate Baroque churches and colonial mansions filled with religious art and sculpture.  Browse the romantic backstreets of Paraty  Paraty is a delightful, historic town on the Costa Verde between Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, which grew rich on the 18th-century gold trade. Its wealth is reflected today in the beautifully preserved colonial buildings such as Santa Rita Church, built by freed slaves. Paraty is a popular destination for schooner cruises around its bay and islands, and is well stocked with boutique hotels and gourmet restaurants.  Costa Verde islands and beaches  There are literally thousands of gorgeous islands and beaches along Brazil's coastline, including the chic resort of Búzios, and car-free Morro de São Paulo in Bahia. Tropical islands are liberally sprinkled off the Costa Verde between Rio and São Paulo; among the most idyllic are Ilha Grande and Ilhabela.

Or you can explore some magnificent colonial treasures dating from the city's rubber boom era, including the Teatro Amazonas opera house and the art nouveau dockside market.  Explore the Amazon  Floating through the rainforest on an Amazonian ferry is one of the great travel experiences. The world's largest rainforest is fed by 10 of the world's 20 largest rivers, including the Amazon itself, which is the biggest river system on the planet. The usual base for trips is Manaus, but try Santarem for a lesser-known alternative.  Explore the blissful beaches of the North  Bounce around the sand dunes of northern Brazil in a beach buggy. From the coastal resort city of Fortaleza, it's a four-hour drive to Jericoacoara, a picturesque village set between a dazzling white desert and a balmy turquoise sea. Ceará state has some of the best beaches in Brazil, with excellent conditions for watersports.  Explore the historic missions of Rio Grande do Sul  Visit the redbrick ruins of 300-year-old Saõ Miguel das Missões, the only survivor of the once 30 Jesuit missions in southern Brazil, which formed an important role, defending the indigenous Guaraní people against colonial slavery. The building is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and, despite the ravages of time and neglect, is well worth seeing for its stylised Baroque architecture and historical interest.  Get the vibes of Salvador da Bahia  Explore colourful Salvador da Bahia, capital of the northeastern coastal state of Bahia. This UNESCO World Heritage Site boasts dozens of colonial-era buildings clustered around the cobblestone streets of Pelourinho. Salvador is one of Brazil's most culturally vibrant cities, spawning some of its best-known musicians, artists and writers, and hosting one of the best Carnivals in the country.  Go diving off Fernando de Noronha  The deep blue waters of coastal Brazil are superb for diving, particularly in the north, where the sea is usually warmer and clearer. The protected marine park on the island of Fernando de Noronha has probably the best diving; also the Abrolhos Archipelago, off the coast of Bahia. Southern Brazil also has some excellent dive spots, including Arraial do Cabo, Ubatuba, and Laje de Santos.  Go hang gliding over Rio  Soar above the tropical landscape on a tandem hang-gliding flight from Pedra Bonita in Rio's Tijuca National Park.

See a football match at the Maracanã  Watch the belojogo (beautiful game) in Rio's world-famous Maracanã Stadium. With fans dancing, singing and pounding drums amid clouds of coloured smoke, the carnival atmosphere on the terraces sometimes overshadows the game itself. Football is a national obsession and matches are passionately noisy affairs.  Soak up the spray of mighty Iguaçu Falls  Set amid rainforest teeming with butterflies, birds and many other animals, these majestic waterfalls in southern Brazil are one of the great wonders of the Americas, with 275 individual falls encompassing a vast area protected by two national parks (one in neighbouring Argentina). The highest fall, the Garganta do Diabo (Devil's Throat) reaches 70m (230ft), which is one and a half times the height of Niagara Falls.  Wildlife watch in the Pantanal  This spectacularly rich ecosystem in west-central Brazil is home to big cats, reptiles and hundreds of exotic birds. The Pantanal's vast wetlands have wide-open savannah, which, unlike the Amazon's dense rainforests, allow easy viewing of their abundant wildlife. The dry season (April-October) is the best time to visit, when animals cluster around the waterholes and the birds are breeding.  Wonder at Brazil’s stunning capital, Brasília  Often overlooked by visitors, Brasília is an architectural showpiece, of curvaceous modern buildings dominating the Planalto's flat horizons.

eswatini,,"Eswatini (Swaziland)  Attractions in Eswatini (Swaziland)  Ezulwini Valley  Also known as “The Valley of Heaven”, the Ezulwini Valley boasts lush and magnificent countryside - some of the finest that southern Africa has to offer. Neighbouring Malkerns Valley is equally fertile and verdant, and is well known for its scenic drive.  Hot mineral springs  The aptly named Cuddle Puddle is one of the many hot mineral springs that can be found throughout Eswatini (Swaziland).

During the Incwala, the king gives his people permission to eat the first crops of the season (December/January), while the spectacular Umhlanga (Reed Dance) sees maidens present reeds to the Queen Mother and takes place in August/September.      Lobamba is also home to The National Museum, Somhlolo National Stadium and King Sobhuza II Memorial Park – all are much visited tourist attractions.

pennsylvania,"Energetic cities, gorgeous rural landscapes, world-class culture and history by the bucketload: Pennsylvania will leave you breathless. You can dip into 18th-century life at historic homesteads, trace the state’s industrial heritage in old mining villages and disused ironworks, and plant your feet on legendary battlefields.      Philadelphia, its largest city, takes pride in its history. It was here that the country's Founding Fathers signed the Declaration of Independence, and for many visitors, the first port of call is Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell.

louisiana,"A former Spanish and French colony, the southern US state of Louisiana is filled with rolling hills and scented pine forests, multicultural cities and murky swamps teeming with alligators.

monaco,"From the multi-million pound yachts glinting in Monte Carlo harbour, to the endless flow of golden champagne, Monaco oozes privilege. Celebrities flock to this Mediterranean members-only club, with its opulent lifestyle, discreet banking facilities and heavily policed streets.  There's more to this 200-hectare principality than meets the eye, though, with some terrific restaurants and an interesting history that continues to beguile to this day. In this, the second smallest country after the Vatican, natives still speak the Monégasque dialect, which sits somewhere between French and Italian. Meanwhile, Monaco's citizens famously don't have to pay taxes, which has partly made it an attractive place to live for some of the world's richest people.  For visitors wishing to bask in some Monaco glitz, there are big annual events such as the Tennis Masters Series in April and the Formula 1 Grand Prix in May. Other festivals include the Monaco International Non Violent Film Festival, the Monte Carlo Opera and the annual Spring Arts Festival.  In Monaco, you can expect plenty of luxury hotel towers, glamorous nightclubs and grand casinos. The latter attraction is tied up with the modern fate of Monaco. The tiny country's history of gambling dates back to the 1850s when the head of state commissioned the building of a casino to provide him with income, without having to increase taxes on his citizens. At first, the casino remained bizarrely empty, until a railroad connected Monaco with the rest of the world. It was soon doing so well that the principality was able to do away with taxes altogether. Overnight, Monaco became popular for Europe's most hedonistic elites, who came for the ever-flowing champagne and renowned opera productions.  Away from the glamour, Monaco's balmy climate and seaside location make it a naturally beautiful place to visit. You can enjoy scenic walking routes along pretty costal bays, and stop for a drink at many al fresco cafés. For those with a couple of days to spare, Provence, the French Riviera and Italy are all within easy reach.","Monaco  Attractions in Monaco  Azur Express Tourist Train  In Monaco-Ville (the Old Town), hop on the Azur Express Tourist Train, which offers commentaries in French, Italian, German and English.

If you're curious to see what 'real' people living in Monaco do for fun, this is it - the millionaires have their private beaches.  Fontvieille  Discover more than 180 varieties of rose at the Princess Grace Rose Garden. The Museum of Stamps and Coins features rare philatelic items from the postal history of the Principality. The permanent exhibition of Prince Rainier III's Private Collection of Classic Cars, with over 100 classic cars, is nearby. The Naval Museum and the Zoological Terraces are also located here.  Gamble  Gamble in style at the Grand Casino in Monte Carlo. The casino is located in Monaco's most exclusive quartier, where all the most luxurious and fashionable hotels, restaurants and boutiques can also be found (including the famous Hôtel de Paris). The building's style is distinctively grand and luxurious and the casino is linked to the Salle Garnier Opera House by an impressive atrium lined with 28 Ionic Golden Circle columns made of onyx. The minimum age for entering any of Monte Carlo's casinos is 21. You will need your passport at the door as well as an entry fee of â¬10.  Gardens  Chill out at the serene and sea-facing Saint-Martin Gardens (also in the Old Town), which inspired the poet Guillaume Apollinaire between 1887 and 1889. Alternatively, visit the Japanese Gardens, right next to the sea.  Monaco Cathedral  Consecrated in 1875, Saint Nicholas Cathedral is a special place for Monegasques. It was where Princess Grace married Prince Rainier as well as where they have both been buried. The Grimaldi family have buried their family here for centuries and the tombs are beautiful. MuseumsThe Oceanographic Museum and Aquarium, whose grandiose facade rises spectacularly out of the sea, houses a world-renowned collection of marine fauna and interactive exhibits. Other museums include the Museum of Napoleonic Souvenirs and Collection of the Palace's Historic Archives, which exhibits thousands of objects relating to the First Empire (Napoleon I); the Wax Museum of the Princes of Monaco; and the Monte Carlo Story, a multivision show about Monaco's history.

nigeria,"From the loud laughter of traffic-choked Lagos to the green-fringed villages that line rivers and streams, Nigeria is one of the most exciting places to visit in Africa.      Once known only for oil and chaos, the country is changing rapidly. It has a rising middle class, a dynamic arts scene and more miles of golden sand than you can shake a bucket and spade at. Its national parks are home to some of the last remaining endangered species in West Africa, while its mountains offer a cooler climate and spectacular views of the most populous country in Africa.      Those 177 million people are as diverse as the nation itself; in the north, you'll see men in colourful Muslim dress lining prayer mats on Fridays, while their southern counterparts play checkers before church. The cuisine too is varied; there are hot and spicy dishes, fresh fish and meat, fast food and imported fare.      But Nigeria's greatest asset – its wealth of native races and religions, its vibrant population – have also proven its downfall on countless explosive occasions, and military overthrows, coups and assassinations have been numerous. The situation is particularly fraught in northern Nigeria, which is home to the jihadist group, Boko Haram (meaning “Western education is forbidden”).      For all its domestic difficulties, Nigeria remains a major regional power and lays claim to the biggest economy in Africa – if you want to feel the excitement of an emerging country, this land will blow you away.      It’s full of surprises, too. Visitors can find themselves dancing the night away at a Nigerian wedding party, sipping champagne with supermodels, haggling for art in Lagos’ hipster district, Yabi, and swimming beneath cascading waterfalls in the mountains.      Though Nigeria is a loud and brash destination, it also has a quieter, more reflective side that deserves to be seen. In fact it has so many faces that at times it feels more like a continent than a country.","Nigeria  Attractions in Nigeria  Admire the art deco at Ibadan  Pleasant Ibadan is worth a visit for its adventurous architecture; there are colonial buildings, art deco gems and buildings emblazoned with traditional Nigerian emblems. The city itself (Nigeria's third largest, after Lagos and Kano) has a large university and vibrant student nightlife.  Appreciate the bygone beauty of Emir's Palace  Circumnavigate the walled old town of Kano, formerly the largest of the ancient Hausa cities, and soak up its lingering medieval atmosphere. Founded at least 1,000 years ago, it was of strategic importance on the trans-Saharan trade routes. Visit the Emir's Palace, which remains an outstanding example of Hausa architecture, and pop by the glorious Gidan Makama Museum. Security an issue in Kano these days, so heed the latest travel advice.  Bring out the binoculars for Gashaka Game Reserve  Nigeria's most scenic national park, the Gashaka Game Reserve near Yola provides opportunities to view over 500 species of birds. As well as being home to some highly endangered species, including the rare Adamawa mountain reedbuck, the park features large African elephant and giant eland.  Cool down in Calabar  Calabar is a pleasant town in a beautiful setting, high on a hill above the Calabar River. It has a Mediterranean feel, with its whitewashed houses, clean(ish) streets and slightly cool climate. Don't miss the giant cast iron hand sculptures in the park outside the slave museum; shacked but cut at the wrist, they represent breaking free from the past.  Discover ancient Ile-Ife  Ile-Ife, the ancient name of the town of Ife, is another recess of Yoruba culture, and includes the Ife Museum, which has many fine bronze and terracotta sculptures dating back to the 13th century. Traditional Yoruba rulers are known as Oònis, visit the palace to see the Yemolu Well, from which only the incumbent can drink.  Explore the brilliant, bustling Benin City  Modern Benin City is a rapidly developing metropolis, but there are a few reminders of its long Yoruba history. The old city's moat and wall survive in places, and the National Museum houses an interesting collection of Benin royal art. The Oba's Palace is worth visiting, although permission needs to be obtained in Lagos.  Hike up Shere Hills for fantastic views  The Shere Hills offer some of the West Africa's best hiking. Lace up your boots and trail up towards the high peaks of about 1,800m (5,900ft). Not all of the routes are marked, and you may want to take a guide with you in case you lose your way. The views are spectacular.  Pack a picnic and head for Jos  Picnic without breaking a sweat in Jos, a favourite holiday spot on account of its location 1,200m (3,900ft) above sea level, meaning it has a pleasantly cool climate. The nearby Assob Falls and the many streams and dams that come from them, make this an extremely pretty area.  Scale the seven Olumirin Falls  Local legend has it that the seven Olumirin Falls descend from a huge pot of water at the top of the cliff. Indeed, these falls close to Akure are supposedly bestowed with all kinds of magical powers. They also represent a feat of strength, for travellers fit and cautious enough to climb to the top, the views are magnificent.  See ancient monoliths in Cross River National Park  Journey through the Cross River National Park from the town of Ikom, which has curious carved monoliths set in circles, believed to be ancient monuments assembled in reverence to ancestors. In the Rainforest Conservation area, you'll find majestic mountains and rolling hills, with wildlife including leopards, buffalos, chimpanzees, gorillas, baboons and elephants.  Seek out the Palace of the Emir of Zazzau  If security conditions allow access to the north, Zaria's old city is unmissable. Far more enjoyable to stroll around than Kano, there are a number of beautiful old buildings, not least the Palace of the Emir of Zazzau. The gate of the palace is a colourful mosaic whilst sandstone walls, adobe mud compounds and mosques line the ancient streets nearby.  Swim beneath the Gurara Falls  Niger state's Gurara Falls, at a height of about 20m (66ft), are well off the beaten track, and that's part of what makes them such a special place to visit. Unlike other big waterfalls in Africa, you won't have to compete with hordes of tourists, and can swim in the small pools at the bottom of the cascading falls.   Uncover Nigeria's ancient past at the National Museum in Lagos  The National Museum at Onikan on Lagos Island houses numerous exhibits of Nigeria's ancient civilisations and has a craft centre, which sells examples of Nigerian craft at fixed prices. There's a nice collection of Nigerian art inside the exhibition halls. Cameras are not allowed inside.  Visit the sacred shrine of Osogbo  Worship the Yoruba goddess of fertility in Osogbo, home to the famous Osun Shrine and sacred grove of Oshun. Every year, towards the end of August as the rainy season finishes, thousands of childless women head to the Osun Festival to seek the help of the Yoruba goddess of fertility.  Watch wildlife and unwind in warm springs, Yankari National Park  Yankari National Park, in the east of the country, is a particularly good spot for bird-watching. Animals that can be viewed here include elephants, crocodiles and monkeys.

Although Tajikistan is one of the most remote countries in the world, even its most inaccessible nooks host life; the mountains and deserts are home to Kyrgyz nomads, who eke out simple, self-sufficient lives as they have done for generations. Intrepid travellers will endure some of the coldest temperatures on the planet to visit them, but these chilly conditions are tempered by the Kyrgyz’s warm hospitality.      An independent state since 1991, Tajikistan spent much of the last two centuries under Tsarist and Soviet rule. Ethnic Tajiks form the majority of the population, but there are also minority ethnic groups of Russian, Uzbek and Kyrgyz origin – a mix brought about by Stalin’s “divide and conquer” strategy.      Tajikistan’s landscapes are just as dramatic as its political history. In the mountainous west, lofty peaks plunge into deep valleys where villages cling precariously to the cliffs-side above fast flowing rivers. In these settlements, where most of the population are subsidence farmers, any available patch of land is terraced and cultivated with potatoes, cabbage and wheat.      Over in the east, the mountains plateau into a vast, high-altitude desert that looks like the surface of the moon. This is a hostile part of the world, as Marco Polo noted when he travelled through the region. “No birds fly here because of the height and the cold,” he wrote.      Most arrive in Tajikistan via its capital, Dushanbe, one of the prettier cities in Central Asia with its gilded palaces, leafy parks and neoclassical facades. Emerging from the shadows of Soviet rule, Dushanbe is desperate to impress; it boasts the largest teahouse and tallest flagpole in the world, which are, aside from a few museums and markets, about the extent of its attractions.      But Tajikistan isn’t about the destination, it’s about the journey; a journey through history and geography, where warm a welcome awaits those intrepid enough to visit.","Tajikistan  Attractions in Tajikistan  Amble around leafy Dushanbe  There is a genteel ambiance along the boulevards of Dushanbe that is more akin to a French town than a Soviet era city. Yes, ugly concrete tenements can be found in the suburbs, but the city centre is home to a pretty collection of neo-classical buildings and leafy parks, which offer vistas of snow-capped mountains.  Call in at the National Museum of Antiques  Although not the prettiest of buildings, the Museum of National Antiquities (www.afcryukoku.ac.jp) has an excellent collection of archaeology exhibits. However, the highlight of any visit is the huge statue of a sleeping Buddha, which was excavated in 1966 and then relocated to the museum. Also on offer are several artefacts of Sogdian and Persian origin.  Check out ancient cave art  Located some 40km (25 miles) south of Murghab is the most important archaeological site in Tajikistan, Shakhty Cave. Its walls are adorned with decorative cave paintings dating back to 6500BC, depicting life in the Neolithic period. To find the cave, contact the Murghab Ecotourism Association, 102 Osh Street, Murghab (www.meta.tj).  Disapprove of Dushanbe’s ‘dictator chic’  The new 'Dictator chic' buildings in the city centre are outrageously opulent; visitors can only wonder how the government can justify building the highest flagpole in the world, the largest chaihana in the world and the glittering Palace of Nations when most of its rural population are without running water or a reliable quality of electricity supply. These edifices serve only to impress the tourist and are testament to the remarkable tolerance of the Tajik people.  Discover the natural beauty of Rangkul  To the north and east of Murghab lies the lake and village of Rangkul. The lake is particularly beautiful because of the shades of rock on the opposite shore and the lake is also an important transit location for bird migration. Rangkul village has a deep Kyrgyz heritage and tourists can pre-arrange through META a cultural performance of dance, poetry and music.  Drive the Pamir Highway  One of the greatest road trips in Asia, a drive down the Pamir Highway promises the full gamut of vistas; soaring mountains, desert plateaus and shimmering lakes. The highway goes through neighbouring Afghanistan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan, but some of the best sights can be seen along the Tajikistan section; Karakul Lake, a meteorite crater filled with water, and the snow-capped Peak Lenin are amongst the highlights.  Explore Hissor Fort  Located 20km (13 miles) to the west of Dushanbe, Hissor Fort is built on a promontory overlooking the valley. The reconstructed stone gateway is the only present-day remnant of the buildings that stood on this site, but the earthworks tell a story of a once impressive structure that began construction in the Neolithic era and then saw destruction and reconstruction with the advent of every successive invasion. The 16C Madrassa opposite is also worthy of investigation.  Explore the Panj valley  The Panj River cuts a deep gorge for approximately 300km (186 miles) along the border between Tajikistan and Afghanistan. On the Tajik side of the river valley the Pamir Highway forges a precipitous route from village to village, but on the Afghan side an even more gut-wrenching path navigates sheer cliffs above foaming rapids – local Afghans steer this path with the seeming footwork of mountain goats.  Hike to the largest glacier in the world  The Fedchenko glacier – the longest glacier in the world outside of the polar regions – is located in the Pamir Mountains. The glacier covers approximately 700 sq km (270 sq miles) and specialist tour operators do offers treks to see it.  Marvel at Zorkul Lake  In the far south east of the Eastern Pamir lies the stunning Zorkul Lake. Christened 'Lake Victoria' by British military explorers in the 18th century, Zorkul is significantly smaller than its African equivalent, albeit just as scenic. Accessed via and off-road track, visitors must purchase a Zorkul National Park permit which can be bought in Murghab. Speak to Murghab Ecotourism Association, 102 Osh Street, Murghab for more information.  Stay in a Kyrgyz yurt  For an authentic Tajikistan experience, adventurous tourists can stay in yurts with hospitable Kyrgyz nomads. The Murghab Ecotourism Association, 102 Osh Street, Murghab (www.meta.tj) work with local Kyrgyz people and offer a range of homestays in the area.  Swim in the ‘Tajik Riviera’  The Kairakhum reservoir is Tajikistan's closest approximation to a coastline. Located 20km (13 miles) west of Khujand, the manmade lake is home to a few sanatoriums and pensions where visitors can relax in the sunshine and swim in the lake. The area is also popular with birdwatchers, having been identified as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International.  Take in the Wakhan valley  In the 18th century, the Wakhan Valley became one of the most obscure geopolitical boundaries in the world as the British and the Tsarist colonial powers turned it into a no-man's land and passed it into Afghan territorial ownership.  Known as the Wakhan Corridor this wide and fertile valley runs for approximately 200km (130 miles) between Afghanistan and China, passing through Tajikistan. The Tajikistan stretch of the valley provides stunning views and the locals are used to visitors and welcome them with open arms.  Trek the Fann Mountains  Kissing the sky at 5,000m (16,404ft), the Fann Mountain are home to some of the highest peaks in Tajikistan, not to mention the beautiful Marguzor Lakes. Also known as the Seven Lakes, these turquoise lagoons are popular with hikers and photographers alike.  Iskanderkul (Alexander's Lake) is a particularly stunning lake, which, according to folklore, is where Alexander the Great lost his favourite warhorse – Bucephalus – which drowned in the lake. Locals say that on clear, summer nights the horse surfaces again to graze on the shoreline.",asia,,
surinam,"The smallest of the Guyanas (the collective term for Guyana, French Guyana and Surinam), this diminutive destination may only have half a million odd inhabitants, but it’s the liveliest of these onetime colonial backwaters. It’s also often overlooked by travellers, which is their loss because Surinam has much to offer.      The country is culturally fascinating. Languages spoken include Dutch, Creole, Chinese and English, which reflects the vibrant ethnic mix of its people. It’s also extraordinarily beautiful: the capital city is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and its tropical forests are full of wildlife, with an impressive one third of the country protected in nature reserves.      The 17th-century UNESCO capital, Paramaribo, is a good starting point for any trip. Home to a sumptuous collection of wooden colonial buildings, which line the waterfront, the city also lays claim to Central Market, a high-energy bazaar selling everything from quack medicine to fresh fish. At night you can dine on fresh seafood in local restaurants and cut shapes in lively bars, which are far removed from the tranquillity of the rest of the country.      Surinam's main attraction is its tropical rainforest, which covers nearly 80% of the country and harbours a huge variety of wildlife. Ecotourism is well developed here and some of the best lodges in South America can be found in the country’s jungle. With its intricate lattice of rivers, boat is the best way to get around the rainforest and you can take tours to see nesting leatherback turtles or search for other exotic creatures, including Amazon river dolphins, monkeys and, if you’re really lucky, a jaguar.      The country’s diverse cultural roots have also been well preserved: communities of Amerindians and Maroons – descendants of former African slaves – lie deep in the jungle, offering visitors an insight into their lifestyle, harmoniously adapted to their environment. Back in the cities, the busy festival calendar covers an eclectic range of events including jazz jamborees, Easter Carnival and exuberant Christmas parties, which climax on New Year’s Eve with the legendary Surifesta. It’s a wild and wonderful celebration. It’s Surinam in a microcosm.","Surinam  Attractions in Surinam  Galibi Nature Reserve  Watch giant leatherback sea turtles laying their eggs in the Galibi Nature Reserve (accessible by boat only) between February and July.  Go swimming  Go swimming in the unusual but popular location of Colakreek, a recreation area 50km (32 miles) south of Paramaribo consisting of numerous creeks in the small savannah belt behind the coastal plains.  Independence Square  Stroll around Paramaribo's Independence Square, the Presidential Palace (with an attractive palm garden) and the lively waterfront and market districts. Palmentuin is a pleasant park, as is the Cultuurtuin, but the latter is a fair distance from the town.  Jodensavanne  Travel south of Paramaribo to reach Jodensavanne (Jews' savannah), where the remains of a 17th-century Jewish settlement include the ruins of one of the Western Hemisphere's first Jewish synagogues - established 1639.  Paramaribo  Explore Paramaribo, the 17th-century capital, which is graced with attractive British, Dutch, French and Spanish colonial architecture. The nearby restored Fort Zeelandia houses the Surinam Museum.  River boat tour  Hop on a river boat tour to visit indigenous villages or picturesque old colonial plantations. One of the most popular trips is the five-day river tour of Kumalu and the Awarra Dam region.  Roman Catholic cathedral  See the 19th-century Roman Catholic cathedral (made entirely of wood - as is the 17th-century synagogue, which lies in stark contrast to the biggest mosque in the Caribbean), also in Paramaribo.  Swamps and crocodiles  Take a boat trip into the swamps to spy on crocodiles, anacondas and boa constrictors taking the sun, and mind the piranhas if you dare take a paddle!  Wildlife  Keep your eyes peeled for the rainforest's resident wildlife - including wild cats, tarantulas, howler monkeys, rare flowers and giant termite nests. Nearly 80% of the country is covered with tropical rainforest.

Haggle at the floating market  Historic Willemstad is edged by the island's natural harbour, Schottegat, where Curaçao's famous floating market takes place. Get a dose of local culture and observe dozens of colourful barges full of Venezuelan wares and agricultural produce. Haggle hard, because the vendors will.  Have a taste of Curaçao  No visit to the island is complete without tasting Curaçao's famous eponymous liqueur, made using dried peel from the laraha citrus fruit. For a complimentary tipple, head to the Willemstad distillery and sample a glass of the original recipe, which dates back to 1886.  Hike in Shete Boka National Park  Delve into a string of hiking trails in this compact bird-filled nature reserve that boasts stunning views of Curaçao's rugged north coast. Sea turtles breed in the protected waters below and the conservation zone is renowned for its otherworldly limestone grottoes and fossilised caves.

Professional watersports schools abound, offering classes for beginners and groups.  Hop aboard the Willemstad Trolley Tour  See historic Willemstad on a narrated tour aboard an open-sided land train, which departs Fort Amsterdam to the sound of clanging bells. The ""train"" then journeys downtown through Willemstad's pretty pastel-coloured, red-roofed colonial streets. It's a fine way to see the UNESCO old town.  Journey to the Jewish Cultural Historical Museum  Visit the Mikvé Israel Emanuel Synagogue and learn more about the sacred building's history at the nearby Jewish Cultural Historical Museum. The oldest synagogue in the western hemisphere, services are still held weekly and the floor is scattered with imported sand.  Party at Carnival  Costumed partygoers fill the streets during Curaçao's Carnival season, when ancient Catholic rites and African-Caribbean traditions fuse, creating a riot of colour, pomp, and revelry. One of the largest and longest lasting carnival spectacles in the Caribbean, merrymaking begins early January and continues until early March.  Peek inside Museum Kura Hulanda  This fascinating anthropological museum includes an exhibition on the history of the slave trade in the Americas. The museum boasts the largest African collection in the Caribbean and was opened in 1999. Poignantly, the building is situated on the site of a former slave yard and merchant's home.  Plumb new depths in a submarine  Visitors can explore Curaçao's magnificent underwater world without getting wet thanks to the SeaWorld Explorer submarine, which takes passengers of all ages on a subaquatic tour of offshore wrecks and coral reefs. Huge shoals of rainbow-hued tropical fish dart around the windows, allowing privileged views of sponge gardens and marine life.  Test your golfing skills  At Blue Bay Golf Club, mischievous sea breezes make the par-72, 18-hole course a battle of wills, with lagoons, small lakes and a plunge ravine into the sea. Have a camera ready for the signature fifth hole, with a setting of rugged clifftops and open skies.  Waltz back in time at Curaçao Museum  Pop into Curaçao Museum and browse a fascinating collection of antiques and art. Housed in a building dating back to 1853, the museum also contains artefacts from the indigenous Caiquetio tribes and has a pretty garden, which is used to host moonlit musical jamborees.",caribbean,,
guernsey,"Lush botanical gardens, alluring hidden coves, and glorious sunsets over the Atlantic Ocean give the Channel Island of Guernsey an unlikely subtropical feel. Sitting just 50km (30 miles) from the shore of Normandy in France, this little isle also has a Gallic air with its French street names and culinary flair. Listen carefully and you may even hear the ancient local dialect of Dgèrnésiais (Norman patois) being spoken.      Although small, only 62 sq km (38 sq miles) in size, Guernsey harbours a strong local identity. It's a self-governing British Crown dependency, and the locals are quick to point out that it is not part of the United Kingdom and European Union. Keen-eyed observers will spot a few differences, like blue post boxes and the use of numerical car plates. On May 9 Liberation Day, the islanders celebrate the end of the German occupation during World War II with the towns and houses across the island decked out in flags and bunting.      British families have been drawn to Guernsey for generations – it certainly is the quintessential holiday destination, where kids can roam free while parents relax with a book on the beach. The pace of life is certainly more relaxed than Britain, so visitors can take their time, wander the coastline, enjoy a round of golf and stroll the streets of the island's pretty capital, St Peter Port.      Vazon Bay on the north western coast of Guernsey is the largest beach among the island's 27 beaches. Meanwhile, the southern coast's rocky coastline is perfect for nature-loving kayakers who can gaze back at the towering cliffs, or even get up onto the rocks for coasteering and abseiling. Alternatively, head to Cobo Bay and Vazon Bay to join scores of kitesurfers and windsurfers testing their mettle out to sea.      Landmarks to look out for on Guernsey include the Little Chapel and Castle Cornet, while a little patch of France comes in the form of Victor Hugo’s house. With daily ferries to the nearby islands of Herm, Sark and Jersey are popular, Guernsey also makes a great base from which to explore the other Channel Islands.","Guernsey  Attractions in Guernsey  Castle Cornet  Overlooking the harbour in St Peter Port stands Castle Cornet. Built between 1206 and 1256 following the division of the Duchy of Normandy, it bears influences from many eras, through to the German occupation of WWII. It houses five museums – The Story of Castle Cornet Museum, 201 Squadron (RAF) Museum, Maritime Museum, Royal Guernsey Light Infantry Museum and Royal Guernsey Militia Museum. From March to November, there is a daily cannon fire at noon and from April to September, the castle also hosts outdoor theatre performances.  Castle spotting  Fortifications are scattered all around the coast - among them Ivy Castle near Le Bouet, a Norman stronghold, and Vale Castle at St Sampson. On the West Coast lies Fortress Rousse, an 18th-century tower open to the public.  Cliff-top walks  Out of the 42 miles of cliff and coastal paths on the island, many hikers prefer the south coast cliff walks starting from La Vallette and finishing at Pleinmont. The 270 descending steps leading to the secluded Petit Port, and the 300 ascending steps to the Saints Bay headland are definite highlights. Every May and September, the island also hosts walking festivals with accredited guides leading many walks.  Diving  Diving and snorkelling excursions and courses are popular with families and professional divers alike. Divers can enjoy a variety of marine life on the reefs, while seasoned divers can explore one of the many wrecks littered around Guernsey's coast.  Experience German occupation  There are four museums on the island covering the dark history during Germany's WWII occupation of the Channel Islands – the German Underground Hospital at La Vassalerie, the German Occupation Museum at Forest (with a reconstruction of an occupied street), the La Vallette Underground Military Museum at La Vallette, and the German Naval Signal Museum at St Jacques.  Hit the beach  There are 27 beaches on the island to suit everyone. Vazon Bay on the north is the largest and an excellent surfing beach. L'Eree Bay on the west boasts a wide crescent beach of glorious soft white sand. The east-facing Fermain Bay is another beautiful spot for swimmers and sunbathers.  Lihou Island  Accessible to walkers only for a couple of hours at low tide, this island is home to flocks of seabirds. Clamber down rocks to Venus Pool, a deep and sheltered rock pool that is sensational and great for a swim.  Little Chapel  The Little Chapel at Les Vauxbelets is thought to be the smallest church in the world, with space for a priest and a congregation of five. The exterior and interior walls are entirely bedecked in colourful fragments of crockery, making this a charmingly quirky spot in Guernsey.  Prehistoric Guernsey  Dolmens (Neolithic tombs) are common on the island. Déhus Dolmen in Vale is the best-kept Dolmen in Guernsey with a bearded figure carrying a bow and arrow. Le Trépied, on a mound overlooking Perelle Bay, was reputedly once a witches' meeting place.  Roquaine Bay  A shingle beach, Rocquaine Bay has a small harbour and is the venue of Rocquaine Regatta, a popular summer event featuring a day of activities including raft races. At one end of the bay stands Fort Grey, a tower built in 1804 to defend the west coast. Affectionately nicknamed 'Cup and Saucer', Fort Grey now houses the Shipwreck Museum.  Sausmarez Manor  Take a peek into this historic Sausmarez Manor in St Martin. From May to October, there is a ghost tour on some Thursday evenings plus a farmer's market on every Saturday morning with a few stands selling fresh and local produce. Within the compound, there is also a sub-tropical garden displaying beautiful sculptures.  St Peter Port  The island's charming capital St Peter Port has cobbled streets spreading out from its picturesque marina leading visitors to a plethora of attractions including the Guernsey Tapestry at the Gallery in St James Concert Hall and Hauteville House, former home of French writer Victor Hugo. On the south side stands Castle Cornet, an 800-year old castle which now houses five museums. A little further south from there you will find three Victorian bathing pools, the La Vallette Underground Military Museum and the Guernsey Aquarium.  Surfing  Catch the breaks off the coast of Guernsey, with many locals agree that Vazon Bay, with six surfing spots depending on the swell and wind conditions, is the best area for beginners and seasoned surfers.  Victor Hugo's House (Closed in 2018)  Pay your respects to Victor Hugo at Hauteville House, above the south side of St Peter Port, where he once lived. It was here that he wrote The Toilers of the Sea (which is set in St Sampson). In 1914, the French government gifted Guernsey a statue of Victor Hugo which now stands in Candie Gardens.",europe,channel islands,
united kingdom,"Few places cram in as much scenery, history and culture as the United Kingdom. It’s a busy, eccentric and unique destination; a land of daft humour, tea-and-cake clichés and a thousand and one different personalities; a land where thrusting cities like London, Glasgow and Manchester share map space with the peaks of Snowdonia and the colossal slopes of the Highlands.      Four component nations make up the UK, and the end result is as many-layered as that fact would suggest. Its arts scene continues to be one of the most creative and successful in the world, its passions still run high on everything from politics to sport and its overall character is as modern as it is multicultural. Even the food’s good these days.      London remains the natural focal point. Its skyline, mixing medieval turrets with soaring steel, is a good marker for the place as a whole. From its markets to its museums, its pubs to its palaces, it’s a bona fide world city packed with diversity.  But you don’t have to look far to find other great urban centres – England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are all home to richly engaging cities full of heritage, music and nightlife. Some, like Bath and Edinburgh, offer postcard-perfect medieval skylines. Others, like Belfast and Liverpool, are handsome in places but just as notable for their indelible personalities.      As a country, of course, the UK’s urban centres are just one part of its allure. Britain is often extremely beautiful. Seaside towns, national parks and honey-stoned villages still fill the guidebooks, and the scenic pull of areas like the Cornish coast, Giant’s Causeway and the Lake District is as strong as it’s ever been. Once you factor in the endless cultural associations that Britain throws up – from Henry VIII to Hogwarts, The Beatles to Braveheart, male voice choirs to Monty Python – it stands as a country very much its own.","United Kingdom  Attractions in United Kingdom  Gardens of La Seigneurie  The Royal Horticultural Society ranked these gardens as among the finest in the Channel Islands.

Moorings are located at Havre Gosselin on the west coast of Sark, and at La Gréve de la Ville bay on the east coast.  St Anne's Church  St Anne's focal point is the town church, often referred to as the 'Cathedral of the Channel Islands' as it is one of the largest in the Channel Islands. It is also the home of the Alderney Society Museum, which documents the island's history from Neolithic times.  Whale watching  Basking sharks and dolphins love the waters around the Isle of Man and can frequently be seen, often within one kilometre of the coast.

The self-styled ‘outdoor recreation capital of the East’ is shaking off any images of being a down-at-heel, coal-mining state, and has transformed itself into a giant natural playground, thanks to its forested hills, white-water rapids, underground caverns and powder-topped Appalachian Mountains.      West Virginia offers a veritable A to Z of adrenaline adventures, from all-terrain vehicle rides along one of the world’s largest off-road courses to zip-lining through gorges at night.      The Monongahela National Forest sprawls across the state’s highest peaks and is dotted with campgrounds and log cabins, which fill up in summer with hikers, mountain bikers, anglers and horse riders. If these activities all sound a bit tame, swing your climbing harness and ropes over to Seneca Rocks, a craggy quartzite outcrop jutting 270m (900ft) above the North Fork River.

st eustatius,"Popularly known as 'Statia', St Eustatius was a thriving port during the 17th and 18th centuries, becoming known throughout the Caribbean as 'The Golden Rock'. In fact, for a time, it was the busiest seaport in the world. Much-favoured as a tax-free haven, it grew to a population peak of around 30,000. Given St Eustatius' relative anonymity today, you might think 'how the mighty have fallen'. But any visit to the island will dash such foolishness from your mind.  Bathed in Caribbean sunshine, with only one town, Oranjestad (not to be confused with the Aruban town of the same name), St Eustatius a sleepy, pretty haven from another time. Made up of cottages and waterfront houses, Oranjestad is deserving of a wander, but then it's essential to explore the island's rural hinterland and rugged volcanic hillsides.  The decline of St Eustatius from the 19th century onwards – brought about, incidentally, by French conquest and the imposition of heavy taxes – has now halted. It's true that this is largely thanks to the influx of tourists.  Like other countries in the region, St Eustatius became a special municipality of the Netherlands following the dissolution of Dutch Antilles in 2010. The foundations of the Dutch sea walls are now sunk beneath the clear waters of the bay today, though scuba divers and snorkelers can see many of the submerged ruins. Other attractions on the island include walking up The Quill, surfing off the northeast coast, and going on fishing trips.  The nightlife is centred on the main hotels and restaurants, including dancing and local live bands, which may play one of the two different indigenous blends of reggae and calypso - 'Pim Pim' and 'Hippy'. Leave your troubles at the airport – St Eustatius is all about taking it easy.","St Eustatius  Attractions in St Eustatius  Get down to The Quill  Situated on the south side of the island The Quill/Boven National Park is home to a volcano named The Quill. Protected as a national park since 1998, The Quill stands at an impressive height of 2,000ft (609m) and you can explore the crater inside. The Dutch settlers first called it Kuil, while the English chose to rename it Quill.  Have a go at watersports  Go windsurfing or waterskiing; these and other watersports are well catered for on the island. Enjoy the island's superb scuba-diving opportunities. Many wrecks filled with marine life lie on the black sand amid coral reefs and near the submerged old port just off Oranjestad. Dive centres offer complete courses and equipment hire.  Have a wander around the Old Town  Take a stroll around the restored Old Town. A highly recommended visit is to the Miriam Schmidt Botanical Garden. Named after the founder who opened the garden in the 1990s. It opens from sunrise to sunset and tours are available during weekday mornings and also by special arrangement.  Hike the Mazinga trail  Staying in The Quill/Boven National Park you can also get on the Mazinga Trail through the lush interior. The trail is teeming with an abundance of plant life such as giant tree ferns, wild balsam and begonias. Not to mention at least 17 different kinds of beautiful orchids, with many rare species. Then there's the teeming wildlife that includes butterflies, exotic birds, iguanas and land crabs.  Party at the Carnival  It's worth checking ahead, but the last week of July on St Eustatius tends to signal party time with music, dance, food and lots of theatrics. The Carnival was founded in 1964 and for over half a century has been a major part of the island's culture. It's a fine time for locals and visitors and an opportunity to relax and let your hair down.  Salute the past at Fort Oranje  Catch glimpses of the island's past by wandering about the colonial houses and visiting Fort Oranje, which was built by the French in 1629 and still has intact cannons. Other noteworthy sites include Fort Amsterdam or even going underwater to see the bay's sunken Dutch sea walls.  Snorkel the warm seas around St Eustatius  Take advantage of the warm and clear water and coral displays by going snorkelling. Perfect for beginners or old hands, there are plenty of dive walls, reefs and shipwreck sites. Preserving the marine life is St Eustatius Marine Park that has specially contained dive sites.  Spend some time on the unspoiled beaches  Relax on many beautiful and unspoiled beaches with unusual layers of black and tan sand. The three beaches are each different in character. Oranje Bay is good for swimming but doesn't have much in the way of sand, while Zeelandia Beach and Lynch Beach are good for sunbathing. Be aware than none have lifeguards.  Uncover the Jewish Cemetery  Hunt down the weed-choked Jewish Cemetery, which is connected to Synagogue Honen Dalim, the second-oldest synagogue in the New World. From 2001, this place of worship has undergone a continuing restoration project to preserve the proud Jewish history on the island.",caribbean,,
czech republic,"A historic jewel at the heart of Europe, the Czech Republic packs a sizeable punch for such a small country; from majestic castles to medieval towns, elegant spa resorts to scenic national parks, it has much to offer international visitors. It is also, lest we forget, the birthplace of the world’s finest beer.      At the heart of it all is the culture-crammed capital, Prague. Dubbed the “city of a thousand spires,” it comprises beautiful churches, cobbled lanes and medieval bridges, all watched over by a fairytale castle. Add to that a mix of ancient monuments, fine dining, old breweries, bustling markets and lively jazz clubs. There really is never a dull moment.      Yet those who fail to venture beyond the city boundaries are truly missing out. Located just a short drive from the capital are some extraordinary attractions; the hot springs of Karlovy Vary; the giant gothic castle of Karlštejn; the church made of human bones in Kutná Hora; and the city of Plzeň, where pilsner beer was born.      Formerly part of Czechoslovakia, since the Velvet Divorce of 1993 – when Slovakia and the Czech Republic parted company – the latter has emerged the more popular with tourists. And to understand its appeal one must consider its assets; the stunning wine-growing region of Monrovia, home to rolling hills, traditional food and the spirited cities of Brno and Olomouc; the snow-capped mountains of Krkonoše; the otherworldly rock formations of Český Ráj; the wild forests of Šumava National Park; and the historic town of Český Krumlov, a fully deserving UNESCO World Heritage Site.      And yet, for all this, the Czech Republic is far more than the sum of its sights. This is a nation of proud, forthright and friendly people, eager to take a significant role on the European stage. It may only be a small country – and a relatively new one – but the Czech Republic leaves a big impression.","Czech Republic  Attractions in Czech Republic  Be enchanted by the capital, Prague  The capital city is an obvious place to start, but you'd be mad to miss it. Soak up the atmosphere in one of Europe's most beautiful and cultural spots with a cruise on the Vltava. Discover its UNESCO World Heritage-listed Old Town, medieval Charles Bridge and the spire-filled district of Malá Strana, which is home to the world's largest citadel, Prague Castle.   Clamber the Adršpach-Teplice Rocks  If you love rock climbing, you'll love the Adršpach-Teplice Rocks. These unusual sandstone rock formations form the basis of a nature reserve in the north of the Czech Republic, which is also home to contorted canyons and wildlife-filled forests – and make for unique rock climbing opportunities. You'll find many operators in the area.  Cycle and sip your way through Moravia  Hire a bike and pedal your way around the rolling hills, glistening vineyards and historic villages of South Moravia.

Expect outdoor adventure at Krkonoše  Whether you come in summer or winter, a trip to Krkonoše is a must. This lofty mountain range, which skirts the Czech-Polish border and has the highest peak in the country, offers wonderful hiking and cycling during the summer – and even better skiing during the winter. Just don't expect to have it all to yourself.  Explore Bohemia's once-mighty economic centre, Kutná Hora  Explore the ancient silver mine and marvel at the magnificent murals in St Barbara's Cathedral in Kutná Hora. This pretty medieval town and UNESCO World Heritage Site once rivalled Prague and even London in terms of size and importance, and this legacy can be seen in the fine Gothic and Italianate buildings that line the cobbled streets.  Explore the Renaissance town of Telč  The cobbled streets of Telč are one of the most idyllic examples of a Renaissance town in Europe, earning it well-deserved UNESCO World Heritage Site. The town was rebuilt after a fire in 1530, so medieval arcades with their gabled houses surround the picturesque town square.  Explore the fairytale castles of Karlštejn and Konopiště  The Czech Republic is home to an array of picture-postcard castles and two of the finest are within easy reach of Prague. 14th-century Karlštejn is a Disney-esque fairytale castle hidden in a valley between forested hills, while Konopiště is a spectacular Baroque-style château and the last residence of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria.  Fall in love with the pretty city of Český Krumlov  UNESCO World Heritage Site Český Krumlov is widely considered to be the Czech Republic's most picturesque town.

Find the time to visit pretty Olomouc  The attractive university town of Olomouc is noted for its green parks, baroque churches, sculptures and fountains – not to mention its UNESCO-listed Holy Trinity Column and grand astronomical clock. The surrounding Hana region is strongly agricultural, with many villages holding attractive harvest festivals in late September.  Luxuriate at the famous Karlovy Vary spa  Kick back and relax at the attractive spa resort of Karlovy Vary, which offers hot mineral springs, fine baroque and Gothic architecture, forest walks and a lively cultural scene. Finally, don't miss the picturesque castle at nearby Loket, set high above the River Ohre.  Paddle the Vltava river at Borová Lada  Head to the upper reaches of the Vltava at Borová Lada for an exciting day of canoeing. This section of the river is picturesque, with gentle rapids and weirs, which makes it ideal canoe-touring territory for beginners. Many outfits will rent you canoes and camping gear in this region.  Reflect on the past horrors at Terezín  Learn about a darker period in Czech history at Terezín, a former Nazi concentration camp north of Prague. The Ghetto Museum, barracks and isolation cells, execution grounds and mass graves bring the horrors of the Holocaust to life, ensuring it will never be forgotten.  See more grand designs at Hluboká and Vranov  Both history and design enthusiasts will find worthy excursion to Hluboká and Vranov nad Dyjí. The former is a grand and romantic baroque castle dating back to the 13th century, while the latter is an imposing Moravian château perched atop a giant rock overlooking the town.  See skull sculpture at Sedlec Ossuary  Get the creeps at Sedlec Ossuary, where the centuries-old bones of more than 40,000 people have been crafted into a stunning display of garlands, chandeliers, sculptures and coats of arms. This isn't one for the faint of heart, but there's nowhere else in the world quite like it.  Take a sip at the Pilsner Urquell Brewery  Make a pilgrimage to the birthplace of the world's best beer – the Pilsner Urquell Brewery in Plzeň, just an hour from Prague. It was here that pilsner lager was invented in 1842. Don't miss a guided tour through the medieval tunnels and beer cellars beneath the old centre.  Unearth the natural splendour of Šumava  Pack up your trekking poles and head for Šumava, the country's largest national park. A gobsmackingly beautiful region of forest-clad hills along the border with Austria, the giant park includes scenic lakes, trout streams, areas of virgin forest and important historic monuments.  Unwind in peace at Mariánské Lázně  The Czech Republic is famous for its hot springs, mineral baths and spa treatments, and they are not only to be found in touristy Karlovy Vary. Pretty Mariánské Lázně, in the west of the country, offers equally wonderful spa facilities for a significantly reduced price – as does nearby Františkovy Lázně.  Wonder at the sheer scale of Macocha's sinkhole  Peer into the dizzying abyss of Macocha, a spectacular 140-m (459-ft) deep sinkhole at the heart of the Moravský Kras (Moravian karst) near Brno, a limestone region riddled with caves. Then follow up this adventure with a cruise along an underground river at the nearby Punkevni Caves.",europe,,
central african republic,"One of the least visited countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, the Central African Republic ranks amongst the poorest nations on the planet and has struggled to find its feet since gaining independence from France in 1960. Suffice to say few tourists venture out this way.      A country of contrasts, the Central African Republic is a place where the Sahara Desert meets tropical Africa, where the pastoral traditions of Africa’s tribespeople rub shoulders with the colonial architecture of imperial France.      The French influence is particularly strong in the capital, Bangui, which retains its colonial aesthetic and is scattered with patisseries serving fresh baguettes and éclairs. Vibrant stalls around the central market provide cheap and tasty local cuisine, which ranges from fish straight out of the Ubangi River to fried plantain and fufu, a sour-tasting starch prepared from manioc flour which is a staple of the region.      The country’s frenzied markets are perfect places to interact with and better understand the culturally diverse tribespeople that make up the population. The shortest interaction with these people shows them to be inquisitive, warm and generous beyond their means.      Geographically, much of the Central African Republic is composed of rolling grasslands, dusty deserts and steamy jungles. The northern reaches of the country are dominated by the seemingly infinite Sahara. With so little light pollution here, the night skies gleams with millions of stars.      The far south is home to equatorial rainforests, which are considered some of the best places in Africa to see forest elephants and western lowland gorillas. The jungle is also home to pygmy tribes, which live off the land in remote pockets of central Africa. Visits to these tribes are possible and offer an insight into their extraordinary lives.","Central African Republic  Attractions in Central African Republic  Admire traditional wooden houses in Zinga  See some rare examples of beautifully constructed wooden houses in the friendly town of Zinga on the Ubangi River, one of the Congo's largest tributaries. The most atmospheric way of reaching the town is by motorboat or traditional canoe from Bangui, which lies some 100km (60 miles) north of Zinga.  Explore the riverside capital, Bangui  Shaded by tropical greenery, Bangui's city centre is a fine place to while awaya day or two. Star attractions include the tomb of the emperor-president Jean-Bédel Bokassa, which lies in the Berengo palace grounds, and a colourful central market renowned for its malachite necklaces. The Grande Corniche leads to the banks of the River Ubangi and provides a picturesque view of the fishermen's round huts and traditional canoes.  Go on safari  In the dry season, take a 4x4 and spot wildlife in the Central African Republic's national parks. The three most important are Manovo-Gounda St Floris, known for its high concentration of hippos, Bamingui-Bangoran in the north and Dzanga-Sangha in the southwest. The game population of the parks is impressive.  Relax beside Boali Waterfalls  At 250m (820ft) wide and 50m (165ft) high, the plunging Mbali River waterfalls near the charming village of Boali are a wonderful spectacle. Those wishing to linger and enjoy the views should grab a seat at the riverside restaurant, before paying a visit to the nearby hydroelectric power plant, which harnesses the energy of the cascading water.  Shoot some hoops  Basketball is the country's most popular sport and a good way to forge connections with the people of the Central African Republic. Almost every town has some sort of space for playing, while league teams meet regularly to fight for the title. International games are often screened in bars and cinemas.  Shop for handicrafts at Bangui’s artisans’ market  A great place to pick up a souvenir in a relaxed atmosphere, the capital's artisan market displays a range of traditional products from across the country. Handicrafts for sale include woven products, pottery, musical instruments, such as the xylophone-like balafon, and other hardwood carvings from the country's forested tropical belt.  Step back in time to ancient Africa  Around the town of Bouar, in the east of the country, 70 groups of upright megaliths called tajunu mark the locations of ancient burial mounds. Standing up to 5m (16ft) high, they are thought to date from Neolithic times, making them roughly the same age as England's Stonehenge.  View gorillas and elephants at Bayanga  The Dzanga-Sangha Reserve near Bayanga provides the opportunity to get up close and personal to several groups of habituated lowland gorillas while taking advantage of the good quality accommodation on offer. The platforms overlooking Dzanga and Sangha bais almost guarantee sights of shy forest elephant in search of a mud-bath.  Visit indigenous forest tribes  See indigenous forest tribes, including Pygmy people, living in encampments of small, low huts made of lianas and roofed with leaves in the Lobaye Region, 100km (60 miles) from the capital. The region is also known for producing coffee and visitors can visit plantations on the fringe of the forest, outside urban centres such as M'Baïki.  Witness nature at its most spectacular  Close to Kembé, a traditional village with mud-brick huts bearing thatched roofs, the Kotto River is churned white as it cascades over a spectacular V-shaped waterfall. Villagers use the river for washing and bathing, while children play in its strong currents most days.",africa,,
malawi,"Little Malawi is dwarfed by its much bigger southern African neighbours and this has undoubtedly affected both its tourism and its economy over the years.      But thanks to a number of successful conservation and wildlife reintroduction programs, Malawi is fast developing a reputation as an up-and-coming safari destination, and tourists are slowly cottoning on to the wealth of other offerings to be found in the so-called warm heart of Africa.      Malawi currently has nine national parks and wildlife reserves, six of which are especially recommended for visitors. There are also many attractive and accessible forest reserves. All the parks and reserves are uncrowded and give visitors an excellent experience of unspoiled wilderness. In 2012, lions were reintroduced into Majete Wildlife Reserve after a 30-year absence, which means Malawi is once again home to the Big 5 (lion, leopard, elephant, buffalo and rhino).      As well as iconic African wildlife, Malawi also boasts diverse scenery, including deep valleys, evergreen forests and waterfalls, all presided over by the dramatic peaks of Mount Mulanje and the rugged and regal Zomba Plateau in the south.      Outdoor activities are central to any visit to Malawi. You can trek, mountain bike or horse ride in entirely natural surroundings or climb peaks and plateaus. But the vast Lake Malawi remains the shimmering jewel in Malawi’s crown. Cut into the Great Rift Valley and stretching from the northern tip of the country to Mangochi in the south, Lake Malawi is Africa’s third largest lake. Some of the world’s rarest tropical fish are found here, not to mention myriad bird species. It’s a dream destination for twitching, scuba diving and kayaking, or simply relaxing by the beach.      Though Malawi remains one of the poorest countries in Africa, unlike some its neighbours it is an inherently peaceful place. And what it lacks in economic capital, it more than makes up for with its natural riches and ubiquitous kindness.","Malawi  Attractions in Malawi  Climb the Mulanje Massif  Rising out of the surrounding plains and tea-growing Mulanje region, the massif is popular with hikers and climbers, and has several huts. The highest point of this huge block of mountains, which cover more than 640 sq km (250 sq miles), is Sapitwa Peak. At just over 3,000m (10,000ft), it is the country's loftiest summit.  Explore the Lower Shire Valley  In Malawi's far south, the Lower Shire Valley has a very different look and feel. Low lying with higher temperatures, it is dominated by the River Shire. The only river to drain from Lake Malawi, it goes on to join the mighty Zambezi. A fertile region, there are vast sugar plantations to be seen at Sucoma.  Follow in the footsteps of Livingstone  View the many markets on the shore of Lake Malawi, including Nkhotakota, one of Africa's oldest market towns and a major centre of the Arab-Swahili slave trade until David Livingstone convinced Chief Jumbe to end the practice. Further north, Nkhata Bay is a busy port and market and a favourite with visitors for its lush tropical atmosphere.  Get active on the Nyika Plateau  Hike, mountain bike or ride a horse on the grassland of Nyika Plateau, where safaris on horseback are a popular activity. Fully encompassing Nyika National Park, the plateau is known for its wildlife, particularly Burchell's zebra and endemic butterfly, bird and orchid populations. Accommodation and equipment hire is at Chelinda.  Go on safari in Liwonde National Park  Due to its unspoiled environment and prolific game, Liwonde National Park is generally considered the best reserve in Malawi. Covering 550 sq km (212 sq miles) of thin woodland in the country's south, wildlife includes large herds of elephant, hippos, lion, and a vast array of birds and antelope. Alternatively, look out for elephant and buffalo in Kasungu National Park.  Grab a rod and reel  Fishing, possible all year round on the southern lakeshore north of Mangochi and at Senga Bay, offers the opportunity to reel in ngumbo (yellow fish), mpasa (lake salmon) and ncheni (lake tiger) among other species. Trout fishing is easily arranged in the rivers and streams of the Nyika and Zomba Plateaus.  Head north to Mzuzu  Capital of the northern region, Mzuzu reflects the culture of the Tumbuka, while remaining largely agricultural with tea, coffee and rubber plantations. Africa's largest manmade forest lies to the south, and Nyika National Park and Vwasa Marsh Wildlife Reserve are nearby. The famous Livingstonia Mission, with its red brick homes and small museum, is approximately three hours away.  Immerse yourself in Lake Malawi  A range of watersports are available along the 580km (360 mile) length of Lake Malawi. Snorkelling and scuba-diving are increasingly popular because of the attraction of seeing the brilliantly coloured fish, the mbuna (African cichlids). Swimming, waterskiing, sailing and kayaking are all possible at various locations on the lakeshore.  Kick back in the capital, Lilongwe  Malawi's capital since 1975, Lilongwe was officially founded in 1906 as a colonial trading post. Alongside the traditional Old Town, with its interesting walled markets, is the modern New Town and seat of government with its imaginative architecture and beautiful garden setting. A short journey away is the famous pottery workshop at Dedza.  Learn about Blantyre’s history  Malawi's commercial capital and largest town was established at the end of the 19th century. Sights include the National Museum on Chichiri Hill, St Michael and All Angels Church and its associated clock tower with its links to David Livingstone, and Mandala House. The oldest European building in Malawi, it dates back to 1882.  Take in the view from Zomba Plateau  North of Blantyre, the 2,100m (6,890ft) Zomba Plateau offers spectacular views and fantastic walking, rock climbing and mountain biking. Its vast forests and waterfalls tower above Zomba, a university town and the former capital. Known for its colonial architecture and botanic gardens, the town is also home to a school of dressage.  Take the steamer to Likoma Island  Located near Malawi's marine border with Mozambique, Likoma and its sister island Chizumulu offer a glimpse of largely unspoiled East African ocean and excellent swimming. The town of Mbamba is the site of the Saint Peter's Anglican Cathedral. One of the largest churches in Africa, it was built by missionaries over a century ago.  Visit the world’s first freshwater national park  Lake Malawi National Park lies towards the southern extremity of the lake near Monkey Bay. Snorkelling or scuba-diving reveals tropical fish, while inland antelope and vervet monkeys can be seen. An 800-year-old baobab tree in the park is reported to have been one of explorer David Livingstone's favourite spots.  Witness a traditional dance  Traditional dances play a part in most ceremonies in Malawi. The Gule Wamkulu is an important dance performed by members of the Chewa tribe's Nyau brotherhood, who cover themselves in carved masks, feathers and skin paint. It takes place following the July harvest, and also at weddings and funerals.",africa,,
western australia,"The largest state in the country, Western Australia also makes credible claims to being the most handsome. Occupying the entire western third of this vast nation, it stands in stark contrast to its eastern counterparts: coastal development hasn’t occurred at the same furious pace as it has on the eastern seaboard, giving full billing to its raw national parks, relaxed coastal towns and rugged outback horizons. Western Australia’s vastness is a large part of its appeal – this is a destination that occupies travellers at length.      State capital Perth is isolated from the rest of Australia’s urban centres (and the rest of the world, come to think of it), but its laidback demeanour and ultra-modern skyline is much as you’d expect from a prosperous, cosmopolitan city. Close by is the energetic port town of Fremantle, where you can come calling for the weekend markets, excellent seafood restaurants and ubiquitous cafés.      Highlights elsewhere in Western Australia are nothing if not diverse. Travellers can sail with whale sharks on Ningaloo Reef, explore the majestic karri forests of Tall Timber Country, head into the stirringly feral lands of the Kimberley, sample the delicious fruits of the Margaret River wine region, take a scenic flight above the Bungle Bungles or gaze out along the never-ending sands of Broome’s Cable Beach.      Western Australia as a whole is a vast and physical region, somewhere layered with millennia of human history and endless wraparound panoramas. It’s not somewhere you’ll want to rush through.","Western Australia  Attractions in Western Australia  Aquarium  Watch rolling surf from wide expanses of white-sand beaches around Perth at Sorrento, Cottesloe, City, Floreat or Scarborough.

Take part in a cattle muster and retread the footsteps of the characters in Baz Luhrmann's epic film.  Nambung National Park  Look at amazing limestone pillars in Nambung National Park: visit the Pinnacles, calcified spires around 30,000 years old, which jut out of the sandy ground and provide the perfect snapshot. The nearby town of Cervantes is popular for its beaches and beach fishing.  National parks  Walk along the challenging but sensational Bibbulmun Track (963km/598 miles, from Kalamunda to Albany) (www.bibbulmuntrack.org.au) or around the spectacular red-walled chasms, subterranean pools and waterfalls comprising Karijini National Park in the Pilbara Region.

From a helicopter, the range is an especially imposing sight: a beautiful world of hidden gorges, pools and palms.  Spot sharks and whales  Swim with giant whale sharks, the world's largest fish, which make frequent appearances between March and early June at Ningaloo Reef, and whale watch in the Cape to Cape Region.  Surf  Catch waves at some of the best beaches in Australia, many around Perth, such as Trigg, Scarborough and Cottesloe.

australia,"Australia is a land of savage beauty, big adventure and even bigger horizons. There are good reasons why the country finds itself touted as one of the ultimate travel getaways; it has personality in spades, landscapes to die for and more than its fair share of sunshine. And if beaches, rainforest and outback aren’t your thing, then its major cities are outstanding destinations in their own right.      In many ways the country breeds extremes. The fiery atmosphere of an Aussie Rules match in Melbourne and the champagne glitz of Sydney Harbour belong to another planet entirely when compared to the quiet expanse of the Red Centre or the surf-bashed coastlines of the west.      Likewise, 40,000 years of Aboriginal culture sometimes seem an unnatural bedfellow for the famed “no worries mate” BBQ-lifestyle of modern times. When taken as a whole, however, the sum of Australia’s contrasts make it a destination that is as fascinating as it is diverse.      Knowing where to go is arguably the toughest part. There are well-travelled paths, with Sydney and the east coast being a perennially popular choice. When you’re faced with a country of this magnitude, however, potential itineraries are numberless. The Great Barrier Reef? Uluru? The Great Ocean Road? Kakadu? Hobart? The Kimberley? When the tourist board controversially coined the slogan “So where the bloody hell are you?” it raised a fair point.      There are iconic Aussie clichés by the barrel-load (from cork hats to barbecues, koalas to crocodiles, and cricketers to bush tucker) but the real beauty of the place lies in the stuff you’re not expecting; the dusty open road that unfurls to reveal verdant hills; the cold beer at an outback pub that turns into an evening-long session; the stroll to the beach that throws up a street market, open-air concert and implausibly beautiful sunset.      A trip Down Under has long been synonymous with escape, exploration and adventure – an image that's unlikely to change anytime soon.","Australia  Attractions in Australia  Canoe Nitmiluk Gorge  Also known as Katherine Gorge, this spectacular canyon system lies in the Northern Territory and rewards those who make the trip with one of the most memorable canoeing adventures in the country. The gorge is sacred to local indigenous groups. Choose from a few hours' hire to a multi-day trip.  Dive the Great Barrier Reef  Australia's east coast is brimming with mainstream tourist hotspots, from the brash hedonism of Surfer's Paradise to the 4-wheel-drive-friendly Fraser Island, but for most leisure visitors it's the Great Barrier Reef that remains the must-see sight. It's vast (2,300km/1,430 miles long, to be precise) and is arguably best experienced through diving and sailing trips to the Whitsunday Islands.  Drive the Gibb River Road  If you're looking for outback adventure, there are few better options than this 600km (370-mile) road across the Kimberley. Venerated by enthusiasts for both its rugged scenery and its challenging conditions, it can only be negotiated by 4-wheel drive vehicle. There's a shorter 'tourist loop' at the western end of the road.  Explore Melbourne  Some cities just get it right. And Melbourne is one of them, giving visitors everything from Victorian-era architecture to cutting-edge counterculture, while also placing plenty of importance on food, festivals, the great outdoors and sport. A month or so here, among the laneway bars and street markets, and you'll be praising the city for life.  Fly over the Bungle Bungles  Australia knows all about otherworldly landscapes, but the orange-striped beehive domes of the Bungle Bungle Range – high up in Western Australia in Purnululu National Park – is one of the most extraordinary examples in the country.  Take a scenic flight to get a sense of the scale of the domes.  Get arty in Adelaide  Generally to be found near the top of the list of those ""world's most liveable cities"" surveys, South Australia's capital is rightly seen as something of an urban gem. Attractive and uncrowded, it's renowned for its parks, its art galleries and its busy cultural calendar, which includes the largest arts festival in the southern hemisphere, the Adelaide Fringe.  Give Tasmania a try  Tasmanians cheekily refer to mainland Australia as 'the north island', and you can forgive the self-confidence. The island state is deserving of as much time as you can spare, cramming in an extraordinary variety of landscapes and outdoor activities. In Hobart, meanwhile, it also boasts a highly liveable capital city.  Go west to Perth  Western Australia's biggest city is something of a slow-burner. It lacks the immediate wham-bam of Sydney and Melbourne, but for those who take the time to explore its parkland, beaches and laidback urban vibe, it's somewhere that's easy to love. The surrounding region, offering up winelands and character-rich towns, adds to the appeal.  Go wild swimming in Litchfield  'Litchfield-do, Kaka-don't'. So runs the tongue-in-cheek advice from the Northern Territory's locals when it comes to choosing between their main national parks. Litchfield lacks the epic majesty of Kakadu, but its cascading waterfalls and swimming holes make it a deservedly more popular day-trip from Darwin.  Head to the Blue Mountains  The Blue Mountains' proximity to Sydney makes them a near-essential part of any New South Wales itinerary. Their name comes from the bluish haze given off by the eucalyptus trees that carpet the range's huge slopes. A great spot for everything from bush-walking to horse-riding.  Hike the Flinders Ranges  Many visitors never make it down to South Australia, which makes the rolling mountains of the Flinders Ranges all the more special. They play home to national parks, sleepy towns and the kind of true-blue Aussie character that the country's famous for – don't miss the colossal natural amphitheatre of Wilpena Pound.  Marvel at Kakadu National Park  Wrapped up in endless layers of spiritual significance, Kakadu National Park offers 20,000 sq km (7,700 sq miles) of untamed (and some would say unrivalled) Australian wilderness. There are crocs, creeks, escarpments and waterfalls, as well as an immense collection of ancient Aboriginal rock art.  Ride the Ghan  A north-south alternative to the east-west passage of the Indian Pacific, The Ghan passenger train chugs the full length of the country from Darwin to Adelaide, calling in at Alice Springs and Katherine en route. It's a great way of taking in the breadth of the outback while enjoying Aussie wine, good food and comfortable cabins.  Sink into Sydney  Where to start with Sydney? It's a toss-up as to whether the locals or the tourists do the most swooning over it, and once you've experienced the surf beaches, the harbour, the skyline and that warm, lazy-day culture, it's not hard to understand why. Give the place as much time as possible.  Travel the Great Ocean Road  Showcasing arguably the finest surf-pounded coastal scenery in the country, the Great Ocean Road sits within driving distance of Melbourne. It's 250km (155 miles) long, so can be 'done' in a couple of days – far better, though, to take your foot off the gas and experience its towns and beaches at a relaxed pace.  Visit Uluru  Every bit as magical as the hype would suggest, 'The Rock' is the kind of monumental natural feature for which sightseeing seems too crude a category. Getting there can be time-consuming, but the reward (like Uluru itself) is immense. Take time too to visit nearby Kata Tjuta, in many ways just as epic a landmark.",oceania,,
michigan,"Sizzling beaches, sprawling forests, boutique vineyards and buzzing cities: think Michigan is one big car factory? Think again.      Rising in the heart of the Great Lakes, this Midwestern state is split across two peninsulas, divided by Lake Michigan and linked by one of the world's longest suspension bridges across the Straits of Mackinac.      Michigan has more natural features than it knows what to do with. Once used by fur traders and loggers, Michigan’s 300-plus rivers are now perfect paddling territory. Then there are the 5,149km (3,200 miles) of shoreline and 11,000 inland lakes, where you can hook hefty trout and monster salmon or take a cruise.

Cosmopolitan Grand Rapids is an ultra-cool city with a thriving arts scene, farm-to-fork dining, and more than a dozen craft breweries. From there, it’s a handy half-hour jaunt to the sandy swimming beaches of Lake Michigan, where you can recline on shining shores, or flip a coin for the designated driver role on the lakeshore wine trail.      On the opposite side of the Lower Peninsula, Detroit may once have been associated with urban decay, but today, the state’s biggest metropolis is Michigan’s comeback kid.

armenia,"It might be a small nation, but Armenia is big on character. Its 20th century history was troubled and relations with neighbouring Turkey are still fractious to put it mildly – although a visit to the country today is more likely to be dominated by its medieval treasures than its more recent past.      The welcome is rarely anything less than warm – and usually accompanied by brandy – and the countryside itself is often breathtakingly beautiful. Tourist numbers are generally low, but you’ll find yourself wondering why.      This is a country with serious historical legacy. Christianity arrived in AD 301 and Armenia proudly calls itself the world's oldest Christian nation. Religion still tends to play a large part in visitor itineraries – from the centuries-old monasteries that stud the hilly Lori region to the mists-of-time bibles at the wonderful Museum of Ancient Manuscripts – but Armenia is changing.      Since the break-up of the Soviet Union, the country has re-embraced its traditions while moving on. Much of this progress is focused on the capital city of Yerevan. Loomed over on clear days by Mount Ararat across the border, it is the nation's hub of cultural activity and progressive thought, with a lively modern arts scene and plenty of large-scale redevelopment.      Armenia has a large diaspora population – there are thousands of Armenian Americans – and a lot of wealth has been brought back into the country as a result. But the passions that underpin life here, from patriotism to religion, chess to cognac, aren’t the sort that cost millions. Cafe culture has been perfected and it's de rigueur to spend inordinate amounts of time lingering over a conversation. Armenian food is another treat – expect mounds of grilled meats and vegetables straight from the nearest garden.      Around the country, travel highlights include the charming little town of Goris and the arty mountain settlement of Dilijan, but exploration anywhere in Armenia is likely to reap rewards.","Armenia  Attractions in Armenia  Bird watching  Spot rare species of birds, including eagles, falcons and swans. Armenia is home to 346 of Europe's 550 bird species.  Brandy drinking  Sample some of Armenia's excellent brandies, which Winston Churchill always insisted on after first tasting it at the Yalta conference.  Caving  Explore into some dazzling limestone caverns in Vayots Dzor. Near Goris you can explore cave homes carved into the hillsides.  Cultural sites  Yerevan's impressive array of cultural sites, including the National Gallery (founded in 1919) and the Yerevan library of ancient manuscripts (Materadaran), which houses over 13,000 texts. Don't miss the State Museum of Armenian History in Yerevan, which houses the country's best collection of historical artefacts.  Debed Canyon  Travel to the steep-sided Debed Canyon where you can visit the UNESCO-protected monasteries of Haghpat and Sanahin. It is believed that the great Armenian troubadour-poet, Sayat-Nova, was born in Sanahin, and became a monk at Haghpat.  Dilijan  Relax in Dilijan, a town set amid lovely pine forests with walking trails that ascend to alpine lakes. The town has a number of renovated Soviet-era sanatoriums and a community of retired artists.  Echmiadzin  Experience holy Echmiadzin, the capital of Armenia from AD 180-340, and the location of the Cathedral of St Gregory the Illuminator. The cathedral's treasury contains a spearhead believed to have been used to pierce the side of the crucified Christ.  Fishing  Cast a line into lake Sevan, where you can reel into Armenia's famous species of trout, the Salmon trout (Ishkhan), plus many more that swim in Armenia's other lakes and rivers.  Geghard Monastery  Make a pilgrimage to one of Armenia's most dramatic sights, the Geghard Monastery. A monastery has occupied this site since the fourth century AD, and the existing churches, all magnificently carved, date from the 13th century. Take a detour and visit Garni Temple. Earthquakes have destroyed most of the original structure, but the temple's vertiginous position, on a plateau 300m (984ft) above the Azat River, secures its beauty.  Goris  Journey to Goris, a town that has changed little since it was first planned by a 19th century German architect. The surrounding area is worth exploring for its cave dwellings. Nearby is the spectacular Tatev Monastery.  Hiking  Hike through Armenia's spectacular countryside, ambling over country roads through timeless villages or up steep mountain passes to catch a gorgeous sunrise.  Horse riding  Horse ride on Mount Aragats in the spring, when you can traverse Armenia's tallest mountain.  Lake Sevan  Much vaunted for its pure waters, stunning setting and delicious salmon trout, the lake is 70km (43 miles) east of Yerevan and the largest in the Caucasus.",europe,,
india,"As beautiful as it is bamboozling, India is an endlessly fascinating country that challenges and surprises even the most seasoned traveller.      Stretched between the golden beaches of the Indian Ocean and the snow-capped peaks of the Himalayas, India dazzles with an incredible tapestry of natural and man-made wonders. Home to some of the world’s most iconic monuments; its astounding temples, mystical monasteries, frenetic cities, pristine national parks, lavish palaces and mesmerising markets will capture and inspire your imagination.      Visiting India is an exciting assault on the senses. Sights, sounds, smells and sensations are all experienced at maximum intensity. It can feel intimidating on day one, but eventually, the noise and chaos become an ordinary part of everyday life. The sensory stimulation becomes strangely addictive. Presided over by an extraordinary array of gods and deities, approximately one-sixth of the planet's population can be found here, living in anything from high-rise apartments and inner-city shantytowns, to simple huts in remote villages. India is one of the world's great melting pots, where an incredible diversity of cultures, religions and ethnicities live in unexpected harmony.      An explorers paradise, you could spend a lifetime discovering the relics left behind from ancient empires and trekking its dramatic landscapes. From its tiger-filled jungles to the frozen Himalayan deserts, India’s veritable bounty of breath-taking scenery is sure to leave you awe-struck. On the first trip, almost everyone finds time for the so-called ‘Golden Triangle’; zipping from the colonial capital, Delhi, to the Taj Mahal at Agra, then on to Jaipur, the colourful capital of Rajasthan. With more time to spare, you can discover 36 UNESCO-listed sights ranging from creaking mountain railways and ancient fortresses to mangrove forests and temples overflowing with multi-armed deities.      Don’t expect to absorb all India has to offer in one visit; the country is best appreciated like a buffet table, with repeat visits to sample the next tantalising platter. And with India’s legendary cuisine, rest assured that on every trip, you will feast like a Maharaja.","India  Attractions in India  Ajanta and Ellora: discover an architectural masterpiece  The stunning rock-cut cave temples at Ajanta and Ellora are considered the crowning glory of Indian religious art. Carved into the walls of a high basalt cliff near Aurangabad, the caves stand as a testament to ancient India. The temples of Ellora were hewn by Buddhist, Hindu and Jain stone-carvers from the 5th to the 10th century. The nearby Ajanta caves are even older, with exquisite murals that may date back as far as the 2nd century BCE. The richly decorated caves are considered masterpieces of craftsmanship, earning UNESCO World Heritage status in 1983.  Andaman Islands: a taste of the tropics  For the real tropical paradise experience, there’s really only one choice. Floating off the east coast of India, the Andaman Islands are densely forested, ringed by sand and fringed by coral reefs teeming with tropical fish. This remote archipelago is also home to Adivasi tribal people whose ancient way of life endures despite the challenges of modernisation.  Bollywood: move to Indian rhythms  From the show-tunes of Bollywood to the haunting melodies of the sitar and shehnai (Indian oboe), Indian music has a way of getting into the blood. You’ll hear it everywhere, from temple courtyards and dinner shows to buses and marketplaces, where the singers of the latest movie soundtracks are treated with the kind of adulation normally seen for Beyoncé and Justin Beiber.  Buddhist India: explore India’s Buddhist communities  When the 14th Dalai Lama fled Tibet in 1959, he found sanctuary, along with the exiled Tibetan administration, in Dharamshala in Himachal Pradesh. Today, Tibetan Buddhist communities thrive across India, from the high-altitude deserts of Ladakh to the mountains of Himachal Pradesh and Sikkim, and beyond to remote Arunachal Pradesh, offering a whole different take on Indian spirituality.  Delhi: the capital of India  India’s capital is a riot of sounds, smells and sensations. Eight ancient cities have risen up on this site over the centuries, ruled by a string of empires. The heart of the city is Old Delhi, which overflows with forts, mosques and maze-like bazaars; south of the old city, the colonial architect Lutyens laid out New Delhi in wide avenues that house the grand Mughal gardens.  Goa: a sun-seekers paradise   Although less mellow than the happy-go-lucky days of the 1960s, the hippy hangouts of Goa have evolved into India’s favourite seaside resorts. The occasional full moon party can still be found in places such as Anjuna, but today, sunbathing, sipping local spirits and sampling the Portuguese-influenced coastal cuisine is more the vibe. The only state where pork is readily served, you can feast on locally made choriço (Goan sausage) and sample spicy variations of Vindaloo.  Hindu festival’s: a calendar of culture   The 33 million deities of Hinduism are celebrated in all their vivid glory at festivals such as Durga Puja (September/October) in Kolkata (Calcutta), where thousands of rainbow-coloured idols are immersed in rivers and pools. Other must-see celebrations include Holi, the festival of colours (March), Diwali, the festival of light (October/November), and the Kumbh Mela, the largest human gathering on Earth.  India’s beaches: grab your towel  Mumbai (Bombay) has Juhu and Chowpatty, and Chennai (Madras) has Marina Beach, but the best beaches of all are down in the south. Goa offers some of the nation's top strips of sand, while Kerala offers an even steamier version of the tropical south. Then there are the beaches of the Andamans – pure tropical perfection.  India’s national parks: spot the tigers  India boasts more than 100 national parks, 500 wildlife sanctuaries and 18 biosphere reserves, that provide a much needed home for endangered and rare species such as tigers, Asiatic elephants and one-horned Indian rhinos. Among the best-known reserves are Keoladeo National Park (Rajasthan), Ranthambore National Park (Rajasthan), Kanha National Park (Madhya Pradesh), Corbett Tiger Reserve (Uttarakhand) and Sunderbans Tiger Reserve (West Bengal).  India’s northeast tea plantations: grab a cuppa  Discover the origins of the humble cuppa on a tour of one of India’s tea plantations. Spreading out like green carpets, the plantations around  Darjeeling, Assam and the Nilgiri Hills of south India are vivid and lush. On a plantation tour, you’ll meet workers picking tea in a landscape of brilliant emerald and get a chance to sample India’s finest brews. For true tea lovers, the annual Tea Festival in the Jorhat region of Assam takes place between November and January and is truly an assault on the senses.  India’s temples: get in touch with your spiritual side  India overflows with temples, from modern marvels like Delhi’s Akshardham to the timeless glory of the erotic temples of Khajuraho. Amritsar’s Golden Temple is the most sacred site for the Sikh religion, with a daily throng of devotees that crowd its gilded interior. A tantalising blend of Hindu and Islamic architecture, its glowing gold dome tops an inner sanctum of intricately crafted ‘pietra dura’ work. In the east, Konark is also one of India’s treasures, built in the shape of a vast stone chariot; while the temples at Ranakpur in the west see hordes of Jain Pilgrims.  Jaisalmer: take a desert safari  Mughal India was the crowning glory of the Islamic world and the ancient cities of north India still swim with the romance of Arabian Nights. For the full experience, get out into the India's sprawling deserts on camel-back from Jaisalmer, and camp beneath an unbelievably clear panorama of stars.  Kashmir: adventure awaits   Kashmir manages to be both India’s most serene spot, and historically its most turbulent. The legendary Kashmir Valley is mesmerising, with its ancient mosques, Mughal gardens and houseboats drifting over its tranquil Dal Lake. Hikers will revel in Kasmir, with exceptional mountain views framing sleepy towns such as Sonamarg. Ladakh is also worth a visit, with the peaceful refrain of Buddhist temple bells tolling across its traditional whitewashed stupas.  Kerala: escape the city  For a complete break from India’s urban hubs, cruise along the tropical backwaters of Kerala and pause en route to peruse country villages, peaceful beaches and scattered temples. On board, you can sample one of India’s best-loved cuisines, with delicious seafood cooked in coconut curries. For something really unique, see Kerala’s kathakali dancers perform their elaborate routines.  Kolkata: the capital of arts and atmosphere  Where Mumbai is all razzle and dazzle, Kolkata exudes an air of calm sophistication. India’s unofficial capital of the arts is a fascinating collection of bustling bazaars, sprawling parks, and grand, decaying colonial monuments that once housed the government of British India. Life here may move to the same timeless rhythm as the turgid Hooglhy River, but a hipster culture also runs deep, with grand Bengali clubs nestled in its dynamic centre.  Mumbai (Bombay): the beating heart of India  Delhi may have the history and architecture, but Mumbai (formerly Bombay) is India’s capital of fashion, film, finance and fun. Mumbai is a city of phenomenal contrasts, where India’s tallest skyscrapers rise against a backdrop of ramshackle bazaars and slums. Attractions include ancient cave temples, colonial monuments, fine dining restaurants and the movie studios of Bollywood.  Rajasthan: home to forts and palaces   From the glorious capital, Jaipur, to the Blue City of Jodhpur and the White City of Udaipur, Rajasthan is awash with desert fortresses, terrific temples and the palaces of Maharaja. For the ultimate Rajasthani experience, head for the desert citadel of Jaisalmer, where camel safaris into the Thar Desert offer a little taste of what life was like in India’s glorious past.  The Highland Region: a blend of east and west  India’s hill stations are a bizarre facsimile of England, transported to the forested highlands of India. In towns such as Shimla (Himachal Pradesh), Darjeeling (West Bengal), Ooty (Tamil Nadu), Kodaikanal (Tamil Nadu), you’ll find grand colonial hotels, whitewashed churches and dainty teahouses set against a spectacular backdrop of Himalayan peaks.  The River Ganges: witness an ancient tradition  The mighty River Ganges is a direct channel to the divine for India’s Hindu population. The wondrous city of Varanasi, one of India's holiest Hindu pilgrimage towns, is blessed by the sacred waters, offering prayer and ablution to those who come to bathe at its riverside. Riverside ghats are mobbed daily at sunrise and sunset. A symbol of spirituality, philosophy and mysticism, Varanasi is a city not to be missed.  The Taj Mahal: the most romantic building in the world  India’s Golden Triangle offers a mesmerising circuit through Delhi, Jaipur and Agra; but it's the Taj Mahal that everyone comes to see. Described as the greatest monument ever built for love, it’s perhaps the most aesthetically perfect building on earth, constructed from gleaming white marble by the heart-broken Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan, for his favourite wife.  Yoga: find your inner zen  India is the birthplace of yoga, one of the world’s best-loved traditional therapies. Ashrams and yoga retreats across India offer first class instruction from the legacies of those who invented the fine art. Head to Haridwar or Rishikesh in the Uttarkhand hills to experience yoga at its spiritual source.",asia,,
sudan,"Sudan is hardly your archetypal tourist destination, but behind the unsavoury headlines is a country of exquisite natural beauty, ancient historical attractions and inhabitants well versed in the art of hospitality.      A vast country, three times the size of Texas, Sudan is as much about people as it is natural or man-made wonders. It is a nation where travellers can learn more drinking freshly prepared smoothies with the residents of Khartoum (Sudan is officially alcohol free) than they can by visiting one of the capital’s excellent museums.      A relatively young city, Khartoum was built in 1821 at the confluence of the Blue and White Niles while the country was ruled jointly by Britain and Egypt. History and traditionalism jostle with modernity in the city, where stunning classical Islamic architecture in red ochre hues stands beside modern glass and steel skyscrapers paid for by the country’s oilfields (which were mostly lost with the independence of South Sudan in 2011).      Centuries before colonial rule Sudan comprised a series of city-states. One of the longest lasting was Meroë, which sits some 200 km (125 miles) northeast of Khartoum. A UNESCO World Heritage Site, this ancient city features more than 200 steep-sided pyramids, which were built as elaborate royal mausoleums. They rise from the sandy dunes of the Nubian Desert and date from between 300 BC and AD 300, when the kingdom was at its most powerful.      Worth visiting in itself, the Nubian Desert – in reality part of the Sahara – offers solitude and unspoiled natural beauty stretching east all the way to the Red Sea and Port Sudan, the centre of Sudan’s burgeoning diving scene.      One of the least visited countries in East Africa, but one of the friendliest, Sudan has a magical mix of history, tradition and modernity that belies its status as a pariah state.","Sudan  Attractions in Sudan  Discover Khartoum’s hidden gems  With Omdurman and Bahri, Khartoum forms Sudan's unusual 'three-towns capital'. Among the tourist attractions are Omdurman's camel market and the Arab souk. Particularly noteworthy from a historical and artistic viewpoint is the well-organised National Museum, containing treasures dating back 6,000 years. The Khalifa's House Museum will reward those with an interest in Sudan's more recent history.  Dive into Sudan’s Red Sea marvels  More widely associated with desert landscapes than coral reefs, Sudan has a burgeoning diving industry centred on the Red Sea's Port Sudan from where scuba expeditions are led to various sites, including Jacque Cousteau's underwater village and Sanganeb reef.  Explore the coastal cities  Port Sudan, Suakin and the Arous Tourist Village are three of the best centres from which to explore the country's beautiful Red Sea coastline. If you can't handle the heat head to Erkowit, which sits 1,200m (3,930ft) above sea level and is home to a beautiful resort offering exquisite panoramas and evergreen vegetation.  Head south for wildlife viewing  The southern provinces are characterised by green forests, open parkland, waterfalls and treeless swamps. The bird and animal life here flourishes, and includes elephant, black and white rhino, antelope, zebra, crocodile, hippo, and the almost extinct shoebill. The Gemmeiza Tourist Village, situated in the heart of East Equatoria, is considered of special interest, owing to the abundance of game in the area.  Hike through the Jebel Marra mountains  The extinct volcanoes of Jebel Marra, at more than 3,000m (10,000ft), are the highest point in the vast Darfur region of western Sudan. It is a sparsely populated area of outstanding scenic beauty and small traditional villages, waterfalls, volcanic lakes and a pleasant Mediterranean climate.  Marvel at the Pyramids of Meroe  The Pyramids of Meroe are Sudan's most iconic tourist site. The product of a culture quite different to that of Egypt, these brick-built and steep-sided pyramids sprout in groups of a dozen at a time, and there's not a tourist tout offering souvenirs or camel rides in sight. Nearby are the archaeological sites of Naqa and Musawarat Es Sufra, which are worthy of a detour.  Travel back in time at Musawarat  One of the largest ancient temple complexes in Sudan, Musawarat is thought to have been a pilgrimage site. Modern pilgrims can wander the columns of the Great Enclosure to study the carved walls depicting the animals that once inhabited the region. Also worth visiting are the engraving of the marriage room, and the elephant stables.  Visit Dinder National Park  Covering 6,475 sq km (2,500 sq miles) southeast of Khartoum on the Ethiopian border, Dinder National Park is one of the largest in Africa. Providing homes for 27 species of large mammal including big cats and giraffe, it also provides habitats for a large variety of birdlife flying between Europe and Africa including pelican, kingfisher and the beautiful crown crane.  Wander among the ruins of Old Dongola  The now deserted Nile city of Old Dongola, which sits 80km (49 miles) from modern Dongola, represents one of Sudan's premier archaeological sites. An important medieval Christian city, the remains include those of a dozen churches, though the most prominent survivor is the large Throne Hall, which was constructed between the 9th and 10th centuries.  Watch the Blue and White Niles converge in Khartoum  The long straight roads of Omdurman lead to Sambat Bridge, a good place to view the sluggish and silt-laden waters of the reddish-brown Blue Nile converge with the clearer, lighter shades of the White Nile. Just south, the manmade wonder of the Gezira irrigation canals cover almost 9,000 sq km (3,500 sq miles) of land for cotton production.",africa,,
french overseas possessions,"Scattered throughout the world are various French Overseas Possessions. A hangover from the colonial era, these possessions fall into various classifications: French Overseas Departments (Départements d'Outre-Mer or DOM), French Overseas Territories (Territoires d'Outre-Mer or TOM), French Overseas Collectivities (Collectivités Territoriales or COM) and French Special Collectivity.      The following DOM and TOMs all have their own sections: French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, New Caledonia, Réunion and Tahiti. Basic information on the others is given here:      French Overseas Departments      There are five overseas departments, each one an integral part of the French Republic. Guadeloupe and Martinique are both in the Caribbean; French Guiana is on the northwest coast of South America; and Réunion and Mayotte are both in the Indian Ocean. Despite the greater autonomy achieved with the formation of their own individual Regional Councils in 1974, each French Overseas Department still returns elected representatives to the Senate and National Assembly in Paris, as well as to the European Parliament in Strasbourg.      French Overseas Territories      The French Southern and Antarctic Lands are located in the Southern Indian Ocean and are the only French Overseas Territories. Comprised of five islands in all, each one is home to a handful of inhabitants and is administered by an appointed representative of the French government.      French Overseas Collectivities      There are five French Overseas Collectivities in all. French Polynesia is found in the Pacific Ocean; Wallis and Futuna is also found in the Pacific Ocean; St-Pierre and Miquelon is found near Newfoundland, Canada; and Saint Barthélemy and Saint Martin are both located in the Caribbean. They are integral parts of the French Republic and are administered by a Prefect appointed by the French government.      French Special Collectivity      New Caledonia, located in the South Pacific, was formerly a French Overseas Territory, but gained special status in 1999 following the Nouméa Accord in 1998. The French government is represented in New Caledonia by the high commissioner and two deputies are also elected to the National Assembly in Paris.",French Overseas Possessions  Attractions in French Overseas Possessions,caribbean,,
zambia,"Vast lakes and wetlands, long and life-giving rivers, breathtaking African sunsets and a rich tradition of guiding all contribute to Zambia’s immense appeal as a safari destination.      Its most famous landmark, Victoria Falls, which it shares with Zimbabwe, attracts nature lovers and thrill-seekers alike. Visit in March or April, when the falls are in full spate, and you’ll be bowled over by the rainbows, the roar of the cascading water and the dense, drenching clouds of spray.      Livingstone, the closest urban hub to the falls and once Zambia’s colonial capital, has a number of accommodation options, colourful markets and a busy restaurant and nightlife scene. The mighty Zambezi River itself is glassy-smooth above the falls and wild below. It’s perfect for booze cruises, canoe safaris and adrenaline activities such as white-water rafting and river surfing. There are a plethora of beautiful riverside lodges dotted along its banks.      Beyond the falls, Zambia is not as high-profile a safari destination as Kenya, Tanzania or South Africa, but it’s a favourite with those in the know. Packed with untamed wilderness and fascinating wildlife, minus the crowds, Zambia is the African bush at its most raw and romantic.      The country’s excellent safari lodges and camps will put you fully in touch with your wild surroundings. You’ll fall asleep to the hooting of owls, the whooping of hyenas, the distant roar of lions, and the loud munching of hippos grazing nearby.      Almost a third of Zambia’s landmass is given over to national parks and game reserves, but South Luangwa National Park is the cream of the crop for sheer density of big game. It’s also the home of the legendary African walking safari.      Another of Zambia’s drawcards is the people. The country is home to a staggering 72 different ethnic groups, each of whom have their own distinctive cultural traits and traditions, but all of whom are unfailingly warm and welcoming.","Zambia  Attractions in Zambia  Experience Kasanka National Park’s bat migration  This fascinating pocket of woodland is a conservation zone that’s in recovery after a long period of intense hunting and poaching. These days, it’s best known for antelopes, birds and bats. Every year between October and December, a staggering population (some says up to 10 millions) of fruit bats migrates into Kasanka. With the setting sun, they cover the skyline as they head out to feed, returning again at dawn.  Explore the fast-growing city of Lusaka  See the attractions in the booming capital, Lusaka, including the Kabwata Cultural Village where you'll find carvers at work, indigenous arts and crafts for sale, and entertainment from traditional dancers. The Lusaka National Museum covers ethnography, witchcraft, history and contemporary art. Lusaka's various bustling markets are its lifeblood, while the city also boasts a good restaurant and nightlife scene.  Get your adrenaline fix in Livingstone  Livingstone, formerly Zambia's capital city, is now well-established as Africa's adventure sports capital. Among other activities, thrillseekers can bungee jump off the 111m (364ft) bridge linking Zambia and Zimbabwe across the Zambezi River, while below Victoria Falls in Batoka Gorge lie some of the best white water rapids to be found anywhere in the world.  Go on a walking safari in South Luangwa National Park  The protected woodlands and grasslands beside the Luangwa River teem with wildlife and form one of southern Africa's best game-viewing regions. South Luangwa is Zambia's flagship national park and the undisputed home of the walking safari, a particularly exhilarating way to experience the African bush. Safaris here have an authentic, conservation-conscious feel, with excellent low-impact lodges and exceptional guides.  Marvel at Victoria Falls  The original Kololo name for the Victoria Falls is Mosi-oa-Tunya, 'the smoke that thunders'. At their highest, the falls drop 108m (345ft) from their basalt lip into the Batoka Gorge, almost twice as far as the Niagara Falls. The flow is most impressive between December and July, peaking in March and April, when the spray can be seen from miles away.  Meander along the mighty Zambezi River  The great body of the Zambezi River is a particularly appealing location for a guided canoe safari, especially within Lower Zambezi National Park. You may well see elephants on the banks as you paddle along. Your guide will point out birds and keep a careful watch for hippos. The Zambezi is also a hotspot for tiger fishing.  Revel in colonial nostalgia at Shiwa Ngandu  This extravagant and incongruous manor house, the former home of a British colonial officer, overlooks a lake and is surrounded by pristine gardens. It gives a number of fascinating insights into both the eccentricity and determination of its creator and the colonial heritage of Zambia in general. There's also an idyllic natural hot spring just down the road.  Spy the strange shoebill at Bangweulu Swamps  The marshy shores of Lake Bangweulu, north of Kasanka National Park in northern Zambia, are an important habitat for shoebills, a large, unusual-looking stork which catches fish by lunging with its huge bill at lightning speed. The best months to see them are May and June.  Take it easy on Lake Kariba  Relax for a week on a luxurious houseboat on the world's largest reservoir, Zambia's equivalent of the French Riviera. The Zambian side of the lake is considerably quieter than the Zimbabwean side, but both are beautiful. You can drift along the banks, explore the islands or just admire the magnificent sunsets, drink in hand.  Watch wildlife in Kafue National Park  Enjoy spectacular wildlife watching in Kafue, the second largest national park in the world. Known for its beauty and scenic variety, this underexplored park is bisected by the Kafue River, which attracts hundreds of species of birds as well as herbivores and their predators. You can explore the park on game drives, guided bushwalks and riverboat trips.",africa,,
dominica,"The Caribbean island of Dominica is a natural treasure. Visitors will find a medley of brooding volcanic peaks, gushing mountain streams, dense forests, quiet lakes and spouting geysers. As you might have already guessed, it's a diverse and beautiful land.  Given its natural assets and warm and welcoming locals, Dominica should be a bustling tourism hotspot. Despite being one of the poorest in the region, crime is relatively low. But a marked lack of pumping nightlife, no direct flights to Dominica from the UK and little in the way of sandy beaches all mean it remains off the radar for many travellers. And yet this is what makes the island so appealing for the intrepid few.  Those partial to hiking amid thick tropical rainforest and gazing at bubbling lakes, will find this sunny green isle has many charms. In fact, much of Dominica is the domain of sprawling jungle, making it ideal for trekking. Adventuring your way around Dominica's natural delights is very much a primordial experience. On your travels through red mud trails and over undulating volcanic slopes, you'll find thundering waterfalls, hot springs where you can let nature heal your aches and pains, and even swim through a narrow gorge. Explore colourful coral reef with your snorkelling gear, be buoyed by bubbling volcanic water and visit the rawest spas imaginable – Dominica has so much to offer.  Perhaps the most attractive thing about the island, though, is the very thing that keeps the hordes away. Dominica has avoided mass tourism, and as a haven where Mother Nature is in charge, unspoilt by human hands. Having been both a French and British colony, the 70,000 or so inhabitants have various roots, including the indigenous Caribs, though the people are largely African in origin. As for visitors, they see Dominica as an unblemished alternative to the more commercial Caribbean islands. Here you can get away from the crowds, welcomed by the friendliest of local populations.","Dominica  Attractions in Dominica  Buckle up for a jeep safari  Explore Dominica's hidden reaches by jeep and experience a tranquil contrast to bustling Roseau. Once you've arrived at some of the more remote spots, you can scour forests for birdlife and marvel at vibrant tropical blooms nestling amongst rock crevices and moss-covered scrub.  Delve into the Central Forest Reserve  This beautiful reserve is home to a vast population of gommier trees whose wood has provided building and craft material to Caribs for hundreds of years. Visitors can drive through the reserve, which was established in 1952, and enjoy the surrounding greenery, lakes and rivers.  Dive into crystalline water  The warm waters of Dominica are perfect for scuba diving and snorkelling, especially at Soufrière, where dramatic volcanic cliffs tumble into the sea. Visibility is excellent with some of the best, lesser-known snorkelling spots reached by kayaking along the coast.  Feel the heat at Boiling Lake  The Morne Trois Pitons National Park is home to the Boiling Lake: a steaming basin of bubbling liquid found at an altitude of 762m (2,500ft). Only reachable by foot, it is highly recommended that anyone undertaking the 7-mile journey from Laudat is accompanied by a guide.  Follow the L'Escalier Tête Chien  L'Escalier Tête Chien (which, in French Creole, means ""Stairway of the Snake's Head"") is an impressive rock formation jutting out into the Atlantic, and is found in the Carib Territory. It's perhaps one of the most sacred sites on the whole island.  Go whale watching  The waters surrounding Dominica are teeming with marine life, most notably cetaceans. Sperm whales, pilot whales and pygmy whales all glide around the coast, as do Atlantic and spotted dolphins. Dominica is the only country in the world where the sperm whale stays all year long, although sightings are most common between November and March.  Have a bath at Soufriere Sulphur Springs  If Dominica's balmy climate isn't hot enough for you, take a dip in these sultry springs. Locals believe the water here has healing properties and some Dominicans even sip small amounts of it to cleanse themselves. We don't recommend that, but we do recommend a dip in the springs, which leave bathers feeling revitalised.  Hike in Morne Trois Pitons National Park  Stretch your legs amid the lush greenery, towering trees and exotic foliage in Morne Trois Pitons National Park. With its steep slopes and deep valleys, visitors can stumble upon hot springs, freshwater lakes and five volcanoes. The park presents a heady mix of natural features, which earned it a place on UNESCO's list of World Heritage Sites.  Hit the beach  You don't have to travel far to find a good beach in Dominica. For the archetypal Caribbean experience head to the north, where gentle waves lap onto white, sandy shores. Once a hangout for pirates, Pointe Baptiste is a gateway to one of the island's best black beaches, which offers a pleasant change. If for some reason you don't like feeling the sand between your toes, head to the rocky shores of Castle Bruce Beach.  Make a day trip to Trafalgar Falls  Dominica's most popular waterfall is incredibly beautiful and many flock to see it cascade down the rocks. After heavy rains the falls get pretty powerful and the rocks are dangerously slippery, so take care if you do decide to take a dip.  Meet Dominica’s indigenous inhabitants  Home to the last remaining indigenous community in the Caribbean, the Carib Territory offers a rare glimpse into the lives of Dominica’s original inhabitants. Renowned for their canoe-building skills, the Caribs' long, pointed vessels are hewn from the trunk of a gommier tree and lucky visitors may be able to witness craftsman at work using age-old carving techniques.  Relax in Roseau  With its friendly locals and sea views, Dominica's pretty capital is a fine place to while away a day or two. Join in the hubbub of the lively downtown area or kick back in the beautiful Botanical Gardens. The city's colourful streets are home to a stellar selection of bars and restaurants, which keep appetites sated and booties shaking.  Show your Carnival colours  With February comes Carnival: two weeks of raucous revelry culminating in a wild costume parade. Expect sequin dresses, feather masks and skimpy outfits aplenty, plus street jugglers, prancing musicians and marching drummers, all of which are lapped up by a cheering crowd of merrymakers.  Swim in the Emerald Pool  Waters appear green in the leafy light of Emerald Pool, which is one of the most tranquil spots in Morne Trois Pitons National Park. The cool waters of this pool come from a gentle waterfall, which provides an invigorating shower for bathers.  Visit Cabrits Historical Park  On the Cabrits Peninsula find the fine ruins of Fort Shirley and Fort George, which date back to the 18th century. There's a small museum near the entrance, which features collections of artefacts discovered on the site, and various jungle trails nearby.",caribbean,,
cayman islands,"Ask people to define their idea of paradise and they may well describe the Cayman Islands, a Caribbean archipelago renowned for its beautiful beaches, world-class diving and incredible food.      Mere specs in the Caribbean Sea, the Caymans are made up of three islands in all: Grand Cayman, Cayman Brac and Little Cayman. These British Overseas Territories are home to around 50,000 people, a significant number of whom are British expatriates working in everything from finance and property to scuba diving and services.      A trip to the Caymans is all about switching off. The extraordinary beaches on all three islands are perfect for whiling away lazy days, whilst the surrounding waters are a treasure trove of marine life, making them a hit with divers.      The financial industry looms large over the islands and there’s no income tax, leading many to believe that paradise really does exist here. Still, the high duty on consumer goods, food and fuel makes the cost of living sharply felt.      If you've got the cash, there’s an exceptional selection of high-end restaurants scattered across the archipelago – more than 200 on Grand Cayman alone. Island cuisine is also celebrated at Cayman Cookout, an annual culinary jamboree that attracts chefs from around the world. If that’s a bit highfalutin for you, then drop in at Taste of Cayman, which is a far more accessible food festival.      The jamborees come thick and fast throughout the winter months. Pirates Week celebrates local culture and the archipelago’s swashbuckling history, while Heritage Days allow visitors to sample local food, entertainment and history of the island in even more detail.      Another noteworthy jamboree is Batabano – the Cayman Islands’ own version of Carnival, complete with floats, extravagant costumes, steel bands and all the dancing you can muster. So pour out a glass of the local brew, Swanky, grab a spot on Seven Mile Beach, sit back and enjoy the show.","Cayman Islands  Attractions in Cayman Islands  Camana Bay  Restaurants, events, shopping, movies, music, business, fashion, sports, school – it's all here at a bespoke-built new town of Camana Bay (www.camanabay.com) which is ever growing. The 200 hectares (500 acres) of this extraordinary project are beautifully-designed from scratch. The effect is of a high-end, safe small US town where everything is within walking distance. You won't believe you're in the Caribbean when you stroll along the Paseo. The master plan is a multi-decade, multi-million pound project by Dart Realty.  Cayman Brac caves  The Bluff that runs along the centre of Cayman Brac is riddled with caves, many of them with tales to tell about the islanders who have sheltered there during hurricanes. One of the popular ones is Bat Cave, which for obvious reasons, is a photo opportunity in the making.  Cayman Motor museum  Believe it or not, Grand Cayman is home to the original Batmobile – one of nearly 90 cars at the privately-owned Cayman Motor museum (www.caymanmotormuseum.com). There's also one of the first cars ever produced, an 1886 Mercedes-Benz. Well worth a visit.  Cayman Turtle Farm  At this commercial turtle farm visitors can watch sea turtles at various stages of their development. There's also an artificial predator reef, a snorkelling lagoon, an aviary, a crocodile and a cultural centre. The farm has come under much fire for its high levels of government subsidy each year and there have also been doubts cast over the living conditions for the turtles. Ironically, even whilst you admire these noble, ancient creatures, you can do so from the Turtle Farm's own bar and restaurant – which serves turtle steaks, turtle burgers and turtle stew.  Experience the Atlantis Submarine  Delve beneath the deep completely wetsuit-free with the Atlantis Submarine (www.atlantisadventures.com), which offers hour-long trips to view the spectacular reefs. The submarine is fully kitted out for tourists and is unsinkable, fully-pressurised and suitable for all ages. It's a great way to get under the water without the hassle, expense and restrictions of gaining your PADI dive qualification.  Go Booby-spotting  Visit Booby Pond on Little Cayman, which hosts the world's largest colony of red-footed boobies. A natural, land-locked saltwater lagoon, it also has Magnificent Frigatebirds nesting around and was designated as a Wetland of International Significance in 1994. The visitor's centre is built in traditional Cayman style and is home to the National Trust. Over on the Brac, there's the Parrot Reserve which is home to the endangered Cayman Brac parrot. The Sister Islands are also home to the equally-endangered Rock Iguana.  Go fishing  The deep waters surrounding Grand Cayman are prime fishing grounds, offering various species of large fish. The annual International Fishing Tournament (www.fishcayman.com) takes place in April.  Hell  Go to Hell and back - literally. The peculiar rock formations of this area of Grand Cayman have evolved from shells and corals solidified by salt and lime deposits. A close examination reveals petrified forms of sea life that could be up to 20 million years old. There is a post office there which has one of the most unique local area stamps you will find. Look out for the devil himself – aka local shop owner, Ivan Farrington, replete in flame-red costume.  Hike the Mastic Trail  Hike through the mangrove swamps and ancient forest along Grand Cayman's Mastic Trail (www.nationaltrust.org.ky), linking Frank Sound to Old Man Bay. The trail dates back to the 18th century and passes through a variety of flora and fauna. This protected area represents some of the last remaining examples of Caribbean subtropical forest.  You may spot a native Cayman Green Parrot, Caribbean Dove, West Indian Woopdpecker, butterflies, lizards, frogs and more. Special tours are available and the trail takes approximately three hours. You will need to be reasonably fit to join this pedestrian route.  Miss Lassie’s House  This remarkable traditional Cayman home was the dwelling of one Gladwyn 'Miss Lassie' Bush, who began painting at age 62 after she had experienced a vision. Walls, windows, canvas are adorned with her intuitive art, which includes Biblical scenes as well as purely abstract patterns. The South Sound house is free to visit and tours of the wattle and daub house are available.  Mission House  In historic Bodden Town, which was Cayman's first capital, lies Mission House. It now serves as a museum portraying the history of the house, which was instrumental in bringing missionaries, teachers and more in the early years of the country. A historic – and beautiful - building in its own right, it is kept beautifully by the National Trust. Tours are available.  National Gallery  Local, American and British art is on display at the National Gallery of the Cayman Islands (www.nationalgallery.org.ky) in George Town. Now situated in an impressive multimillion pound new building, the gallery also puts on numerous events, openings, films, lectures and more.  National Museum  Learn the history of the islands in The Cayman Islands National Museum (www.museum.ky), George Town, where there are interactive exhibits and a good shop. The museum itself is a listed building which has over the years been used as a government house, prison and schoolhouse.  Pedro St James  This early 19th century plantation great house (www.pedrostjames.ky) and is set in beautiful grounds by the sea in Savannah. The oldest building in the Cayman Islands, it was the site of the 1831 proclamation ending slavery in the islands. It is also the 'birthplace of democracy' where the first governments sat. Pedro St. James is very popular for weddings and special events, including live music.  Reef diving the Kittiwake  Cayman's offshore reefs and walls - including Little Cayman's Bloody Bay Wall - are world renowned for diving (www.divecayman.ky). Various locations also offer wreck diving, particularly Cayman Brac, where a Russian warship was intentionally sunk in the late 1990s.  At the top end of Seven Mile Beach/North West Point lies the Kittiwake, an extraordinary 77m- (251ft-) vessel deliberately sunk in 2011 to serve as a dive site and artificial reef. The site is run by the Cayman Islands Tourism Association. It's both diver- and snorkeller-friendly, with excellent dive-throughs of the hyperbaric chambers, muster decks, crew quarters and a sense of grandeur. Ironically, the Kittwake originally served as a submarine rescue vessel.  Seven Mile Beach  The turquoise waters of Grand Cayman's West Bay are backed by the long, sandy Seven Mile Beach, and, while this is the main tourist centre and highly developed, this glorious stretch of coast retains its idyllic charms. As with all beaches in the Cayman Islands, the land up to the high water mark is public. Beware, therefore, of bars or restaurants asking for fees to use their beach. Hiring their loungers, yes. Paying for public beach? No deal. Snorkelling is wonderful in the stretch outside the Marriott hotel.  Snorkelling at Stingray City  Snorkel alongside southern stingrays at Stingray City in North Sound on Grand Cayman. These shallow waters are home to a profusion of stingrays and visitors can get right up close with these otherworldly, gentle creatures. As the story goes, when fishermen of yore cleaned their catch, they'd throw the unwanted innards overboard. Over a number of years, the stingrays came to associate the noise of the returning boats with a free feed and as a consequence both Deep Stingray City (near the reef) and the Sandbar have become popular sites for tourists. The stingrays aren't tame but are very used to visitors. They do have a barb which can sting if they are scared or provoked. Be aware that lifting them out of the water is considered cruel; stroke them gently along their fins and you'll get on just fine. They don't bite, but might leave you with a hard-to-explain hickey if you get too close. It is possible to feed them by hand.  Surfing  Need to polish up your board skills before hitting the beach? Learn to surf in a wave tank at Black Pearl Skate and Surf (www.blackpearl.ky), in Grand Harbour. Waves aren't going to be six-footers in Cayman because of the reef, but there are plenty of spots in the right weather.  Wander Queen Elizabeth II Botanic Park  Wander around the Queen Elizabeth II Botanic Park (www.botanic-park.ky), a 26-hectare (65-acre) heritage garden boasting a vivid array of cacti, shrubs and native flowers. The park has become the focus of a highly successful conservation programme to protect the endangered Cayman blue iguana which is constantly threatened both by new development leading to habitat loss and the invasive, non-indigenous, bigger, brasher green iguana.",caribbean,,
england,"Despite its small size, England remains stubbornly impossible to encapsulate in a neat sound bite. It's a delectable mosaic of cultures, cities and landscapes, and any holiday in England will add up to an experience that's much more than the sum of its parts.      Even the weather - despite many perceive that it rains a lot here, many cities across England are actually drier than a number of major European cities. Take London for example; Greenwich in London receives less average precipitation a year than Amsterdam, Hamburg and Paris; a fact that is hardly known. So England will have you doing an about-face on this and every other stereotype. Come expecting a nation of tea drinkers and pub goers, antiquated traditions and Sunday roasts – and leave knowing there's so much more to it than that.      When it comes to cities, London hardly requires an introduction because its reputation as a global cultural heavyweight is well-established, although England's regional cities warrant further attention. Though woven together by a shared history, these vibrant metropolises have fiercely individual characters and continue to make indelible marks on the fabric of this nation – and indeed the rest of the world.      The old industrial powerhouses of Birmingham, Liverpool and Manchester have made outstanding contributions to music (think Black Sabbath, The Beatles, Oasis) and continue to punch above their weight culturally. And then there are the grandiose seats of learning, Oxford and Cambridge, where medieval architecture and cobbled streets evoke a powerful sense of history at every turn.      England's eccentricities can bewilder (as a visit to the annual cheese rolling competition in Gloucestershire will prove), but despite the odd clash between tradition and modernity, the two make comfortable bedfellows. Visit England and you'll see a place where liberal values have fostered a culture of tolerance and diversity, where self-deprecation is the modus operandi and where witty words beat correct answers almost every time.      It's a country that rewards the curious, whether that means ducking into a pub for a chat with the locals or heading out into the wilds. Speaking of the wilds, England's landscapes have it all: from the dramatic dales of Yorkshire and the rugged fells of the Lake District, to the bucolic hills of the Cotswolds and Cornwall's dramatic coast. No wonder it's one of the world's most popular destinations.","England  Attractions in England  Alton: ride the roller coasters  Located near the village of Alton in Staffordshire is Alton Towers, one of the UK's most popular theme park, attracting young and old alike with its vast selection of whizzing rides and flashing attractions.

The 158m-tall (518ft) Blackpool Tower houses a ballroom, an aquarium and viewing deck and dominates the skyline along Blackpool's lively promenade.   Brighton: play on the pleasure pier  Shop around the bustling Laines in the bohemian seaside town of Brighton, before picking up some fish and chips and taking a long, shore-side stroll. Set in lavish gardens is the ornate former seaside home of George IV, Brighton's Royal Pavilion. On the beach Brighton Pier brims with life, while the burnt-out bones of the West Pier cut a forlorn figure.  Canterbury: wonder at the majestic Canterbury Cathedral  Canterbury Cathedral is a masterpiece of Romanesque and gothic architecture. Inside, visitors can see stained glass windows dating from the 12th century, the medieval tombs of King Henry IV and Edward the Black Prince, as well as those of numerous archbishops including Thomas Becket, who was murdered in the northwest transept in 1170.  Cornwall: walk the causeway to St Michael's Mount  Perched proudly on a rocky island, St Michael's Mount is one of Cornwall's best-known attractions. The monastery site dates back to as early as the 8th century, and legend claims it was constructed by a giant called Cormoran. The castle is open to the public year round and at low tide it's possible to walk the causeway to reach it. Check local tide times first.  Derbyshire Dales: experience the high life at Chatsworth House  Visit the opulent Chatsworth House, possibly England's finest country home. Set in the Peak District of Derbyshire, among sculptures, parks and woodland full of deer, this stately home was once used as a prison by Elizabeth I. The seat of the Duke of Devonshire, the house is an insight into British aristocracy through the ages.  Devon: delight in Devonshire cream tea  Clear the cobwebs on a blustery walk along the spectacularly rugged North Devon Coast and explore its spectacular castles and coves. If you are feeling brave enough, try a spot of surfing, before sating your appetite with a delicious Devonshire cream tea – a pot of tea drunk with a combination of scones, clotted cream and jam.  Lake District: stroll, swim and sail  The Lake District National Park in Cumbria is a popular tourist destination with numerous stunning walking trails. Spanning 18km (11 miles) in length and plunging to a depth of 66m (219ft), Lake Windermere is the largest lake in England and a hub for boating activities and water sports.  Liverpool: find the Fab Four and much more  Liverpool is a city transformed. Once the butt of Scouser jokes and stereotypes, it's now a flourishing cultural hub. The arrival of the Tate art gallery, the waterfront and Albert Dock regeneration and the Museum of Liverpool have reshaped the city's reputation. A must-see attraction is the Cavern Club where the Beatles first performed.  London: rove England's greatest city  Britain's capital is one of the world’s greatest. Visit a huge range of museums and galleries; melt the credit card in its shops and markets, and (over)indulge in a bounty of restaurants, bars, pubs and nightclubs. Look out over the city from the gigantic Shard building or spend an afternoon ogling the crown jewels in the Tower of London.  Maidstone: discover the illustrious past of Leeds Castle  Located in Mainstone, Kent (rather than the northern city it shares a name with), Leeds Castle is built on two islands in a lake. Over the centuries, six medieval queens and Henry VIII have called the castle home. Famed for its aviary, which includes black swans, the castle features fine art and tapestries as well as a maze, vineyard and Culpeper Garden outside.  Oxford: study the sights  Oxford is one of the most important seats of learning in England, and Oxford University is the oldest university in the English-speaking world, having existed since the 11th century. The vast student population ensures Oxford maintains an impressive nightlife scene and is full of cosmopolitan zeal.  Poole: learn the harbour's pirate past  Poole Harbour is a vibrant quay on England's southern coast that bustles with an array of bars, cafes and restaurants. Follow the Cockle Trail to discover myths and legends about Poole's smugglers and ghosts of yesteryear, culminating at the Waterfront Museum. Adventure-seekers can try watersports in and around the harbour or take a ferry to the National Trust's Brownsea Island.  Southwold: see a traditional British seaside town  Situated on the north Suffolk coastline, Southwold is a traditional seaside town that forms part of the Suffolk Heritage Coast. With its brightly painted beach huts, working lighthouse, harbour and bustling fish markets, Southwold is a quintessential English resort town of yesteryear without the brashness of a pleasure beach.  Stonehenge: a world famous prehistoric monument  Erected between 3000 and 1600 BCE, Stonehenge is a giant stone circle that stands on Salisbury Plain and is one of the most famous surviving sites from the ancient world. Marvel at the stones and the ingenuity of the construction; the interactive visitor centre has various theories about how the structure came to be and houses over 250 prehistoric treasures.  Stratford-upon-Avon: see some Shakespeare  Catch a performance by the Royal Shakespeare Company at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon, the birthplace of William Shakespeare. Set on the banks of the River Avon, Stratford makes a delightfully picturesque setting for numerous festivals and events over the year, including a literary festival in April and a river festival in July.  Warwick: re-live history at Warwick Castle  Imagine life in the imposing Warwick Castle, first built by William the Conqueror in 1068, it is one of the best-preserved castles in England. See the castle come to life with mediaeval re-enactments, tours of the dungeons, and interactive experiences such as 'Dragon Slayer'.  Windsor: visit royalty at Windsor Castle  Windsor Castle is one of the homes of Queen Elizabeth II and is the largest and oldest occupied castle in the world. Painstakingly restored after severe fire damage, the castle has been continuously inhabited by Britain's monarchs since its construction by William I. The remains of numerous British sovereigns lie here too including Henry VIII, Charles I and George V.  York: admire architecture and art  With its medieval architecture, magnificent minster (northern Europe's largest church) and ancient city walls, York demands a stop on any English itinerary.

You can drive up the USA’s oldest manmade attraction, the Mt Washington Auto Road, pedal through covered bridges and white-clapboard villages, wear out your phone battery snapping autumn leaves, or gaze up at star-sprinkled skies.      New Hampshire’s thickly forested mountains, crystalline lakes and sugary beaches are a magnet for outdoor adventurers. The long-distance Appalachian Trail snakes through the state, or you can choose from 1,900km (1,200 miles) of hiking paths in the White Mountains National Forest.      Find your Zen on the water with a stand-up paddleboarding yoga class on Lake Winnipesaukee or meet rapids head-on via kayak on the Magalloway River, home to ospreys, moose and black bears. In winter, skiers and riders rip it up at Cannon Mountain or down the backcountry slopes of Tuckerman Ravine. If that’s not challenging enough pack an ice axe and claw your way up frozen rock faces.      While New Hampshire’s coast may be minute, what it lacks in size it makes up for in sandy shores and gently pounding surf. Hampton Beach dishes up old-school seaside entertainment with its sweeping sands, picturesque boardwalk, weekly fireworks and summer concerts.      If you’re craving a little culture, the Currier Museum of Art in Manchester shows work by the likes of Monet, Picasso and O’Keefe, and runs tours of the fabulous Frank Lloyd Wright-designed Zimmerman House. Thirsty? You’re in luck. Nano-breweries are opening faster than you can pour your first pint, and New Hampshire makes a pretty mean honey wine too. Cheers to that.","New Hampshire  Attractions in New Hampshire  Appalachian Trail  Hike the Appalachian Trail or ride the aerial tramway at Cannon Mountain in Franconia Notch State Park (www.franconianotchstatepark.com). See the dramatic 13km (8-mile) gorge formed by glacial action during the ice age.  Cog Railway  Take the Cog Railway (www.thecog.com) ride to the top of Mount Washington to enjoy panoramic views of Canada and the three neighbouring states. Enjoy the sights and sounds of this steam-driven locomotive on the world's first mountain cog railway, in operation since 1869.  Go skiing  Hit the ski slopes (www.skinh.com) on any of the state's 19 downhill resorts, or enjoy cross-country trails through scenic forests.  Lake Winnipesaukee  Enjoy every imaginable outdoor activity on Lake Winnipesaukee (www.lakewinnipesaukee.net). The crystal clear spring-fed lake, surrounded by three mountain ranges and dotted with over 300 islands, has a wooded shoreline and is ideal for camping, hiking, fishing, boating and swimming.

vanuatu,"If you can confidently point to Vanuatu on a map then you’re a better geographer than most. Drifting like flotsam in the Pacific Ocean, this little-known nation has much to offer intrepid travellers and is all the more appealing for its obscurity.      Made up of approximately 83 islands, the geologically active archipelago is a natural playground of colourful coral reefs, bubbling volcanoes and lush rainforest. Visitors can drive up to the crater of Yasur, cited as the most accessible active volcano in the world, sea kayak round the islands' sandy shores, explore underwater WWII relics, or hike and bike through coconut plantations and steamy jungles.      Those less disposed to physical exertion can always while away lazy days on Vanuatu’s bountiful beaches, which really are the picture of tropical island idyll. Or why not charter a boat and hop from one island to the next? Wherever you go expect a good feast: the food here is absolutely exquisite, a testament not only to talented local chefs, but also the profusion of fresh ingredients that grow on this fertile archipelago.      Warm and welcoming, with a rich and sometimes mysterious traditional culture, the ni-Vanuatu people greet visitors as friends and are keen to share stories about their country, which was declared the happiest nation on the planet in 2006. The Happy Planet Index hasn’t bestowed this title on Vanuatu since, but it’s still pretty jovial by all accounts.      Tourism in Vanuatu is largely centred on the islands of Tanna, Espiritu Santo and Efaté, with most international visitors arriving on the latter. From here it is easy to travel by boat or plane to the rest of the country, which caters for travellers of all stripes. Sure, it’s skewered to the well heeled, but amongst the high-end beach resorts are a smattering of wallet friendly options. Proof that paradise needn’t break the bank.","Vanuatu  Attractions in Vanuatu  Bathe beneath the waterfalls  Whether you take an organised tour or catch the local bus, the Mele Cascade waterfall is only 15 minutes from Port Vila. The best views are directly below, so pack bathers and enjoy the swimming around the plunge pools. Following cyclone Pam and the subsequent closure of Edge Adventure, visitors cannot currently abseil down the falls.  Dare to look at the lava, Yasur  Drive to the summit of the world's most accessible active volcano, Yasur, on Tanna Island. Peer into the crater at a seething mass of bubbling lava. You can also learn about the John Frum cargo cult; it began with the arrival of an American soldier in WWII, and believers now wait for him to return to the island with great riches.  Drive a dune buggy on an off-road tour  Adventure operators run tours from Port Vila, so jump in a dune buggy and get off-road and dirty. Follow the leader in convoy as you power along a black sand beach, through forest tracks by way of some local villages. The most adventurous should tackle this tour if there has been some rain. Embrace it – you will get very muddy.   Gasp at the Naghol  Every Saturday from April to June, Pentecost Island holds the world famous Naghol (""land dive"").  The forerunner to bungee jumping, this traditional festival involves men diving from 100m-high (328ft) towers with only vines tied around their ankles. The Naghol is a celebration of the yam harvest and is a fertility rite for men.  Go wreck diving at Espiritu Santo Island  Discover James A Michener's inspiration for South Pacific, Espiritu Santo Island. Here, scuba divers can see the liner President Coolidge and the destroyer USS Tucker rest on the seabed, and explore Million Dollar Point where military equipment was dumped at the end of the war. The snorkelling is also excellent at one of Vanuatu's most scenic islands.  Haul a catch with deep-sea fishing  With marlin, wahoo, swordfish and tuna, Vanuatu offers some of the best deep-sea fishing in the South Pacific, and game fishing tournaments are held throughout the year. For smaller catches reef fishing is also available and boats for both depart from Port Vila Harbour. Take to Espiritu Santo for the best in-shore fishing trips.   Seek out Hideaway Island Marine Sanctuary  Located just off Mele Bay, Hideaway Island is a resort that features excellent offshore snorkelling, a fine restaurant and the world's only underwater post office – complete with waterproof postcards. Day-trippers are welcome to this marine sanctuary to enjoy the snorkel safari and scuba dives.  Spot dolphins from your sailboat  Set sail in search of dolphins aboard the Coongoola. The lovely timber ketch departs from Havannah Harbour and takes passengers to the turtle sanctuary on Tranquillity Island (Moso) for a beach barbecue and spot of snorkelling. If the wind is favourable you return under sail and there is a good chance of being joined by dolphins off the bow.  Try the national dish at the Mama's Market  Seek out the harbour-front markets in Port Vila where a wonderful array of fruit, vegetables and flowers await. Mama's Market is run by local women and is the best place on the island to sample the national dish, lap lap (cooked yam roots with coconut cream and meat). Further along the handicraft market sells carvings, sarongs and other items of clothing, ideal for souvenirs.  Understand local traditions at Ekasup Cultural Village  Ekasup Cultural Village is 10 minutes from Port Vila and it explains Vanuatu's traditional village life, medicines, food, dancing and hunting methods (like how to catch fish with a spider's web). Local men, women and children participate, so the traditional culture is passed through the generations. Tours run twice a day (except Sundays) and Friday night is Melanesian Feast night.  Understand the cultures of each island  The Vanuatu Museum & Cultural Centre is opposite Parliament house, near the Chief's Nakamal (meeting place). There are permanent displays of traditional artefacts, pottery, fossils, masks and slit-gongs on show to reflect the diversity of culture and history on the various islands. As well as daily video screenings, the centre hosts vibrant temporary exhibits and performances (sand-drawing, bamboo flute, traditional dance and story-telling).  Unearth history at The Secret Garden  Located in Mele, The Secret Garden offers the chance to learn about the local flora and fauna, explore thatched huts from the various islands and see iguanas, pythons and flying foxes. It presents a quirky look at Vanuatu's history including missionaries, cannibalism and traditional customs, as well as the more serious subjects of blackbirding and WWII.  View Vanuatu from a helicopter above  See the serene South Pacific islands from above with a seaplane or helicopter flight. Both operate on the island with a number of flights available from short scenic flyovers, trips to a private island for a Robinson Crusoe-esque picnic or to one of the out-of-town restaurants for lunch. The helicopter is also great for aerial photography opportunities.",oceania,,
taiwan,"Sitting pretty as one of Asia’s best-kept travel secrets, the spicy, scenic island of Taiwan makes a habit of smashing visitor preconceptions.      Outsiders tend to see this country as notable only for its technological prowess – an image reinforced by the global prominence of ‘Made in Taiwan’ stickers – but in reality this is a destination that serves up awe-inspiring panoramas, a rainbow of different cultures and a startlingly rich history.      Alongside night markets, cycle trails and hot springs, there are gleaming skyscrapers, hulking mountains and sparkling lakes. When you factor in the manageable size of the island, which is less than half the size of Scotland, the appeal becomes even more significant.      Taiwan is one of the few places on Earth where ancient religious and cultural practices still thrive in an overwhelmingly modernist landscape. This juxtaposition is expressed most clearly in Taipei, where futuristic marvels like Taipei 101 – one of the tallest buildings in the world – share the city with incense-fogged temples and indigenous communities.      This mix of different influences is wonderfully showcased by the island’s cuisine – a lip-smacking blend of Chinese, Japanese and aboriginal fare.      Like many aspects of life in Taiwan, its diverse cuisine makes sense when you look at the island’s history. Following five decades of Japanese rule, in 1949 a liberated Taiwan became a refuge for the Chinese Nationalist Party and their supporters, who fled here during the Chinese Civil War. To this day, Taiwan remains a product of this period – a maverick sovereign state still viewed with uneasiness by Beijing.      History buff or not, there’s much to enjoy in Taiwan. Away from the sleek towers of the cities, it’s the valleys, lakes and gorges of the countryside that tend to leave the greatest impression. The fact that comparatively few tourists make it here is more to do with a lack of awareness than a lack of things to do – hikers, cyclists, divers, surfers, pilgrims and gourmands will all find a little slice of heaven in this corner of Asia.","Taiwan  Attractions in Taiwan  Admire the artefacts at the National Palace Museum  A few hours in Taipei's National Palace Museum should be essential for anyone with even a remote interest in the region's cultural heritage. It showcases the world's largest and most exquisite collection of Chinese artefacts, the majority of which came over with Chiang Kai-Shek's supporters, much to the continued chagrin of Beijing. Truly unmissable.  Bring out the binoculars for a spot of birdwatching  Taiwan is home to about 460 different species of birds, including rare endemic species such as the brilliantly vibrant Formosan blue magpie, the orange punk-haired flamecrest and the Mikado and Swinhoe's Pheasants. Other wildlife includes the famous fanged Formosan rock-monkey, and about 400 species of butterflies.  Dive the corals of Ludao (Green Island)  Dive or snorkel in the waters around Ludao (Green Island), off the southeast coast: there are splendid forests of corals to admire, and, what's more, visibility is good all-year-round. The island is accessible by boat from Taitung and is famous for the political prisoners that were exiled here in the 20th century.  Drive the outstanding northeast coastal road  Take a memorable drive along the northeast coastal road, which gives spectacular panoramas of the foothills of the Central Mountain Range and the blue expanse of the East China Sea and Pacific Ocean. The route passes through a large number of small villages, many of them little changed since the advent of high technology.  Feast on the delectable sites at Taroko Gorge  Take time to marvel at the scale of Taroko Gorge, Taiwan's most iconic natural attraction and a worthy inclusion on any itinerary. The ravine's towering cliffs are shot through with extensive marble deposits, contributing to the overall beauty of one of the Far East's most striking sights.  Hike Taiwain's jewel, Yushan (Jade Mountain)  Many of Taiwan's national parks offer top-notch hiking, but dramatic Yushan is the pick of the bunch. This is largely thanks to Mount Yushan (Jade Mountain) itself; at 3,952m (12,966ft) it is the highest peak in North East Asia. It's an important symbol of Taiwan's identity and a favourite target for mountain climbers.  Join in the Chinese New Year celebrations  Join in the celebrations for one of many festivals taking place in the capital, and gain an insight into the island's culture. The Dragon Boat Festival and the Mid-Autumn Moon Festival are both colourful affairs but it is the lanterns and fireworks of the Chinese New Year that really bring the streets to life.  Marvel at the massive, Chung Tai Chan Monastery  The world's tallest Buddhist temple, this epic feat of architecture took more than 10 years to construct and was designed by C.Y. Lee, the man behind Taipei 101. It's best accessed from the town of Puli in central Taiwan, and is notable among other things for its impressive blend of modernist techniques and old-world traditions.  Raft down the East Rift Valley  Discover the East Rift Valley, Taiwan's largest fault line. Known locally as ""the land of milk and honey"", the rich sediment makes it a geologist's paradise. With stunning scenery featuring clear streams, lakes and verdant valleys, the area is popular for adventurers. Raft down the Xiuguluan River for unforgettable views.  Relax in a Taian hot spring  Taiwan's volcanic past has left abundant reserves of geothermal energy all over the island, and there are well over 100 hot mineral springs scattered around the country. They're hugely popular with both locals and tourists, and offer an indulgent way of soothing tired muscles. Arguably the best are in Taian in the north of the island.  Relax with a recreational visit to Kenting National Park  Chill out for a day or two in Kenting National Park, a much-visited forest recreation area boasting glorious beaches, coral lakes and a bird sanctuary, as well as facilities for watersports and golf, all set amidst tropical coastal forest. The park occupies the extreme southern tip of Taiwan.  Ride the wind at the Penghu archipelago  Admire the astonishing basalt rock formations of the Penghu archipelago, a group of islands in the middle of the Taiwan Straits. The columns were formed when lava erupting from deep into the earth cooled and contracted, and were then carved by wave and wind erosion. The breeze almost makes Penghu a popular windsurfing destination.  Soar above Luye Plateau  Taiwan's precipitous terrain and steady winds offer perfect opportunities for hang-gliding and paragliding. Green Bay on the North Shore and the Luye Plateau in Taitung County in the southeast offer inspiring scenery for gliders to soar over. Tandem glides are ideal for all skill levels.  Spot a pickled python at Snake Alley (Taipei)  Gawp at live snakes, pickled pythons and other oddities at Taipei's Huahsi Night Market. Known locally as Snake Alley, this is more than just a gimmick for tourists – the various products, including snake testicles and turtle penises, are believed to promote virility and are available to buy.  Take in the vistas atop Taipei 101  Admire the view from the top of Taipei 101, which until 2010 was the world's tallest building. You can take a lift (the fastest of its kind in the world) up to The Observatory on the top floor for the ultimate city vista. It's more than twice the size of the next tallest building in Taipei.  Tour the temples of Tainan  Visit Tainan, the oldest city on the island and the former capital. It's known as the ""City of 100 Temples"", but there are in fact 220, including some of the best examples of Confucian temple architecture in Taiwan. Expect ancient monuments, lip-smacking food and a packed calendar of celebrations including the Yenshui Firework Festival.  Uncover the Yami tribe of Lanyu (Orchid Island)  Learn about the aboriginal Yami, one of the world's last surviving hunter-gatherer tribes, on their island, Lanyu (Orchid Island). Off the southeast coast, the volcanic island is also home to some of the finest coral reef in the region and offers a peaceful taste of the tropics, even in peak season.  Visit the imposing Chiang Kai-Shek Memorial Hall  Climb one of the two staircases to the Chiang Kai-Shek Memorial Hall, an imposing tomb and shrine to Taipei's most famous leader.  A national landmark, the monument also houses Taipei's main venues for the performing arts, the National Theatre and National Opera House, in its large grounds.  Walk behind the ramparts at Kinmen  An archipelago of islands located just 2km (1.2 miles) off the coast of mainland China (but still under Taiwanese rule), Kinmen represents one of the most fascinating – and little-known – options of a trip to Taiwan. As a pivotal strategic base during the unrest of the 20th century, it remains heavily fortified.  Wander through the traditional town of Lugang (Lukang)  A character-rich old port town in central Taiwan, Lugang is home to a wealth of traditional buildings and great places to pick up authentic local crafts.  The historic centre is an enjoyable spot through which to wander but make sure not to miss three of the country's most atmospheric temples, Longshan, Matsu and Glass Matsu.",asia,,
guam,"Guam is a vibrant, tropical paradise, complete with powdery beaches, and coral reefs teeming with underwater life. Away from the beach, find historic buildings in the bustling capital, Hagåtña, swinging nightlife in Tumon and a melting pot of Asian, European, Pacific Rim and American cultures.  Those looking to get active can lace up those walking boots and climb Mount Lam Lam, or hop on a jet ski and whizz over the surrounding crystal clear waters. Guam is the largest and most southerly island of the Marianas Islands and has been an important US strategic base since World War II.  The most populated island in Micronesia, this unincorporated US territory is full of American accents, and sadly the Chamorro language is less spoken today than it once was. Glamorous, modern Tumon Bay is where most of the hotels are, and it's pretty commercial with duty-free shopping being the order of the day.  There is much more to Guam, though. It's a thoroughly multicultural island for one thing, and Chamorro culture is starting to be pushed more than it has been in recent decades. There are many pretty villages to explore, while a singular local cuisine is being celebrated more.  If you leave Tumon Bay behind, you'll find Guam full of rustic settlements, with many immaculate, secluded beaches, and a few glorious waterfalls. Don't pass up opportunities to meet the locals on your travels, either, who are known for their charm and warmth towards visitors, and are increasingly passionate about making their traditional culture as prominent as it used to be.  The US' somewhat overbearing presence in Guam is perhaps best typified by its military base, which dominates the north of the island. Even so, the area harbours a spectacular coastline of palm trees and turquoise waters, so don't miss it.","Guam  Attractions in Guam  Discover a world of watersports  Guam's beautiful waters lend themselves to an array of water-based activities, including jet skiing, windsurfing, kayaking and fishing. A recent addition to the watersports scene is snuba diving, which combines the freedom of snorkeling with scuba. Or enjoy seeing marine life using a Seawalker, which is a unique helmet filled with air.  Explore Guam’s underwater world  One of the world's leading dive destinations, underwater attractions include WWII wrecks, colourful coral reefs and marine life aplenty. Lucky divers may spot the spinner dolphin, which inhabits the island's shallow bays. The island also has plenty of reputable dive schools, which are perfect for beginners.  Get back to nature in Gef Pago Park  This living museum in Inarajan Village focuses on the traditions and lifestyle of the Chamorros. Demonstrations reveal how natives made sea salt, wove rope and how coconut was more than just food; husks served as insect repellent, fire starters and insulation.  Get close, but not too close to Two Lovers Point  Local legend says that two, star-crossed lovers leapt 115m (378ft) to their deaths from this vantage point. We don't suggest you do the same, of course, but we do highly recommend you check out this vantage point's fine views of Tumon Bay.  Learn about Guam’s tumultuous history  The South Pacific Memorial Park, just outside Hagåtña, commemorates those killed in WWII, and the nearby War in the Pacific National Historical Park is the location of five battle sites with a museum exhibiting war photos and relics. Guam Museum is also well worth a visit: its exhibits showcase Chamorro culture and tell the story of Sgt. Shoichi Yokoi, a Japanese soldier, who hid in rural Guam until 1972, unaware the war was over.  Relax in Latte Stone Park  Explore the crumbling remains of the ancient Chamorro people, which sit in the manicured surrounds of Latte Park. Other notable green spaces include Merizo Pier Park, in the south, which has fine views across the ocean. It's also worth venturing to the dark sands of Talofofo Bay Beach Park, which is located at the mouth of the Talofofo River and is renowned for its surf.  See the Spanish legacy in Hagåtña  Spain ruled Guam for 333 years and Hagåtña, the capital, has many colonial buildings in the charming old town. The city is an unlikely foodie hotspot, with many fine restaurants, while the city's pubs, cocktail bars and clubs cater for hedonists. Culturally, there are a number of attractions nearby including Guam Museum.  See the view from Apra Harbour  From this vantage point, one glimpses the harbour just like the Japanese soldiers did when the Americans invaded the island. A commemorative monument lists those who died during the three-year Japanese occupation. Today the harbour is a busy cruise and cargo ship port.  Stroll around the Namo Falls Botanical Garden  The Namo Fall Botanical Gardens in Agat is a popular spot for some wild swimming. Bathers can paddle in pools beneath two waterfalls, called Guella and Guello (""grandmother"" and ""grandfather""). If you don't fancy getting wet, take a stroll through the beautiful botanical gardens, which abounds with orchids, bougainvillea, mango trees and much more.  Take a hike  For the best views of the island climb Mount Lamlam, which is the highest point on Guam at 406m (1,334ft). And here's a bit of trivia for you to consider on the way up: the distance between the summit and nearby Mariana Trench is the greatest elevation change on Earth over such a short distance.  Visit WWII battle sites  This park consists of six different WWII battle sites where war relics, caves, foxholes and tunnels still exist. A must when visiting the park is the T Stell Newman Visitor Center, which features the award-winning movie, Liberating Guam: The U.S. Comes Back.",oceania,,
germany,"Misunderstood by many, Germany is one of the most varied and charming countries on the continent. Anyone expecting a homogenous nation conforming to old Teutonic stereotypes is in for a shock.      As a destination, it offers a clutch of truly lovely cities, culture served up in hefty portions and rural scenery so pretty you'll wonder why it isn't on every tourist hit list.      The country occupies a prime position at the heart of Europe – both literally and figuratively. It is home to the biggest economy on the continent, has more inhabitants than anywhere else in the EU and shares land borders with no less than nine other nations.      It's no surprise, then, that today's Germany is more diverse and cosmopolitan than old stereotypes suggest; mixing time-honoured traditions with multicultural modernism and self-confidence.      It’s the nation’s urban highlights that immediately draw the attention. Berlin is the definition of dynamism, having forged a good-time reputation for groundbreaking creativity while still keeping sight of its past.      Elsewhere, the likes of Cologne, Munich and Hamburg provide the capital with able support. Not only are they rich in history, whether in the forms of classical music, fine art or medieval architecture, but they also put pay to the notion that Germans don’t do gastronomy. These days, you can dine and drink extremely well in Deutschland.      Then there's the beautiful German countryside. From the sky-scraping peaks of the Bavarian Alps and pale cliffs of the Jasmund National Park to the castles of the Rhine and moors of the Mecklenburg Lake District, it's nirvana for hikers, cyclists, boaters, motorists and skiers alike.      Travelling around this country is a piece of Black Forest gâteau. Costs are manageable, overcrowding is rare and, despite its size, it could not be easier to get from A to B thanks to an incredibly efficient public transport network. Which proves some of those old German stereotypes do hold true.","Germany  Attractions in Germany  Bavarian Alps: adventure awaits  Forming a long natural divide along the Austrian border, the Bavarian Alps are a strikingly attractive spectacle. Take in the mountain views from the top of the Zugspitze. It's a panorama you will never forget. Easily reachable from Munich, outdoor enthusiasts will be in their element here with plenty of skiing, hiking and canoeing options. Those more intent on relaxation can unwind and unknot in a slew of top-notch spas.  Berlin: best for history and hedonism  Blessed with the Brandenburg Gate, Charlottenburg Palace and Reichstag building, Berlin is rich in history, including volatile marks from the 20th century like the Führer Headquarters, the Holocaust-memorial and Berlin Wall. But brightened by street art, sound-tracked by an underground dance scene and thriving creatively, modern Berlin shines for visitors too.  Black Forest: from cake to cuckoo clock  Few parts of Germany's countryside are as storied as the Black Forest: a dense, green mountain range in the southwest. Hiking is the best way to explore the photogenic beauty and sky-high peaks of this national park, while the forest is also home to a large number of small character-rich towns, including Triberg im Schwarzwald, which is home to the world's largest cuckoo clock. The famous Triberger waterfalls, close to Triberg, are the highest waterfalls in Germany. Although the dessert Black Forest gâteau is not directly named after the Black Forest mountain range, it does takes its name from the speciality liquor distilled from tart cherries in this region. The German name for Black Forest gâteau is Schwarzwälder Kirschtorte and the liquor is called  Schwarzwälder Kirsch(wasser).  Central Germany: walk the Rennsteig  With its mountain ranges, tidal shores and mighty forests, the size and scope of Germany makes it a hiker's paradise. The historical ridge trail known as the Rennsteig leads for some 170 km (106 miles) from Eisenach and the Werra valley to Blankenstein and the Selbitz river. It passes through forests and highlands in the centre of the country, and combines rich culture with even richer scenery.  Cologne: carnival is a must  Cologne knows how to have a good time and the Cologne carnival is one of the biggest events on the calendar. Expect lots of fancy dress, plenty of parties and parades. Also keep a lookout for ceremonial burning of straw figures, bouquets of flowers and cries of ""Kölle Alaaf"" (Long Live Cologne).  Dresden: a synonym for culture  WWII left Dresden in a sorrowful state, but the city recovered sufficiently to become the spirited and arty destination it is today. It is handsome too, thanks in part to the Dresden Frauenkirche church, which was resurrected beautifully and restored as the skyline-dominating feature it deserves to be. Other must sees in Dresden are the museums in the Zwinger and in the Grüne Gewölbe, as well as the masterpieces in the Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister.  Essen: escape the past in Essen  Crowned the European Capital of Culture in 2010, Essen has grown from a staid mining city into a remarkable example of how industrial infrastructure can be repurposed to artistic effect. Shaft 12 at Zollverein Coal Mine is now a Bauhaus-inspired and UNESCO-listed design museum, while the award of European Green Capital in 2017 is further proof that the city's industrial past has been truly usurped.  Frankfurt: search for its medieval core  Frankfurt is best known as a financial centre (its gleaming office-block skyline has been coined 'Mainhattan') but there's much to draw cultural tourists too. Its historic core dates back to medieval times and several attractive landmark buildings remain, while its local tipple, Ebbelwoi (applewine), should be experienced and enjoyed. The 13 museums at the Museumsufer in Frankfurt play an important role in the German and European museum sector. Particularly noteworthy are the arts and craft museum, the museum of ethnology and the film museum.  Hamburg: find the city's beating heart  As Germany's second largest metropolis, the northern port city of Hamburg offers rich pickings for tourists. Colourful and cosmopolitan, the city has music at its heart: retrace the steps of The Beatles along the Reeperbahn; enjoy the fervent live scene; or dance to DJs until the small hours. The Speicherstadt's neo-gothic canals are best explored at night. Or enjoy Hamburg's famous fair Hamburger Dom, which takes place in spring, summer and winter.  Heidelberg: fall in love with Germany's most romantic town  Boasting a glorious woodland setting on the broad Neckar River, Heidelberg draws large numbers of visitors for its formidable renaissance castle, cosy cafes and literature-culture with bookshops, poetry events and academic happenings. Germany's oldest university town is also the birthplace of German Romanticism and is famed for its picturesque panoramas along the riverside Philosophers' Walk (Philosophenweg).  Moselle Valley: sample some of the best Rieslings   Getting to know the world-famous wineries of the Moselle Valley is a rewarding way to sample rural Germany. The Moselle River flows through France, Luxembourg, and Germany where it twists and turns between Trier and Koblenz. Aside the steep banks of the river Moselle, the culture remains traditional, pace of life slow and its scenery grandly evocative. The wines, including some of the best Rieslings, are well worthy of extensive acquaintance.  Munich: enjoy a beer at Oktoberfest  First held in 1810, Munich's much eulogised festival is a 16-day celebration of Bavarian culture, with top billing afforded to local beers and belly-filling food. Expect fairground rides and live music too. However, if you're planning a visit, be aware that the majority of the festival falls in late September, despite its name.  Munich: watch a football match  Germany's love affair with football reaches its pinnacle at the Allianz Arena, home of Bayern Munich. Snare a ticket and watch one of the continent’s top teams in action. Other lively options include Hamburg, Bayer Leverkusen, Hertha Berlin, Schalke 04 and Werder Bremen.  Nuremberg: visit the Chritkindlesmarkt  The run-up to Christmas sees the towns and cities of the nation come alive with traditional street markets, and nowhere more so than in Nuremberg. Toys, gingerbread and handmade presents are among the countless festive items on sale at the famous Christkindlesmarkt, while warming Glühwein (mulled wine) forms an integral part of the experience.  Southern Germany: cycle the Romantic Road  Germany has more than 200 long-distance cycle paths that spin from riverside routes and chocolate box villages to major cities and mountain-bike trails. Arguably the most picturesque of the lot is the 350km-long (220-mile) Romantic Road that stretches from Wurzburg (near Frankfurt) to Füssen in southern Germany, linking a number of charming towns and fairy-tale castles. And yes, tandem bikes are available to hire. The Romantic Road is marked along the way with brown signs.  Southern Germany: explore Neuschwanstein Castle  The archetypal fairytale palace, world-famous Neuschwanstein stands among Alpine foothills in Bavaria. It's the most elaborate of King Ludwig II's castles, with much of its design inspired by Wagnerian operas. And if you think the outside looks dramatic, wait until you see the gilded decor and furnishings that the interior serves up. Avoid a visit to Neuschwanstein during the summer months if you don't want to get stuck in the crowd of the castle's 6000 daily visitors.  The Rhine: take a cruise  The Rhine (spelt Rhein in German) is one of the longest rivers in Europe, and one of its most impressive to boot. Take a cruise from Koblenz past fairytale castles, pretty villages and the imposing Lorelei Rock, legendary home of a siren said to have lured boatmen to their demise.

sierra leone,"Like one of its rough diamonds, Sierra Leone is a destination of exquisite natural beauty. But despite its lush rainforests, palm-fringed beaches, fascinating history and vibrant culture, the country remains largely unexplored and undiscovered.      It’s hard to believe now, but Sierra Leone once attracted some 100,000 tourists a year. They were drawn to the country’s white sandy beaches, azure waters and swaying palms, until the horrors of civil war ravaged the country and knocked it off the tourism map.      Suffice to say Sierra Leone remains somewhat overshadowed by this bitter and bloody conflict, which raged between 1991 and 2002. Dramatised in the 2006 film Blood Diamond starring Leonardo DiCaprio, the war is still one of the first things most people think about when Sierra Leone is mentioned.      Happily, this negative reputation is gradually receding, and a new picture is emerging. Pioneering travellers are also trickling back to this corner of West Africa to rediscover the country’s many charms.      In some ways, nothing has changed. Known locally as ‘Sweet Salone’, Sierra Leone remains one of the friendliest countries on the continent. The smiling people and relaxed vibe are characteristic of this small nation. Wherever you go, and whomever you meet, you’ll be greeted as though you are part of the family.      Another thing you will notice in Sierra Leone is the abundance of wildlife. From hippos, forest elephants and chimpanzees, to bountiful birds and exotic insects, Salone is a dream ticket for nature enthusiasts. Pack your binoculars.      It’s also a paradise for sun-seekers. In fact, Sierra Leone’s gorgeous sandy beaches are considered by many to be the best in West Africa. Combine this with the country’s off-the-beaten-track feel, welcoming people, and awe-inspiring scenery, and it’s easy to see why ‘Sweet Salone’ is being vaunted as an up-and-coming destination for adventurous travellers.","Sierra Leone  Attractions in Sierra Leone  Bo Town  Head to Bo’s ‘Big Market’ to bargain for West African fabrics, rub shoulders with traditional herbal remedy hawkers and walk amongst the dried fish stands, taking in the atmosphere and interacting with the traders. In nearby villages, you can sample poyo (palm wine), or taste local delicacies such as coconut cake, plantain chips and groundnut shortbread.  Bonthe Island  Despite being still relatively difficult to access via road, Bonthe Island is a must for those interested in history, culture or big game fishing. Surrounded by mangrove swamps, with fish-rich waters and long untouched beaches, the island has long been a tourist drawer, especially with sport fishing enthusiasts since one of the biggest tarpon ever recorded was caught here.  Bunce Island  Take a boat trip up the Sierra Leone River to Bunce Island, one of the major slave trading stations in West Africa. Between 1670 and 1808 tens of thousands of slaves left Bunce Island for the West Indies and North America, and you can learn about the history of the slave trade, as well as its social, political and economic impact both sides of the Atlantic on the island.  Freetown Peninsula  From atop Leicester Peak, which nestles between the Atlantic Ocean and surrounding mountains, superb views of the capital unfold. A narrow, steep road through the hills leads to the old Creole villages (dating from 1800) of Leicester, Gloucester and Regent.  Freetown, Old Fourah Bay College  Listed in 2007 by the World Monuments Fund as one of the world's 100 most endangered historic sites, Old Fourah Bay College earned Sierra Leone the nickname the ‘Athens of West Africa’. The original building, dating back to 1848, is still visible even after suffering significant fire damage.  Freetown, sightseeing   Freetown, surrounded by verdant hills, is both a colourful and historic port town. Attractions include a 500-year-old cotton tree, the De Ruyter Stone, Government Wharf and King's Yard, where freed slaves waited to be given land. Also, worth a visit are Marcon's Church and King Jimmy’s Market close to Freetown harbour.  Mount Bintumani  If you’re looking for ‘off-the-beaten’ track experiences, Mount Bintumani, Sierra Leone’s highest peak at 1,945m (6,381ft) is the destination for you. Part of the Loma Mountains, to reach the summit you will need to hike across high grass plains, cross rickety rope bridges straddling steep gorges, and scramble over vertiginous cliffs. It’s all part of the experience, though.  Outamba-Kilimi National Park  Originally protected because of its high density of chimpanzees, Outamba-Kilimi National Park offers varied and spectacular scenery with a mixture of jungle and savannah grasslands. Elephant, rare pygmy hippos and even rarer bongo antelope are all in residence, along with more than 100 different species of bird and the ancestral graves of the Susu tribe.  Rogbonko Village Retreat  Immerse yourself in local culture with a visit to one of the numerous villages dotted around the country. Rogbonko Village Retreat, for instance, is a community-based cultural exchange project where it is possible to learn about Temne tribal culture, experience everyday life and relax in the quiet settings of a traditional village.  Sulima  Located on the Moa River estuary, amongst the freshwater oyster-dotted mangroves, Sulima is a relaxing and friendly beach town where you can sunbathe, surf or uncover old tombs from the 19th century, which belonged to British traders. These imperialist merchants used to ply their trade, sometimes in slaves, along the West African coast.  Tacugama Chimpanzee Sanctuary  Tacugama Chimpanzee Sanctuary, just 30 minutes from Freetown, is home to more than 40 orphaned or illegally-captured chimpanzees, which now live in a luscious forest surrounding the capital. Staff run guided tours twice a day, while the sanctuary also offers overnight accommodation to enable even more time with our closest living relatives.  Tiwai Island Wildlife Sanctuary  An island on the Moa River, Tiwai is home to 11 primate species, more than 700 species of plant, and a large variety of insects and butterflies. Its star is perhaps the elusive pygmy hippo. The island is also an entry point to Gola Forest National Park, reached by hiking through one of the protected natural corridors.",africa,,
alderney,"Renowned for its wildflowers and quaint town of St. Anne, Alderney draws in city folk from France and England who are in search of some peace and quiet. Alderney's true appeal, however, extends beyond the picturesque flora and fauna. The island proudly has more than 30 social, sporting and cultural events a year and is a favoured destination for food lovers.  Visitors will enjoy the best of both town life and the countryside. Walking routes cover rugged cliffs, while there are also sandy beaches and serene terrain. Wild flowers are a highlight for nature lovers, as are the sweeping green countryside and plentiful bird species. Meanwhile, St Anne's central church and picturesque streets offer a chance to see a storybook town in real life.  Golfing and fishing are popular activities with visitors, as is cycling, hiking and sailing. But if you're in the mood to take it easy, Alderney is a lovely spot to simply lap up the fresh air and stunning views.  Then there's the history. Alderney has some 5,000 years of it, seen in the dolmens and megaliths that still remain, as well as constructions dating back to the island's Norman takeover, which predated the Norman Conquest of Britain by more than a century.  Accommodation ranges from converted stately homes, quaint guesthouses, or one of two stunning battlements, Fort Corblets and Fort Clonque. Camping is also popular, especially at the campsite on Saye Beach near windswept sand dunes.  The third largest of the Channel Islands, Alderney is less than 6km long (3.5 miles), meaning you can get to grips with most of the island in a couple of days. Compared to the British mainland, the weather is generally pleasant, so you can spend the rest of your visit taking it easy, while trying the exceptional seafood in many traditional pubs and restaurants.","Alderney  Attractions in Alderney  Alderney lighthouse  Alderney's historic lighthouse at the eastern end of the island near Quesnard Point has served as a watchful eye since its construction in 1912. 32m (96ft) in height, it is well worth climbing its stairs for the view.  Bird watching  Bird watching tops most people's lists for things to do in Alderney. Longis Bay, next to Longis Common is a birder's favourite.  Boat tour  The Alderney Wildlife Trust (www.alderneywildlife.org) organises round-island boat tours. For seabird spotting, especially for puffins and gannets, by boat is the way to go.  Cinema  The Alderney Cinema is in an old 19th century cinema which until recently still broke for half-time while the projectionist changed the film reel. Three to four current releases are shown each month, and screenings are organised and managed by volunteers from the Alderney Cinema Club.  Fishing  There is no permission needed to fish anywhere from the coastline or the harbour, so find some tack and drop in a line. Local shops are well-stocked with equipment and advice. The Angling Festival (www.alderneyangling.com) is held annually in October.  Golf  The golfing on Alderney is good with a nine-hole course overlooking the water. For information, contact the Alderney Golf Club (www.alderney.org/golf).  Ride the rails  Take a ride in a reclaimed London Underground carriage with the Alderney Railway (www.alderneyrailway.com). It's the only railway on the Channel Islands.  Sail  From Alderney you can sail to the other Channel Islands and France. Sailing is a favorite sport here and the Alderney Sailing Club (www.alderneysailingclub.com/) organises several annual events and races, including the Alderney International Sailing Regatta (usually held in July).  St Anne  Explore the island's main town of St Anne, which dates back to the 15th century and has numerous shops and inns lining its cobbled streets.  St Anne's Church  St Anne's focal point is the town church, often referred to as the 'Cathedral of the Channel Islands' as it is one of the largest in the Channel Islands. It is also the home of the Alderney Society Museum, which documents the island's history from Neolithic times.  Swimming  Alderney is blessed with numerous sandy beaches which are perfect for soaking up the sun or splashing about in the surf. Recommended for windsurfing and waterskiing are Arch Bay, Braye Bay, Clonque and Say. Board surfers should head to Corblets.  Walking  The Alderney Wildlife Trust (www.alderneywildlife.org) has published a series of recommended walks and also offers guided tours throughout the main season. The entire island can be traversed, with every side offering scenic views.",europe,channel islands,
burkina faso,"On the face of it you can see why Burkina Faso lacks mainstream appeal: a landlocked West African nation with rowdy neighbours, this country has a harsh climate, unforgiving geography and an infrastructure few would want to be at the mercy of. Set piece attractions are also lacking.      Yet Burkina Faso remains an enthralling destination for intrepid travellers, thanks to its wonderful inhabitants and dramatic landscapes. As such, the country, though not frequently visited, is a fine place in which to immerse yourself in West African culture.      Meaning “land of the honest people,” Burkina Faso proudly proclaims to be one of the friendliest countries in Africa – and visitors are sure of a warm welcome. Burkinabé, as the people of Burkina Faso are known, are the exact opposite of the harsh land that they inhabit – and it is these cordial and courteous people who make coming here such a joy.      Burkina Faso’s traditional cultures are best sampled in its two largest cities: the fabulously named capital, Ouagadougou (also known as “Ouaga”) and the second city of Bobo-Dioolasso (simply referred to as “Bobo”).      Both have large communities of artists, particularly Ouagadougou, which is famed for its music scene. The art and architecture of the capital are also worthy of attention, with several largescale sculptures enlivening the streets.      Away from the cities, Burkina Faso’s four national parks harbour a surprising diversity of wildlife. If you can’t explore them all, then do make a beeline for Arli, which is home a wide range of ecosystems and is an important habitat for West Africa’s last big cats and elephants. Hippos, monkeys and various exotic bird species also call this national park home.      Burkina Faso might not suit first time travellers, but for hardy adventurers this is a destination in which to veer off the tourist trail and discover the hidden gems of West Africa.","Burkina Faso  Attractions in Burkina Faso  Cool down at Karfiguéla Falls  A series of waterfalls and swimming pools along the Komoé River, Karfiguéla Falls are a great place to both cool down and enjoy the natural beauty of the area. Though permanently flowing, the falls are at their best in or just after the rainy season, which can make reaching them by road an experience in itself.  Explore the bustling streets of Bobo Dioulasso  The lifeblood of Bobo Dioulasso, the largest town inhabited by the Bobo people, are the attractive streets around its bustling market, the Grand Marché. Other city attractions are the Musée Provincial du Houët with regional relics, arts and crafts, and the spectacular mud-brick Grande Mosquée in the Kibidwé district.  Go hiking in the southwest  The best areas for hiking are in the southwest of the country, around the Banfora escarpment, which offers excellent views of the whole region. The Sénoufo region, west of Banfora, is also very pleasant, as is the Lobi region around Gaoua, southeast of Bobo Dioulasso. Mountain bike trips can also be arranged in these areas for those seeking adrenaline.  Marvel at Sindou’s rock formations  The seemingly endless geological landscape of fracturing peaks around Sindou provides a spectacular, and peaceful, contrast to Burkina Faso's rapidly growing cities. Eroded into their current shapes by water over millennia, and heavily wrapped in local folklore, the peaks are one of the country's finest natural wonders.  Mingle with royalty in Tiébélé  Tiébélé's royal court is a large traditional Sahelian compound of vibrantly painted and windowless mud huts that are home to some 450 people. With low doorways and dark interiors these structures are traditionally built in a figure of 8. Black, brown, and white symbolic geometric designs adorn the outer walls, and are refreshed annually in February or March.  Peruse the wares at the International Arts and Crafts Fair  Held every two years in the capital, Ouagadougou, the International Arts and Crafts Fair is one of Africa's most important trade shows and has been popular with bargain hunters since its inception in the early 1980s. Visitors can buy anything from jewellery and textiles to carvings and intricate metal work.  Uncover the Mossi Empire in Ouagadougou  An important centre of the Mossi Empire since the 15th century, Ouagadougou's Ethnography Museum contains a substantial collection of Mossi artefacts. It became the permanent residence of the Moro-Naba emperor in 1681. The Bangr-Weoogo urban park, once the tribe's sacred forest, provides the city with some much needed green space. Pabre, an ancient Mossi village, is a short distance away.  View Burkina’s varied game  Given Burkina Faso's dry climate its four national parks – Kaboré Tambi, Deux Balés, Arli and W – are perhaps surprisingly well-stocked, home as they are to some of Africa's most renowned wildlife including elephant and big cats. South of Ouagadougou, near Pô, the Reserve de Nazinga has a large population of elephants, antelopes, monkeys, baboons and warthogs, so don't forget your binoculars.  Visit Hippo Lake  The Mare aux Hippopotames (or Hippo Lake) was created in 1937 around a fresh water lake, marshes and forests flooded by the Black Volta River. Home to around 100 hippos, it is also an important site for wetland birds. Visitors may be taken out in a pirogue to view the hippos for a small fee.  Wake early for the Moro-Naba ceremony  At around 0600 every Friday, the Nabayius Gou ('the Emperor goes to war') ceremony is performed at the Moro-Naba Palace in Ouagadougou. It depicts the magnificently bedecked emperor being restrained by his wife and subjects as he sets off to make war with his brother.",africa,,
florida,"Sizzling beaches or a theme park bonanza might tempt you to Florida, but there’s more to the Sunshine State than golden sands and Disney shows.

It is a good opportunity to see the ethnic diversity of the country displayed through different groups of costumed dancers and musicians. The locals certainly know how to throw a party.  Enjoy a beautiful beach  Feeling adventurous and yearning for sandy shores? Then make tracks for the town of Varela, on the border with Senegal.

On one level, this is restrictive; footloose, freewheeling, make-it-up-as-you-go trips are not an option here. The trade-off, however, is that these restrictions have preserved one of the most fascinating cultures on earth, in a pristine mountain environment that has changed little over the centuries. To visit Bhutan every visitor, whether alone or in a group, must make all their travel arrangements through a Bhutanese tour operator, or associated organisation, and pay a fixed daily fee of US$200-250. However, before you baulk, this fee includes all meals, accommodation, transport and guides. Having made this investment, travellers are then free to explore this mesmerising mountain kingdom, known to its people as Druk Yul, or ""Land of the Thunder Dragon."" Some tour the ancient dzongs (fortress monasteries) in the valleys surrounding the capital, Thimphu. Others seek out snow leopards and yetis – known here as migyur – in remote national parks. Those with the stamina and budget take on the legendary Snowman Trek, a 24-day odyssey over high Himalayan passes.Wherever they go, visitors will encounter exquisite scenery and the famously friendly Bhutanese people, who, though fascinated by foreigners, remain in touch with the value, and values, of their traditional way of life. By subscribing to a ""high value, low impact"" brand of tourism, Bhutan has made concessions to the modern world, but on its own terms. And that seems to be working for this magical kingdom, which regularly polls as the happiest place in Asia.","Bhutan  Attractions in Bhutan  Attend an archery competition  Archery is a national obsession in Bhutan, and archery competitions are held across the country, with huge crowds admiring, and betting on, the skill of local archers. Traditionally, the Bhutanese used handmade bamboo bows, but these days, high-tech carbon fibre bows are all the rage. Archery competitions are major social events in Bhutan, alcohol flowing freely.  Be beguiled by Bumthang  Trongsa is the gateway to beautiful Bumthang, where four sacred valleys hide a string of ancient monasteries and captivating country towns. Most visitors head for Jakar, the most substantial settlement, and then roam along the scenic Chokhor Valley, visiting ancient chapels and chortens set amidst sublime mountain scenery.  Be captivated by the colours of Punakha  Straddling the confluence of the Mo and Pho Rivers, Punakha Dzong was the second Buddhist monastery to be built in Bhutan, founded by the father of the nation, Ngawang Namgyal. Set against a backdrop of trickling water, the fortress is particularly atmospheric in spring, when jacaranda trees burst into pale purple flowers along the riverbanks.  Climb a pass for epic Himalayan views  Travelling from one valley to the next in Bhutan involves climbing over breathless mountain passes, and all offer spectacular views. Crowned by 108 memorial chortens, the 3,100m (10,171ft) Dochu La, between Thimphu and Punakha, offers a breath-taking vista of the eastern Himalaya, while the 3,810m (12,500ft) Cheli La near Paro, is the highest motorable pass in the country.  Explore historic Thimphu  Set in a broad valley in the west of the country, Thimphu is Bhutan's only proper city, but the modern and medieval world come together with surprising harmony.  The Bhutanese capital is awash with historic sights: essential stops include the mighty dzong (fortress monastery) of Tashi Chho, Thimphu's bustling weekend market and the towering statue of Buddha that rises above the city.  Heed the calming call of Tashi Yangtse  Travellers who roam to the remote valleys of Trashi Yangtse leave the crowds far behind. In this serene part of the world, women spin on the doorsteps and mountain streams burble beside rice fields and ancient chortens. The gateway to this tranquil Shangri La is Tashi Yangtse, the leaping off point for hikes to nature reserves, mountain monasteries and paper workshops.  Scramble up to Drametse Goemba  The views are spectacular as you drive up a rough, vertiginous dirt track to Drametse Goemba. This is the most important monastery in the east of the country, and its chapels are full of memorial chortens, gold Buddha images and curiosities gathered by the monks over the centuries. A massive thondrol (giant thangka painting) is unfurled here every November.  See rare birds in pristine forests  The mountain valleys and jungle-cloaked hills of Bhutan are home to more than 600 species of birds, including rare black-necked cranes, which winter in the Phobjikha and Bumdeling valleys. Specialist tour operators offer birding tours to sanctuaries across the country, particularly during the crane season from October to February.  See the institutions that drive the world’s happiest state  Thimphu is the administrative and religious capital of Bhutan, and the focal point of both enterprises is Tashi Chho Dzong, home to the government ministries, the king's throne room and the largest monastery in the country. The monumental monastery is presided over by the Je Khenpo, the chief abbot of Bhutan, and home to over 1,600 monks.  Take in a tsechu  Bhutan's Buddhist festivals are some of the most colourful celebrations on Earth. All of the nation's dzongs and goembas (monasteries) host tsechus – animated dance festivals, where monks don rainbow-coloured costumes and fearsome monster masks and dance to the tune of horns, drums and gongs. It's a vital, invigorating introduction to the customs and legends of Bhutanese Buddhism.  Trace royal history at Tongsa Dzong  Many visitors stay close to Paro and Thimphu, but it's worth roaming further afield to Trongsa in central Bhutan, where the nation's largest monastery creates an impressive profile against the surrounding hills. This is the ancestral home of the Royal Family, with nearly two dozen separate chapels and a fascinating museum housed in the watchtower on the hillside above.  Trek into the Bhutanese Himalaya  There's no better way to experience Bhutan's stunning mountain scenery than to see it as the locals do, on foot, on the walking trails that criss-cross the hills and peaks. The high altitude Snowman Trek (25 days) is the most famous route, but most people opt for shorter, less costly walks, that still offer captivating cultural interactions and magnificent mountain views.  Trek to Taktsang (Tiger's Nest) Goemba  The trek to Taktsang (Tiger's Nest) Goemba tops the list of things to do in Bhutan. This revered monastery clings dizzily to the face of a 900m (2,952ft) precipice in the Paro Valley. According to legend, Guru Rinpoche flew to this site on a magical tiger and meditated in a cave before continuing his journey to spread Buddhism across the Himalaya.  Wander Paro’s monasteries and museums  Paro is the main port of arrival for most visitors, and a typical bustling Bhutanese country town. Paro Dzong is one of the nation's finest monuments, and the National Museum provides a handy introduction to the culture and history of Bhutan, before you head into the hills to explore more monasteries, ruins and ancient temples.  Wangdue Phodrang  Right in the centre of Bhutan, Wangdue Phodrang is famous for its castle-like dzong, built in the 17th century atop a curving ridge at the confluence of two rivers. The district is known for its slate carving and bamboo weaving, and for many centuries, this was the seat of one of Bhutan's most powerful dzongpens (regional governors).  Watch ancient arts come to life in Thimphu  The weekend market in Thimphu is crammed with vendors selling Bhutanese handicrafts – delicately embroidered shawls, thangka paintings, fearsome Buddhist masks, rolls of prayer flags – and you can see the artisans at work in the National Institute of Zorig Chusum campuses in Thimphu or Trashi Yangtse. This government enterprise was founded to preserve ancient arts such as embroidery and thangka painting.",asia,,
washington state,"Nature went into overdrive when it worked its magic in Washington. Wild beaches, verdant rainforests, snow-sprinkled volcanoes, bijous island retreats and the continent’s deepest river gorge all collide in the ‘Evergreen State’. Sure, it rains a lot, but whoever let a bit of precipitation get in the way of adventure?      And there’s plenty of adventure to be found. Hike in Alpine meadows, trek through moss-covered forests and skip over driftwood on the Olympic Peninsula’s storm-pounded beaches. Climb a volcano at Mt Rainier or ski down one at Mt Baker. Kayak with orcas in the San Juan Islands, set sail at sunset in Puget Sound, go windsurfing on the Columbia River or hold onto your hat jetboating into Hells Canyon.      For all its epic scenery though, the state’s star attraction is Seattle. The birthplace of grunge, the city is a laidback hub of creativity that entices travellers with its legendary live music scene, hip neighbourhoods and eclectic attractions. Learn guitar in a Frank Gehry-designed museum, shop for Scandi chic in historic Ballard, or figure out the password to drink cocktails in a speakeasy.      South of Seattle, cross the fabulous Chihuly Bridge of Glass, a kaleidoscopic pedestrian overpass connecting the Museum of Glass to downtown Tacoma.      If big-city thrills don’t do it for you, how about a Bavarian hamlet? Tucked into the Cascade Mountains, little Leavenworth risked losing everything when the local sawmill closed and the railroad was rerouted. So the good townsfolk decided to rebrand their village, and the result is a strangely compelling blend of Bavarian architecture, lederhosen-clad residents and Wienerschnitzel.

bonaire,"Bonaire is the second-largest island in the former Dutch Antilles, and has desert-like terrain offset by inviting turquoise waters. Beneath the water's surface, rainbow-hued fish drift in between coral, and many believe argue that the diving and snorkelling here is the best in the Caribbean; Bonaire's relative lack of tourism means much of its coral has gone undisturbed. For those seeking sailing or windsurfing, the characteristic windswept postures of the divi divi trees show that Bonaire's warm, dry and breezy climate is ideal for these sorts of activities.       Bonaire is highly eco-friendly and keen not to impair the fragile infrastructure of the coral, nor unsettle the island's serenity with heavy development and glitzy nightlife. Consequently, Bonaire's beautiful beaches and safe waters have remained intact. Flamingos wander the landscape of multi-hued salt plains, and multitudes of birds enjoy this paradisiacal sanctuary. Bonaire was part of the Netherland Antilles until its dissolution in 2010. It is now a special municipality of The Netherlands.","Bonaire  Attractions in Bonaire  Befriend a retired donkey  The arrival of new agricultural technology made many of Bonaire's donkeys redundant. Cue the Bonaire Donkey Sanctuary, a not-for-profit organisation set up to take care of mules that have long since retired from working on the salt pans. Visitors are encouraged to feed and help care for the ageing animals.  Discover Bonaire National Marine Park  Bonaire's beautiful National Marine Park is centred on a spectacular coral reef, which has helped the island establish itself as a world-class diving destination. This unspoiled area is maintained and monitored throughout the year by marine biologists, who are blazing a trail for others to follow in the world of coral reef conservation.  Embrace the festival spirit  Bonaire has many festivals to choose from and tourists are always encouraged to join in the celebrations. The most popular jamboree is the colourful Carnival, which comes to a dramatic finale with a firework display and the ceremonial burning of King Momo (an effigy, not a real king). Other festivals to look out for include:  the Simadan (Harvest) Festival in Rincón, with its songs and dances, and Rincón Day, which celebrates the traditions and culture of Bonaire in the island's oldest village.  Explore Bonaire’s darker past  The bright, white huts on Witte Pan were inhabited by subjugated salt workers until the abolition of slavery in 1863. The eerily small holes on their frontage served as doors, which the slaves would crawl through at night after a gruelling shift. The slave huts serve as a sober reminder of Bonaire's repressive history.  Flock to see the flamingos  Bonaire is renowned for its flamboyant flamingo population, most of which inhabit the protected southern areas of the island. Arguably one of the easiest places to spot these ostentatious birds is the beautiful lagoon of Gotomeer, where they gather to feed on brine shrimp. Just be sure not to forget to bring the telephoto lens.  Learn to dive  The waters around Bonaire are clear, safe and teeming with fish of every size and hue. In short, the island is a diver's paradise and you'd be a fool to forgo the superb scuba diving and snorkelling on offer here. With idyllic learning conditions and some of the best dive instructors in the Caribbean, it's a great place to learn the ways of the underwater world.  Pamper to pleasure on Pink Beach  Beautiful beaches abound in Bonaire, but Pink Beach has to be one of the finest. Living up to its name, this sandy stretch gets its tinge, most obvious at sunset, from tiny bits of pink coral and crushed seashell. Refreshingly, the beach is not commercialised – there are no ice cream parlours or amusement arcades here – so make sure you take plenty of sun lotion, food and refreshments.  Relax in Rincón  Rincón, Bonaire's oldest village, boasts a sprinkling of bars serving chilled tipples beneath brightly coloured roofs. Rincón translates as the Spanish for 'nook' or 'corner' and is ensconced in the north of the island in an inland valley. One of only two towns on the island, Rincón also used to house slaves who worked on the salt flats.  Ride the wind and waves  Bonaire's climate is perfect for wind and kitesurfing, and attracts professionals from around world, who flock to its breezy shores to practice and compete. Calm, shallow waters and regular on-shore winds make it one of the best places in the world to hone your skills and don't take our word for it: Windsurf Magazine voted it best destination in the world to learn to windsurf.  Set sail for adventure  Half or full day cruises to Klein Bonaire, the island's tiny uninhabited sister isle, can be arranged for wannabe sailors. If you're lucky enough to have your own vessel, there are extensive moorings in Kralendjik harbour, Plaza Marina and Harbour Village Marina. And every second week of October there is a Sailing Regatta, during which there is a carnival atmosphere on the island.  Step back in time at Bonaire Museum  Located just outside Kralendijk, in a restored 1885 plantation mansion, Bonaire Museum displays artefacts depicting the history of the island: from the early days of the Caiquetio Indians and Spanish invaders to the Dutch colonialists and more modern times. It's also home to an impressive collection of seashells.  Take a hike up Mount Brandaris  Bonaire's loftiest point is Mount Brandaris (241m/784ft), which pokes out of the picturesque Washington-Slagbaai National Park in the island's interior. Intrepid explorers are also rewarded for reaching the summit with exceptional views and exotic flora, including the iconic Divi Divi trees, which grow sideways due to the powerful winds that buffet the island.  Trick your eyes at the salt flats  A trip to Bonaire's salt flats might not sound particularly interesting , but these are no ordinary salt flats: these salt flats change colour before your eyes – from breathtaking fuchsia to subtle pink –  according to fluctuations in the resident algae population. The view is astonishing and with a bit of imagination could even pass as a snow-filled winter scene.",caribbean,,
pacific islands of micronesia,"Micronesia comprises four archipelagos: the Federated States of Micronesia (Caroline Islands), the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands and the Republic of Palau.  The area has a turbulent history of foreign control and political change. Despite upheavals and foreign influences from Spanish, German, Japanese and US governments, many inhabitants have maintained their cultural heritage and traditions, while others have lifestyles inspired mainly by the teachings of 19th-century missionaries. Having come under UN Trusteeship, administered by the USA, at the end of World War II, all of the Pacific Micronesian states have now reached final political settlements.  Collectively, the islands are known for the dramatic tropical nature, pristine beaches and great diving opportunities. By contrast, the area has witnessed some of the darkest moments in recent history, with shipwrecks littering the sea beds, heavy nuclear weapons testing having been staged in the area, and the islet Tinian having the dubious privilege as being the launchpad from which the American B-29s set off for Japan to drop the Atom bomb. The inhabitants of the islands have nevertheless remained resilient in the face of history, and visitors can typically expect a warm welcome.

nepal,"Officially the highest country on Earth, lofty Nepal is commonly referred to as the “roof of the world.” That seems like a fitting moniker for this Himalayan nation, where soaring, snow-capped mountains disappear into the clouds like stairways to heaven.      Mount Everest is the star attraction. Tourists come in their droves to climb, hike and admire the world’s tallest peak, which flirts with the stratosphere at 8,848m (29,029ft). But this charming country is much more than just mountains.      The birthplace of Gautama Buddha, Nepal is an important pilgrimage site for millions of Buddhists, who come from far and wide to visit the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Lumbini, a temple complex where Buddha once lived.      Holy places abound in Nepal, but not just of the Buddhist variety; Hinduism has a strong foothold in the country and there are many Hindu temples scattered across the country (though some have been severely damaged by the 2015 earthquakes).      Also hit hard was the Nepali capital, Kathmandu, which is encircled by soaring mountain ranges. A beautiful, bustling city it stands at a cultural crossroads between India and China, whose influences can be seen in the architecture and tasted in the cuisine. Meanwhile, a Western vibe prevails in the lively Thamel district, which is lined with bars.      Kathmandu is a good starting point for travellers venturing into the jungle at Chitwan National Park, which is home to Bengali tigers, crocodiles and one-horned rhinos, plus myriad bird species. Phewa Lake is another draw for tourists, as are the hiking trails in the Himalayas.      Wherever you go though, wide smiles will be there to greet you; Nepalese people are amongst the friendliest in the world and it’s not uncommon to be invited into a stranger’s home for tea.      Sitting atop the world, Nepal is just one step away from heaven – and for those who have discovered the country’s many charms, it feels like it too.","Nepal  Attractions in Nepal  Float on Phewa Lake  After a trek up the Himalayas – or a night on the local beers – take a well-earned rest on the limpid waters of Phewa Tal in Pokhara. Whether you paddle yourself or hire someone to do it for you, make sure you visit Barahi Mandir, an island and temple in the middle of the lake.  Go on safari at Chitwan National Park  Nepal's oldest national park, Chitwan is home to endangered Bengal tigers, one-horned rhinos and mugger crocodiles, not to mention numerous bird species. Visitors can explore the park on elephants or in a safari vehicle. It's also possible to spend the night in watchtowers, listening to the roar of the jungle.  Go underground at Siddha Gufa  At 437m (1,434ft) deep, Siddha Gufa is the largest cave in Nepal and lays claims to some spectacular stalactites and stalagmites, not to mention a myriad of otherworldly rock formations. Located just outside the village of Bandipur, the cave can be accessed by bus from Pokhara.  Marvel at Mount Everest  The tallest mountain in the world, climbing Everest is the ultimate test of physical endurance. But if you can't make it to the summit, or even base camp, you can view this peak in all its glory from the window of a plane. Most domestic airlines offer scenic flights, which are available from Pokhara and other locations.  Paraglide over Pokhara  Pokhara has been touted as one of the best places in the world to go paragliding, thanks to its unique geothermal patterns and stunning landscapes. Several companies offer flight instruction, equipment rental and transport to and from the landing sites. Is there a better way to explore the world's highest country?  Party in Thamel  Once you've finished sightseeing in Kathmandu, have a well-earned beer in the lively Thamel district of the city. Packed with bars, clubs and restaurants, you won't struggle to find a glass of the local brew in these parts. As well as pints of Khukuri, you will also find local cuisine, fellow travellers and loud music.  Photograph Pokhara  Described as the ""jewel of Himalaya,"" Pokhara is a lakeside city of extraordinary beauty. Set to the backdrop of the snow-capped Annapurna mountain range, travellers fall for the city's many charms while visiting temples, shopping in traditional bazaars and boating on Phewa Lake.  Pilgrimage to Buddha’s birthplace  The birthplace of Gautama Buddha, Lumbini is arguably the most important pilgrimage site in the world for practicing Buddhists. This spiritual site is not just a draw for religious devotees, though: the shimmering, golden temples and pristine grounds attract many tourists too.  Raft the Marsyangdi River  Crashing through mountains are a series of rivers, which offer perfect conditions for white water rafting. From the swirling challenges of the Marsyangdi River, to the scenic Trisuli River, thrash it out on the country's exhilarating waterways, which are certain to get your heart racing and adrenaline pumping.  Relax in Namche Bazaar  Clinging to the side of the Himalayas, the hillside town of Namche Bazaar is a hub for those exploring the Everest region. Bakeries and pool houses treat those who have walked from Lukla, and Wi-Fi accessible spots can comfort those missing home. Though badly shaken by the earthquakes, it’s open for business.  Scout for souvenirs  Peruse Tibetan handicrafts and artefacts at the hugely impressive Boudhanath stupa, a centre of Tibetan exile culture, just a short ride from central Kathmandu. Alternatively, visit the lively bazaar in the bucolic hill town of Gorkha – the ancestral home of the Shah Dynasty and residence of the original Gurkha soldiers.  Spot temples in Kathmandu  Many of Kathmandu's religious monuments were destroyed during the 2015 earthquakes, including the landmark temple of Kasthamandap in Durbar Square. It's not all bad news. Incredibly the UNESCO-listed Hindu temple of Pashupatinath escaped relatively unscathed, as did Swayambhunath Stupa (also known as Monkey Temple), which offers sweeping panoramas and playful primates.  Take part in a festival  Nepal's calendar is packed with all manner of festivals. Highlights include Holi, a spring festival where paint is thrown over all and sundry; Tibetan New Year; the light festival of Tihar; and Dashain, the longest and liveliest festival on the calendar. Check our calendar to see when exact dates fall.  Try traditional yoga  Feel the stresses and strains of daily life ebb away from you at one of the many yoga retreats in Nepal. Kathmandu, Lumbini and Pokhara are teeming with centres offering yoga, meditation and various other traditional treatments, which are revered in Nepal for their healing qualities.  Veer off the beaten path at Annapurna  The trail to Everest Base Camp is a well-trodden one, so if you don't want to jostle for space with fellow hikers try the Annapurna Circuit. It's slightly quieter and offers epic mountain vistas. While accessible without a guide, inexperienced hikers are advised to seek assistance locally.  Visit artsy Patan  The city of Patan has long-standing artistic traditions and is renowned for its beautifully crafted, artisanal goods. It is also a place of unremitting beauty where UNESCO listed landmarks meet opulent palaces and art galleries. Its most impressive landmarks include Patan Durbar Square, Krishna Mandir, the Royal Bath, Kumbheshwor Temple and the Golden Temple.",asia,,
israel,"Israel has always been an alluring destination. From biblical times to present day, this slice of holy land in the Middle East has long attracted visitors. It has also attracted turmoil, as Israel has always been a politically sensitive and controversial country. Nevertheless, its appeal for visitors is enormous and the day-to-day issues facing residents have little effect on those coming to appreciate its astounding historic relics, impressive religious sites and exquisite natural beauty.      Home to the Mount of Olives, the Sea of Galilee and the ancient port of Jaffa, it's hard to go anywhere in Israel without stumbling upon a place of religious significance. But nothing can compare to the holy city of Jerusalem. Sacred to Jews, Muslims and Christians alike, this ancient metropolis is claimed by both Israel and Palestine and its status remains one of the core issues of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.      Jerusalem's stunning skyline is a complete contrast to the touchy political landscape, with its beautiful bell towers, striking minarets and the golden dome of the Al-Aqsa Mosque. Split into Arabic, Jewish and Christian quarters, this cultural melting pot translates into a sumptuous culinary scene, as well as a feast for the eyes and experiences.      Visually, Tel Aviv seems a world away from Jerusalem. Israel's commercial and political heart is a city of glistening skyscrapers, thronging streets and sandy beaches; of contemporary art galleries, excellent restaurants and hedonistic inhabitants. Quite a contrast, then, to neighbouring Jaffa, a historic port city of sprawling markets, cobbled docks and crumbling city walls. This juxtaposition of old and new is typical in Israel, where ancient cities like Nazareth and Acre exist alongside modern metropolises such as Haifa (home to the Baha'i Gardens) and Eilat (a beach oasis unlike any other).      Israel's landscapes are equally diverse. Mountains, deserts and fertile valleys can all be found in this sliver of the Middle East, while the Dead Sea, Red Sea, Sea of Galilee and Mediterranean coastlines offer everything from unique geological spectacles to seaside holiday resorts.      If you can read beyond the headlines and see past the politics, you will find a beautiful and beguiling nation quite unlike anywhere else on Earth.","Israel  Attractions in Israel  Beaches  With four coasts to choose from, Israel has an impressive variety of beaches. Sandy beaches line the Mediterranean Coast, notably Tel Aviv and north of Netanya, while the Red Sea offers access to colourful coral reefs. The Sea of Galilee’s beaches are ideal for picnics and the Dead Sea offers a unique and restorative experience.  Coral reefs  The waters off Eilat are rich in coral and perfect for some underwater sightseeing. Scuba or snorkel on underwater trails, take a submarine tour, or just marvel at the scene through the windows of the Eilat's amazing Underwater Observatory.  Dead Sea  Lying 430m (1,412ft) below sea level and spanning the border between Israel and Jordan, the Dead Sea is a natural wonder. It contains more minerals and salt than any other stretch of water in the world, making it inhabitable for plants and marine life. The saltiness also makes it possible to float on top of the water. Its natural properties make it a prime centre for spa treatments and relaxation therapies offered by a number of resorts in the area. The Dead Sea has strong Biblical connections via the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls, the oldest known Biblical documents, and as the site where King Herod built his palace of Masada.  Dome of the Rock  The intricately beautiful Dome of the Rock stands high on Temple Mount (Har HaBayit in Hebrew, Haram esh-Sharif in Arabic) in Jerusalem and is spiritually significant for both Jews and Muslims.  Haifa: Baha’i Shrine and German Colony  Taking pride of place in the heart of Israel's third largest city are the Baha'i Shrine and German Colony. The golden-topped Baha'i Shrine of the Bab, founder of the Baha'i Faith, stands atop an iconic hill that overlooks Haifa and is adorned by the perfectly manicured accompanying Baha'i Gardens. At the foot of the hill, you’ll find the German Colony, the beautifully restored cultural centre of the city full of cafes, restaurants and boutiques.  Hezekiah's Tunnel  The spooky Hezekiah's Tunnel (www.cityofdavid.org), a 500m (1,649ft) underground passage, looks like the perfect set for an Indiana Jones film. The tunnel serves to bring spring water to the Pool of Siloam, mentioned in the Bible as the place where Jesus healed a blind man. You'll need shorts, sandals and a strong flashlight.  Jerusalem Archaeological Park  The newly reconstructed Hulda Steps, once the main entrance to the Temple, are in the Jerusalem Archaeological Park (www.archpark.org.il), a few paces from Western Wall Plaza. Its Davidson Center includes a virtual reconstruction of a visit to the Temple 2,000 years ago. Experience Christianity at its most profound, at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, traditionally believed to be the site of the Crucifixion. A complex of different shrines, it is the heart of the Christian Quarter.  Jerusalem: Israel Museum  The Israel Museum in Jerusalem (www.imj.org.il) houses the country's principal collection of impressive archaeological discoveries and ancient art. These include the Dead Sea Scrolls which are displayed in an urn-shaped grand wing known as the Shrine of the Book. A trip to the museum will open your eyes to Israel's long and complex history.  Jerusalem: Mount of Olives  Dominated by church spires and the white tombs of the Jewish cemetery is the Mount of Olives. Christianity, Judaism, and Islam meet once again where significant events of each religion's past played out. The Garden of Gethsemane, Dome of the Ascension, and Tomb of the Virgin Mary are top pilgrimage sites.  Jerusalem: Yad Vashem Holocaust Museum  The impressive and moving Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial Museum in Jerusalem was built in remembrance of the six million Jewish people who perished in the Holocaust. A visit to Yad Vashem (www.yadvashem.org) is crucial for understanding the history of the country. The museum is extensive and contains many displays and exhibits.  Jerusalem: the Old City  Jerusalem's Old City is a living museum of religious buildings and historical intrigue. Be sure to visit some of the world's most significant buildings including the Christian Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the Jewish Western Wall and the Islamic Dome of the Rock. Explore the bustling markets and narrow lanes of the four Old City Quarters.  Kibbutz  These intriguing collective settlements can be found all over Israel and many offer workshops and accommodation facilities for tourists. They give great insight into local kibbutz life which is unique to the country. Kibbutz Ketura in the Arava Valley had the first photovoltaic solar panel field in Israel and is also the site of date palm sprouted from a 2000-year-old seed found at the archaeological site of Masada.  Markets  Exploring the traditional markets is a definite highlight of a trip to Israel. Fling yourself into Tel Aviv's Carmel Market, brimming with spices and fresh produce; try the traditional dishes in the Mahane Yehuda food market in Jerusalem; or haggle for anything from souvenirs to jewellery along the narrow streets of Jerusalem's Old City.  Masada  The cliff-top palace of Masada was built by King Herod and offers breathtaking views of the Dead Sea and Negev Desert. It also holds an important place in the history books and hearts of Jews as the last remaining Jewish stronghold when the Romans controlled the land. If you're up for it, make the trek to the top for incomparable sunrise views.  Mea She'arim  Jerusalem's Mea She'arim district is home to Israel's largest community of strictly observant Orthodox Jews who keep all their East European dress and traditions alive. Go there for a stroll and it'll feel like you're in pre-war Europe.

National parks and reserves  Israel's historic treasures and breathtaking landscapes are protected in over 70 national parks and nature reserves (www.parks.org.il). Remains of once grand cities such as Bet She'an and Caesarea are true archaeological wonders, while the Ein Gedi and Yehudiya nature reserves offer natural beauty and opportunities for hiking.  Nazareth   Known as Jesus' childhood home and the scene of Mary's annunciation, Nazareth attracts scores of pilgrims from around the world. In this predominantly Arab Christian city, where tiny, cobbled lanes weave between churches, mosques and a busy souk, you'll find the grand Basilica of the Annunciation looming proud and Nazareth Village, an open-air living-museum showcasing what life would have been like in the time of Jesus.  Negev desert: Makhtesh Ramon  Makhtesh Ramon (Ramon Crater) is a unique geological phenomenon located in the heart of the barren Negev Desert. It was formed after an ancient sea that once covered this region retreated, leaving a massive elongated heart-shaped crater in its wake. Today it measures a vast 40km (25 miles) long, 10km (6 miles) wide, and 500m (1,640ft) deep and provides for some astounding views, a wealth of wildlife-spotting and hiking opportunities.  Old City of Acre  Acre's Old City is a jumble of buildings dotted by minarets and church spires, and encompassed by a great citadel and imposing walls. Crusaders, Ottomans, Napoleon, the British Mandate authorities and Jewish freedom fighters combine to form a colourful past, while today Acre is a lively city with a bustling market and quaint fishing port.  Orchestral shows  Go to a performance by the Israeli Philharmonic Orchestra, or the New Israel Opera, or one of several other great orchestras in Tel Aviv which draw audiences from all over the world.  Sea of Galilee   The Sea of Galilee is a large lake in Israel's beautiful Jezreel Valley that is as picturesque as it is historically important. The shores are dotted with churches commemorating Jesus' miracles and baptism, while Tiberias - one of Judaism's four holy cities - is a popular tourist destination for young Israelis.  Via Dolorosa  The Via Dolorosa in Jerusalem's Old City traces the traditional path Jesus walked from judgment to crucifixion. The nine 'stations' along the route lead to five more in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.  Western Wall Plaza  Encounter Jewish faith and resilience in the immense, animated Western Wall Plaza (www.thekotel.org), below Temple Mount. Go on a Western Wall tunnel tour, which takes you to portions of the wall now buried deep beneath the city.",middle east,,
yukon territory,"Gigantic swathes of wilderness, thrilling gold rush tales and fascinating First Nations heritage turn road trips through the Yukon Territory into epic adventures. Stretching from the British Columbia border all the way to the Arctic Ocean, the Yukon encompasses huge slabs of unspoilt mountainous landscapes freckled with frontier towns, aboriginal communities and a heck of a lot of wild animals.      Fill your RV with supplies, chuck in a couple of spare tyres and drive Canada’s only all-weather road, the Dempster Highway, from Dawson City north across the Arctic Circle to Inuvik, in the Northwest Territories. Or follow the Silver Trail from Whitehorse through moose habitat to the historic mining towns of Mayo and Keno.      Whichever route you pick, seeing more wildlife than humans is pretty much guaranteed. There are twice as many moose as there are people, and caribou, grizzlies and elk all make regular roadside appearances. As for the few who do live here, the Yukon First Nations have been here the longest, and you can learn about their roots at aboriginal cultural centres, art studios, or the Adäka Cultural Festival, a cracking summer celebration on Whitehorse’s waterfront.      When gold was discovered in the Klondike in 1896, fortune seekers couldn’t get here fast enough. Relive the gold rush days with gold-panning, gambling halls and can-can girls in Dawson City or catch a ride on the White Pass & Yukon Railway, an iconic route connecting the Yukon with the port of Skagway, Alaska. Climbing nearly 900m (3,000ft), the train travels past mountains, glaciers and enough waterfalls to wear your camera out.","Yukon Territory  Attractions in Yukon Territory  Backcountry adventures  The wild backcountry of the Yukon Territory is exhilarating, but you should venture into it only in the company of a licensed outfitter or guide.  Camping  Pitching a tent beneath the stars in pristine wilderness in Tombstone Territorial Park, with its spectacular mountain and lake views, is an unforgettable experience. As in all government-approved campgrounds in the Yukon, a permit is needed to camp and you can only camp in designated areas, but you'll still have your head in the clouds - both literally and figuratively.  Canoeing  Tributaries of the Yukon River (including the Teslin, the Big Salmon and the Pelly) offer fast-flowing, flat water. You can reach wild rivers such as the Bonnet Plume and the Firth by bush plane; others, like the Tatshenshini and the South Macmillan, are accessible by road.  Carcross  An hour's drive south of Whitehorse, between Nares and Bennett Lakes at the foot of Nares Mountain, Carcross is worth a visit; the Caribou, one of the Yukon's oldest hotels, can be found here. Carcross connects to Skagway in Alaska via the Klondike Highway.  Glowing skies  If you look up at the night sky, you may be fortunate enough to see the Northern Lights (Aurora Borealis) flashing against the darkness. The magical ambience of a Yukon winter with its crisp air is perfect for watching this dynamic display. The Northern Lights Space and Science Centre (www.northernlightscentre.ca) is at Watson Lake.  Hiking  You can retrace the footsteps of the gold rush stampeders along the famous 53km (33-mile) Chilkoot Trail. The starting point is Dyea, near Skagway (Alaska).  Historic Dawson City  Notable buildings in Dawson City include the Commissioner's Residence and the Palace Grand Theatre, which stages the 1898 vaudeville show, Gaslight Follies, each summer.  Kluane National Park  Established in 1972, Kluane National Park and Reserve has been the home of the Southern Tutchone First Nations people for thousands of years. The park is a vast expanse of mountains and ice and encompasses the Icefield Ranges; the highest mountain in this range, Mount Logan, rises to 5959 metres (19,545 ft) and is the highest peak in Canada. Other popular activities on offer in the park include cross country skiing, boating, fishing, snowmobiling, cycling, mountainbiking and horseriding. A rafting trip down the Alsek River allows visitors to view the wildlife (including grizzly bears, Dall sheep and golden eagles) and glaciers along the way; however, permits for rafting on this Canadian Heritage river are strictly limited to one departure per day and visitors are advised to arrange their trip well in advance.  Mountain biking  The territory is a mosaic of historical trails and stunning scenery, featuring arduous climbs and rapid descents. The annual Kluane/Chilkat International Bike Relay (www.kcibr.org) sees contenders cycling through a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  Mountaineering  Mount Logan, part of the St Elias Range in Kluane National Park (www.pc.gc.ca), is the second-highest peak in North America at 5,959m (19,550ft).  Other national parks  Ivvavik National Park has a non-glaciated landscape with abundant wildlife, significant archaeological sites and the Firth River. Established in 1995, Vuntut National Park currently has limited visitor facilities.  Panning for gold  At GuggieVille Campground or Claim 33 on Bonanza Creek near Dawson City, amateur prospectors can pan for gold at the site of the original claim that sparked off the 1898 Klondike Gold Rush.  Whitehorse  Yukon's capital lies on the Yukon River. You can tour a restored sternwheeler, the SS Klondike (now a national historic site), or cruise Miles Canyon aboard the MV Schwatka. In summer, take in one of the many noon-hour performances at LePage Park that are part of the Arts in the Park festival.",north america,canada,
massachusetts,"The Pilgrims knew they were onto a good thing when they arrived in Massachusetts, and today this northeastern gem is an irresistible blend of high-class culture, idyllic beaches and adventures galore.      You can explore the nation's early history, walk in the steps of the Pilgrims, tour battleships, catch the excitement of a Boston Red Sox baseball game or be awed by whales drifting along the coastline.      The gateway to New England, Massachusetts was the destination of the Mayflower in 1620 and site of the Boston Tea Party, which helped ignite the American Revolution in 1773. Boston’s Freedom Trail is a must-do, but Massachusetts is more than a history lesson.      From masterpieces at the Museum of Fine Arts to a world-renowned symphony orchestra, Boston’s cultural scene is world class. (It has a cheeky side too – you can eye up complete disasters at the Museum of Bad Art.) Across the river, Cambridge is brainiac central, where both Harvard and MIT show off their share of fascinating museums.

tenerife,"Tenerife is undergoing something of a metamorphosis. Long synonymous with crass commercialism, the island has been pursuing a more discerning clientele in a bid to confine its pies, fries, and beer image to the history books.      Offering a closer and cost-effective alternative to the Caribbean, its verdant peaks and sandy shores are indeed attracting more refined pilgrims; those who come in search of sun and solace, rather than cheap booze and casual sex.      The hotel scene is changing, too. Once dominated by pile-them-high-and-sell-them-cheap apartments, the island’s accommodation offering has been enhanced by luxury resorts, where guests can practice yoga on manicured beaches, tee-off overlooking the Atlantic or go horse riding in the surf.      In line with its image change, Tenerife's gastronomic scene is also experiencing a revolution. Promenades still tempt sunbathers with all day British breakfasts and cheap beer, but in hotel dining rooms and chic restaurants a culinary movement is gathering pace. The island's excellent wines are also finding a new faithful amongst the tippling cognoscenti of Europe.      Tenerife, the largest and most populous of the Canary Islands, was formed in the aftermath of a mighty volcanic eruption. Mount Teide is a reminder of its fiery past, looming large over the island.       A UNESCO World Heritage Site, Teide is the third largest volcano in the world and, while she sleeps a deep slumber, she remains active. During the winter her obsidian flanks turn white with snow and in spring her dark surface is streaked scarlet by the dazzling spikes of tajinaste plants.      Mother Nature's less explosive contributions include the mountain rainforests of Anaga; the sandy beaches of El Medano; and the vertiginous cliffs of Los Gigantes in the wild west.      Bathed in year-round sunshine and possessing an impressive diversity of landscapes and micro climates, visitors to Tenerife can go from snowboarding to surfing in the space of a few hours and still have time to sip fine wine over a scarlet sunset and stargaze in some of the world's clearest skies.","Tenerife  Attractions in Tenerife  Admire the architecture at La Laguna  The former capital and now a UNESCO World Heritage Site, La Laguna's layout was the blueprint for many Latin American cities, including Cuba. Its old quarter has fine architecture from the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries and its Cathedral has been refurbished. Excellent daily market on Plaza Cristo and some mighty fine eateries.  Bathe in rock pools at Garachico  Once Tenerife's wealthiest town, Garachico's fortunes were swept away by a volcanic eruption in 1706, which destroyed the harbour and buried many of its fine buildings. Today the town's rock pools, hewn from solidified lava, are popular with locals and visitors alike, and are a brilliant place to swim amongst the tropical fish.  Climb Mount Teide  Visitors can (very nearly) reach the summit of Spain's highest peak by cable car, which runs up the side of this vast volcano (get there early to avoid queues). Take the path west to Pico Viejo for satellite views over the old crater and to see La Gomera, El Hierro and La Palma shimmering on the horizon.  Cool off at Siam Park  Siam Park is one of Europe's biggest water parks. This Thai-inspired aquatic complex has some of the highest, fastest and longest water rides in the world including a wave machine that supplies surf-sized waves alongside a white sand beach. There's also the appropriately named Tower of Power, a vertical water slide that plunges 28m (92ft) into a pool below.  Explore Teide National Park  Teide National Park has a plethora of walking trails, the toughest and most rewarding being the hike up all 3,718m (12,198ft) of Mount Teide to watch the sunrise. A night in the Altavista mountain refuge avoids the need for bureaucratic permissions and presents the opportunity for stargazing.  Get lost in underground lava caves  Formed by lava flows from the nearby Pico Viejo volcano, Cueva del Viento is a 17km (10 mile) labyrinth of underground tunnels. Located at Icod de los Vinos, the subterranean network is home to fascinating lava formations and 48 species of troglobites including blind cockroaches. Daily tours are available and reservations essential.  Go whale watching  In the warm Atlantic water between Tenerife and La Gomera, pods of bottle-nosed dolphins and pilot whales gorge on a constant tide of unsuspecting fish making this one of the best places on the planet to see these cetaceans in their natural habitat. Boats go out three times daily from the harbour at Los Gigantes.  Hike the Masca Ravine  The village of Masca is perched on a rocky outcrop and flanked by towering massifs on the edge of the Teno Mountains. Inaccessible until the 1970s, Masca is the starting point for a challenging, three-hour trek down the Masca Ravine to the sea, where boats take weary hikers to Los Gigantes. Make sure you pick up tickets for the boat in the village before you set off.  Imbibe culture at Candelaria  Well off the tourist trail, charming Candelaria is the spiritual capital of Tenerife. Its landmark basilica is certainly worthy of a visit and is most notable for its murals and statue of Black Madonna. The Plaza de la Patrona is another must see, with its grand bronze statues that represent the nine kings that ruled Tenerife prior to Spanish conquest. Tapas bars and great bakeries add to the town's appeal.  Question the history books at Guimar  Guimar is home to Tenerife's most enigmatic and enduring mystery; ancient pyramids. Some theorists believe the Pyramids of Guimar are proof that the Egyptians could make long sea voyages and may have discovered America. Most historians dispute this theory. Whatever you believe, the pyramids make for a compelling day trip.  Ride the waves in El Medano  A magnet for surfers, windsurfers and kitesurfers, El Medano has the best natural beaches on the island, several of them favoured by naturists. The resort's laid back, bohemian culture and its great cafes make it an attractive alternative to the busier southwest coast resorts.  Saunter around Puerto de la Cruz  Tenerife's original resort, Puerto de la Cruz still retains its Canarian culture and roots. Photogenic plazas surrounded by bars and restaurants; a fishermen's quarter which has morphed into the town's restaurant district; and a pretty harbour hosting year-round cultural events make it worthy of a visit.  Scuba dive at Las Galletas  The warm, clear Atlantic waters off Las Galletas conceal a submerged wonderland of volcanic arches, tunnels and caves teeming with tropical marine life and offer some of the best diving in Europe. Other excellent dive locations include Los Gigantes and Puerto de la Cruz, where you can explore the wreck of a DC3 plane crash.  Step back in time in La Orotava  Tenerife's most aristocratic town, sited in the lush valley from which it takes its name, La Orotava has a picturesque old quarter where you can see some of the best examples of traditional balconied mansions. Pavement cafes, tapas bars, gardens and antique shops add to its colonial attractions.  Take a city break in Santa Cruz  Capital of the western Canary Islands, the city of Santa Cruz is a great city break destination. Impressive architecture, leafy plazas bustling with cafes, art galleries and museums are all in easy strolling distance. City highlights are Parque Garcia Sanabria, Museum of Man & Nature, Plaza España and TEA art gallery. Evening entertainment centres around the trendy bars and restaurants of the Noria District.  Trek through the Anaga Mountains  The ancient peaks of the Anaga Mountains are perfect for a spot of hill walking. Carved by plunging ravines, peppered with white-walled hamlets and coated in lichen-dripping laurisilva forests, life in the Anagas has changed little in centuries. Challenging and dramatic, the mountains test and reward hikers in equal measure.",europe,spain,canary islands
philippines,"The other Southeast Asia, the Philippines is where Asia and Europe collide, over a sprawl of sand-circled tropical islands. Here, Catholic traditions meld with animist rituals and Islamic customs, creating a surreal melting pot that is unlike anywhere else in Southeast Asia.      You can thank the Spanish for the European influence, tangible in everything from the names of towns and barrios (neighbourhoods) to restaurant menus, where roast pork and paella are as common as noodles and seafood. Later, the Americans imposed their own vision and values – you can thank the US for the fastfood chains, the love of pop music, and the rainbow-coloured jeepneys that serve as local buses, evolved from military jeeps left behind from WWII.      With 7,107 islands, it’s hardly surprising that many of the Philippines’ most stunning attractions can be found in or around the sea. Boracay and other islands are ringed by some of the world’s most immaculate beaches and the waters offshore are a diver’s paradise, with pristine reefs, astounding tropical fish, migrating whale sharks and wrecks from WWII.      There’s much more, though. Away from the beaches are jungles, mountains, volcanoes and hidden caverns ripe for exploration. The volcanic nature of the islands is highly obvious – natural hot springs bubble up across the Philippines and the pyramid peaks of live volcanoes such as Mount Mayon call out to trekkers who don’t mind living dangerously.      It can’t been denied that the Philippines has a seedy side – the sex industry grew up to service American GIs during the Vietnam War – but it’s easy to avoid this gloomy scene and find more wholesome nightlife, where live bands perform note-perfect covers of any song you could name and even the smallest, palm-thatched village has a karaoke bar.      This isn’t a country that stages dozens of phony cultural shows for tourists, and the islands’ vividly colourful festivals (of which there are many) are predominantly aimed at locals. So it’s down to individual visitors to strike up conversations and discover a country where East meets West and traditional culture meets the modern world in a crash of colour and confetti.","Philippines  Attractions in Philippines  Ascend to the summit of Mount Apo  Rising to 2,954m (9,700ft) in the centre of Mindanao, Mount Apo ('Grandfather') is the highest peak in the country and a popular destination for trekkers. The whole Apo mountain range has spectacular waterfalls, rapids, forests, springs and mountain lakes, plus one of the longest ziplines in Asia on the southern slope of Mount Apo.  Be amazed by the rice terraces of the Cordillera  Breathtaking in scale, the rice terraces of North Luzon were carved out around 2,000 years ago by mountain tribes using only the most basic tools. Still farmed today, the terraces are accessible from the peaceful town of Banaue, from where it's possible to hike to isolated villages such as Batad for tribal encounters.  Climb a volcano  The islands of the Philippines were thrown up by the Pacific Ring of Fire, and there are active volcanoes all across the archipelago, many accessible on jungle treks. Mount Mayon near Legazpi puts on impressive lava shows, while the cones around Los Banos on Luzon island produce naturally hot mineral springs. Then there's Mount Pinatubo, which blew its top with devastating results in 1991.  Discover old Manila  There's more to Manila than crowds and traffic jams. In the centre are the remains of Intramuros, the Spanish walled city, still bound by parts of the massive wall that once protected it. Highlights include the historic San Agustin and Quiapo churches, Casa Manila (a reconstruction of a wealthy family's home) and the ruins of Fort Santiago.  Dive the wrecks of Calamian Islands  Although there's plenty to explore above the surface, the Calamian archipelago north of Palawan is most famous for its amazing collection of shipwrecks, the remains of a Japanese flotilla sunk during WWII. The resort of Coron is the gateway to this diving mecca, with numerous scuba centres offering trips to the wrecks.  Enjoy the Philippines’ second city  In the middle of the Visayas, Cebu is the Philippines' second biggest city, and a much more relaxing place to arrive than manic Manila. The island is famous for its diving, festivals and guitars, which have been made here since Spanish times. The Sinulog Festival in January is one of the islands' most colourful fiestas.  Explore colonial heritage at Vigan  WWII saw the destruction of much of the Philippines' Spanish heritage, so the collection of Spanish-era merchants' homes in UNESCO-listed Vigan is a rare delight. Some have been turned into museums, while others function as heritage hotels. Horse-drawn carriages (calesas) take tourists around this approachable city.  Explore the Bacuit Archipelago  Floating off the coast of Palawan, this collection of tiny islands is picture postcard territory, with soaring karst cliffs, crystal-clear lagoons and white sand beaches. From the resort town of El Nido, you can roam to amazing dive sites, coral lagoons and deserted beaches by bangka (outrigger boat) with a freshly caught seafood barbecue for lunch.  Feel the party spirit at a Filipino fiesta  The festivals of the Philippines are riotous carnivals, with spectacular fiesta food and amazing costume parades that fill the streets with music. They’re nominally Christian, but hark back to ancient tribal celebrations. Sinulog in Cebu City, Ati-Atihan in Kalibo, and Dinagyang in Iliolo are the top events on the cultural calendar.  Kick back on Boracay Island  The picture of postcard perfection, sandy Boracay Island may have been heavily developed, but it's still a gorgeous strip of sun, sea and palms. Whether you spend your days lazing on the beach, sipping happy hour cocktails in beach bars, kite boarding in the bay or diving the reefs just offshore, it isn't hard to see the appeal.  Meet local tribes in scenic Sagada  The laidback mountain village of Sagada is the gateway to the Central Cordillera, whose mountains are dotted with tribal villages, limestone caverns, and surging waterfalls. As well as beautiful scenery, cheap lodges and excellent food, Sagada is renowned for its hanging coffins, a funeral rite that harks back to ancient animist traditions.  Meet the world's smallest monkey in Bohol  Bohol Island is famous for its natural wonders, from the famous Chocolate Hills – a range of strangely uniform limestone hills resembling oversized chocolate drops – to the miniature tarsier, one of the world's smallest primates. Elsewhere on this laidback island are gorgeous beaches, rocky islands and Spanish-ruins, including the Baclayon Church, built in 1595.  See another world beneath the waves  The Philippines is one of the world's top diving destinations, with everything from sunken islands to stunning wreck dives on WWII warships. The wrecks of Coron are probably the single most famous diving spot, but other great dives include thresher shark encounters on Malapascua Island, and the reefs at Tubbataha, Apo and Anilao.  See the pink sands of Santa Cruz  Off the coast of Zamboanga in Mindanao, Santa Cruz Island is famous for its sandy beach that turns pink when corals from the sea are washed ashore. It's a gorgeous spot even by the standards of the Philippines and a great place to swim, surf, windsurf, snorkel or dive.  Snorkel with whale sharks in Donsol  This quiet fishing village has been a magnet for tourists ever since whale sharks were 'discovered' off the coast, though local fishermen had known about them for centuries. Today, local boatmen run snorkelling tours that offer the chance to get up close and personal with these amazing gentle giants – the world's largest fish – which can grow to the size of a bus.  Surf in Siargao  Spectacular surfing is one of the best-kept secrets in the Philippines, and this tiny island off the north coast of Mindanao sees spectacular swells from August to November, when breaks like Cloud Nine offer spectacular tube rides. The island is dotted with laidback resorts that come to life during the annual surfing contest in September/October.  Uncover Spanish heritage in Carcar  Carcar town, two hours south of Cebu City, is home to some of the best-preserved Castillian houses, gardens and churches in the Philippines. The town is also known for its delicious lechon (roast pig) and chicharon (crispy pork rind), so make a day of it and visit the public market for a slap-up meal.  Wakeboard on Camarines Sur  The province of Camarines Sur is gaining increasing attention as a playground for watersports, largely thanks to the Camsur Watersports Complex near Pili. This is one of the world's top wakeboarding facilities, and nearby are stunning beaches, caves and waterfalls, with good diving and sport fishing offshore.",asia,,
eritrea,"Eritrea is a difficult country to define. Although in Africa, it doesn’t feel wholly African. While its broad shore faces the Middle East, it is not overtly Arabian. And though its capital evokes the spirit of Europe, it is far from European.      For such a small country, Eritrea offers an astonishing variety and it tends to attract a motley crew of visitors: from archaeologists to architects; scholars to scuba divers; historians to hikers; and cyclists to steam railway buffs.      While there are many reasons to come to Eritrea, there is one impression that endures when you leave: the remarkable kindliness of the Eritrean people. Making friends here is an unavoidable pleasure and one that touches the lives of so many visitors.      The country stretches along the Red Sea and is low-lying in the eastern coastal regions and western border with Sudan, with a precipitous mountainous interior rising to a majestic 2,500m (8200ft) above sea level.      Having been colonised in part by the Turks and Egyptians, Eritrea took on a European flavor with the arrival of the Italians in 1885 during their belated entry in the “scramble for Africa”. The legacies of successive foreign forces, combined with a rich mix of nine local ethnic groups have created a diverse cultural landscape that offers the best of African, Middle Eastern and European influences.      Eritrea also boasts an abundance of historical and natural attractions. The colonial and modernist architecture of its towns and cities is as stunning and startling as the wildlife that populates its mountainous escarpments, deserts and coastline.      Elephants, lions, baboons, gazelles, leopards, ostriches, turtles, dugongs and some of the continent’s rarest birds can all be found here. And with a coastline extending nearly 1,000km (621miles) along the Red Sea, Eritrea offers some of the best diving and snorkelling in the world, as well as the most secluded beaches.      Once you’ve experienced Eritrea’s many secrets – travelled across its mountains and deserts, swam off its coastline, and met its warm people – it will only be a matter of time until you return for more.","Eritrea  Attractions in Eritrea  Akordat  The Turkish and Egyptian colonial periods left numerous interesting buildings and sites in Akordat (Barka Province) including the tomb of Said Mustafa wad Hasan. Qohaito, Metera and Rora Habab are also important archaeological sites.  Asmara Walks  There are few cities so suited to the simple pleasure of walking and exploring as Asmara. The climate is perfect, the streets are clean, refreshment is widespread, crime is very rare, the architecture is stunning, the distances are manageable, the sights are varied, and the people are warm. Explore the city on foot and discover its many hidden treasures, from 1930s cinemas to futuristic petrol stations, and when you're tired there's always a café nearby in which to refuel with a wide selection of drinks and pastries.  Beaches  With nearly 1,000km (620 miles) of Red Sea coast, Eritrea boasts a stunning range of untouched beaches – from pristine white sands to black volcanic shorelines and from the deserted to the popular tourist beaches around Massawa.  Dankalia  Dankalia occupies a large portion of southern Eritrea and the lowlands of northeastern Ethiopia. The portion of Dankalia that lies within Eritrea comprises the narrow strip of land extending to the south and kissed by the sea for almost 500km (310 miles). Even the gentle breezes off this most majestic of Red Sea coasts barely stirs the thick soupy air, which boils up from the baked ground in unforgiving waves that burn the skin and choke the lungs. If the devil wanted to create hell on earth, the infernal wastes of Dankalia would be his choice, but for the most intrepid travellers this hostile landscape offers an unforgettable journey.  Decemhare  The town of Decemhare is a short drive south of Asmara. It was a favourite settlement of the Italians who originally intended it to be the transport hub of the entire Italian Empire in the Horn of Africa. It is worth stopping in Decemhare to have a look around, if only to see what remains of this once proud town.  Emberemi  Emberemi is famous for the mausoleums of Sheikh el Amin and Muhammad Ibn Ali. It is an important pilgrimage site.  Explore Asmara's Modernist architecture  Asmara was the centre of Italy's East African Empire. Following Italy's invasion of Ethiopia in 1935, Asmara became a boom town and transformed into one of the most modern cities in Africa. Today, it appears like a city lost in time and possessing the highest concentration and most complete collection of Modernist architecture in the world.  Filfil  To the northeast of Asmara lies the Semienawi Bahri, or 'Green Belt' region of Eritrea. The area is more commonly known as Filfil and contains the last remnants of Eritrea's once abundant tropical forest, home to an impressive array of birds and mammals. It is hard to imagine such dense forest exists in this region of Africa. The forest thrives on the vast, moist escarpment that links the highland plateau with the burning lowland plains.  Go cycling  Although cycling is one of the country's popular sports, it is unusual for bicycles to be rented out to tourists. However, each year Eritrea hosts one of the toughest races along the Asmara-Keren road. Regular meetings are organised by the Cycling Federation (tel: (1) 117 280).  Keren  Keren is the capital of the Anseba province and the third largest city in Eritrea after Asmara and Massawa. It is a relaxed pretty town, famed for its quiet pace of life, colourful markets and ethnic diversity. It forms the crossroads between several roads that branch out towards Nakfa, Agordat, and Asmara. The town rests in a bowl, the rim of which is formed by the formidable peaks of Lalemba, Ziban, Senkil, Felestaw, Itaber and Amba Mountains.  Massawa  Massawa was an ancient port and remains the largest natural deep-water port on the Red Sea. If Asmara is an Italianate city, Massawa is Turko-Egyptian style, reflecting the periods of Ottoman and Egyptian rule from the 16th century to the late 19th century. The beautiful but ramshackle old town was damaged during the 'Struggle' but its coral block buildings still retain some of the former grandeur that makes this antique port appear like a miniature version of Zanzibar's Stone Town.  Metera and Senafe  The site of Metara on the outskirts of Senafe covers about 10 hectares, and is known variously amongst locals as Balaw Calaw, King Kaleb's remains and the Gate of Axum. There are many ruins including the ancient obelisk dating to the 3rd century. The nearby town of Senafe is dominated by the huge rocks to the south. You can climb to the top of the largest of these and it is worth it for the views but you should ask someone to show you the easiest way, as it is not a simple climb.  Monastery of Debre Bizen  Journey the spectacular road from Asmara to Massawa, 105km (65 miles). It descends from 2,438m (8,000ft) to sea level, with hair-raising hairpin bends negotiating the escarpment, and magnificent views over the coastal desert strip. 20km outside Asmara, the road passes through the pretty town of Nefasit, behind which, perched on top of the mountain ridge, is the famous Monastery of Debre Bizen.  Qohaito  Eritrea is rich in archaeological sites, many of which have yet to be excavated.  The ruins of Qohaito, on the road south of Asmara towards Senafe, and Adulis, on the coast, are the most famous. The site contains the Safra's Dam and the ruins of the palace of King Saba from the Axumite and pre-Axumite period. The ancient port of Adulis is currently being excavated.  The Dahlak Archipelago  With around 350 islands off the Eritrean coast the Dahlak Archipelago is a national park that is the window on an unspoilt underwater world of flat reef gardens and an extraordinary variety of sea life. Travellers cannot go alone or without permission and should also be mindful of the extreme temperatures.  Tomb of Said Abu Bakr el Mirgani  Visit the religious sites of the Tomb of Said Abu Bakr el Mirgani and the Mariam de Arit. Debre Sina, near Elabered on the Asmara-Keren road, is also a noteworthy monastery.  Visit the steam railway  Eritrea's railway used to run from Massawa to beyond Agordat via Asmara. After falling into disrepair it has been restored between Massawa and Asmara. To explore the railway sheds and visit the old manufacturing facilities is a railway enthusiast's dream. The skeletal remains of locomotives in varying states of repair sit patiently on tracks in their sheds or on the hand-driven turntable outside. Those that have been lovingly restored by the aging workforce famously brought out of retirement and now in their 80s positively gleam. If you're lucky (or wealthy!) you might be able to experience a small excursion a few kilometres along the track in the direction of Massawa.",africa,,
uganda,"A reputation for political instability and the looming shadow of Idi Amin have long – and unfairly – blighted Uganda’s fledgling tourism sector. Now, though, things are looking up for the East African nation once described as “the pearl of Africa” by Winston Churchill.      And a brief look around is enough to show you why. From the second you step off the plane, the overwhelming impression of Uganda is one of rich natural diversity, friendly locals and a burgeoning cultural scene that is currently producing some of the most exciting artists in Africa.      Culturally, much of the action happens in the capital, Kampala, a hilly urban sprawl ringed by farmland and perched on the muddy banks of Lake Victoria. While most foreign travellers confine themselves to the city centre or the diplomatic quarter, Kololo, its worth venturing into the bustling bars and clubs of Kabalagala, where expats and locals meet for a slug of the local Nile beer and a friendly game of pool.      Away from the capital, Uganda’s towns and cities have little in the way of diversions (although Jinja’s location on the banks of the River Nile has made it a favourite with thrill-seeking rafters). Instead, head west towards the Congo border where, along with the fascinating pygmy people of Fort Portal, Uganda’s natural wonders reveal themselves.      A popular spot for wildlife watching is Queen Elizabeth National Park, which is home to four of the Big Five, a flock of flamboyant flamingos and the rare tree-climbing lions of Ishasha.      The star attraction, though, is the iconic mountain gorilla, which can be found further south in Bwindi Impenetrable Forest. While you’re down there it’s also worth taking a detour to Lake Bunyonyi, a mountain retreat famed for its stunning vistas and freshwater crayfish.      More natural wonders await in northern Uganda, home to the magnificent Murchison Falls, and in the east, where visitors will find the outstanding desert crags and ossified anthills of Kidepo.      Regardless of where you go in Uganda, when it comes to leaving, it will be with a reluctant heavy heart.","Uganda  Attractions in Uganda  Enjoy the charming town of Jinja  No visit to Uganda is complete without a trip to Jinja, the country’s second-largest town and the supposed location of the Source of the Nile. Jinja is also the departure point for a host of adventure activities on and around the river, and a very pretty place in its own right.  Experience Bwindi Impenetrable National Park  This special forest, which was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1994, is a sanctuary for around half the world's remaining mountain gorillas. The park is also home to colobus monkeys, various species of chimpanzee, hundreds of species of birds and many other animals, including snakes, lizards, chameleons and butterflies.  Explore the Budongo Forest Reserve  Situated near Masindi on the road to Lake Albert, the Budongo Forest Reserve is the largest mahogany forest in East Africa and one of the most diverse, with around 465 plant species. The forest is home to Uganda’s largest chimpanzee population, along with approximately 366 bird species and blue monkeys, black-and-white colobus monkeys and the implausibly cute potto (another primate).  Get out and about in Kisoro  With breath-taking views of the volcanic peaks of the Virungas, Kisoro is a popular stop for travellers visiting Mgahinga Gorilla National Park and going gorilla trekking in Rwanda’s Volcanoes National Park. There are many walks outside of the town with lakes, craters and caves to explore and bustling markets every Monday and Thursday.  Get your adrenaline fix at Bujagali Falls  The adventure capital of Uganda, the stretch of the White Nile between Jinja and Bujagali is a playground for rafters and kayakers. Adrenalin-junkies can ride the rapids – where the volume of water is equivalent to ten times that of the Zambezi – while looking out for hippos, crocodiles and monkeys along the way.  Hike through Rwenzori Mountains National Park  One of Uganda’s ten national parks, Rwenzori is regarded as one of the continent's most spectacular. This mountain range in Africa runs almost 120km (75 miles) along the Congolese border and is known for its incredible hiking and climbing opportunities. It’s also a hotspot for wildlife including the endemic Angola colobus monkey.  Kick back on the Ssese Islands  This archipelago of 84 islands scattered along Lake Victoria's northwest shore boasts some beautiful white sandy beaches and famous sunsets. Buggala is the most accessible island, while Banda is more of an old fashioned backpackers retreat. A great place for relaxing with a good book and then sipping a few drinks around the bonfire at night.  Marvel at the wildlife in Murchison Falls National Park  The largest protected area in Uganda, this national park is named after the stunning and dramatic waterfall which cascades 43m (141ft) over the rift valley wall, after travelling an 80km (50 miles) stretch of rapids. Keep your eyes peeled for lions, Nile crocodiles and elephants in the park, or visit rhinos at the Ziwa Rhino Sanctuary.  Safari in Queen Elizabeth National Park  Head to this popular and picturesque park’s remote Ishasha Plains for a rare opportunity to see the feted tree-climbing lions. The park boasts over 90 mammal species in total, and more than 500 bird species. Comprising a wide array of landscapes and ecosystems, it has an almost unparalleled biodiversity rating.  Take time out in Fort Portal  One of the country's most attractive towns, Fort Portal is a hub for travellers wanting to explore some of Uganda's best wildlife destinations, including Kibale, Semliki, Bigodi, Rwenzori and Lake Nkuruba. Try and find time to check out the nearby crater lakes, Karambi Tombs and the recently restored Toro Palace.  Track chimpanzees in Kibale National Park  There are around 325 bird species and at least 60 species of mammals in this impressive park, including 13 primate species. The flora of Kibale National Park is just as impressive with approximately 229 species of trees. Kibale’s most famous inhabitants are its chimps, which you’ll have a high chance of spotting on a guided tracking tour, whilst night treks reveal some amazing animals of the nocturnal kind.  Trek to the summit of Mount Elgon  Head to Mount Elgon to explore sky-soaring mountains, lush forest-clad hills and vast wetlands. Straddling the Kenyan border, this extinct volcano is a must for trekkers, with excellent walks including the Karamoja, the Central Circuit trail and the Sasa River Trail, as well as the Sipi and Sisyi waterfalls.  Visit the lovely Lake Bunyonyi  Almost certainly the prettiest lake in the country, Bunyonyi is surrounded by steeply terraced green hills and scattered with fascinating islands. Like Ssese, it’s a perfect spot for some beach relaxation, but there are also a number of interesting historical sites and activities to experience. During your Lake Bunyonyi trip, take time out to visit the Batwa pygmies to learn about their culture and history.",africa,,
anguilla,"Beyoncé. Paul McCartney. Denzel Washington. Expect to keep good company if you’re holidaying in Anguilla, which has become something of a hangout for the rich and famous in recent years.      Though not the most accessible Caribbean island (geographically and financially speaking), that is precisely why this British Overseas Territory is so appealing for the jet set. There are other reasons, of course. Anguilla also lays claim to some of the finest beaches in the region, as well as some of the most luxurious hotels. Suffice to say, it’s not the place to be penny pinching.      That said, some visitors do just that: favourable tax rates have earned Anguilla a reputation as a place to squirrel away the dollars. However, the island’s true riches lie below the waves, where you will find spectacular coral reef formations and a staggering diversity of marine life: from stingrays to sharks, turtles to tropical fish, there’s as much to see on the seafloor as there is on the shore.      Sailing is another popular pastime in Anguilla and it doesn’t take long to navigate the tiny island and its eight largely uninhabited cays.      If it sounds like a playground for the rich that’s because it is, but that’s not to say more wallet-friendly options don’t exist. There are a range of holiday villas and midrange hotels to suit more modest budgets. A night out needn’t cost the Earth either: potent cocktails go for reasonable prices in Anguilla’s ubiquitous beach bars.      Those who like their food are in for an unexpected treat. The restaurant scene is excellent and there is a surprising range of cuisine, from fine French fare to local dishes. Don’t leave without feasting on buttery Anguillan lobster.     For the culturally minded, Anguilla has many galleries showcasing local art, not to mention a delightfully eccentric museum. Wherever you are though, those beautiful beaches are only minutes away.","Anguilla  Attractions in Anguilla  Absorb Anguilla's past at the Heritage Collection Museum  This simple, but neatly presented museum, has displays on Anguilla’s geology, early Arawak past and its British colonial history, right up to the Anguillian revolution and separation from St Kitts and Nevis. The story is told in artefacts such as model boats, shoes made from tyres and local household items such as brooms and irons.  Descend the Pelican Trail to the shoreline below  The Pelican Trail is a wooden stairway that runs down a steep hillside into a tiny enclosed cove known as Pelican Bay. En route you'll find shaded platforms for resting, great views, and snorkelling and glass-bottom kayaking at the bottom.  Explore the island on the Anguilla Heritage Trail  Self-guided by map, explore a series of historic sights that are signposted around the island. They include the Old Valley Well, the Old Courthouse, Wallblake's Plantation House, and the Big Spring Heritage site with its 1,000 year-old petroglyphs.  Find The Fountain in an underground cave  Spend time exploring Anguilla's many grotto-like rock areas and hidden coves, which are dotted all around the island's 30-odd beaches. However, definitely don't miss out on historic landmark The Fountain, a huge underground cave with a constant supply of fresh water at Shoal Bay. Visits can be arranged via the Anguilla National Trust.  Get pampered at a 5-star spa  Several of the major hotels in Anguilla have spas in dedicated buildings, offering an excellent range of treatments, some with products derived from the region. Most permit outside visitors including the Malliouhana Hotel, CusinArt, the Viceroy and Cap Juluca.  Take a day trip to an offshore island  Day trips, with lunch included, are on offer to the beaches of Anguilla's offshore islands. Sandy Island and its beach bar is just 15 minutes from Sandy Ground Harbour and Prickly Pear is 25 minutes away. Scilly Cay, another favourite for lunch, sits in the bay just off the fishing village of Island Harbour.  Test your swing on a championship golf course  Play a round of golf on a 7063-yard, 18-hole championship golf course designed by Greg Norman. Set overlooking the south coast with lovely views of St Martin, Cuisin Art Golf Club has 13 holes with water features, as well as coastal winds and impenetrable scrub in the rough.  Unwind on beautiful coral beaches  Explore Anguilla's many idyllic, white coral beaches at a leisurely pace. Many of the best, like Rendezvous Bay, Shoal Bay and Road Bay, offer watersports but Crocus Bay and Barnes Bay can't be beaten for peace, quiet and warm cyan seas. Taxi drivers will happily drop you off and collect you later in the day.  Visit Wallblake House, Anguilla's oldest building  Pop into the impressive Wallblake House, a restored plantation house whose foundations date back to 1787, complete with outside kitchens, stables and workers' quarters intact. The oldest building on the island, it is also the only intact plantation remaining in Anguilla. Tours need to be booked in advance.",caribbean,,
tuvalu,"Tuvalu, the world's second-smallest country and, according to the United Nations, one of the least developed, fulfils the classic image of a South Sea paradise. Visitors come to the islands to enjoy the peaceful atmosphere and palm-fringed beaches. Pandanus, papaya, banana, breadfruit and coconut palms are typical. Traditional buildings with thatched roofs can be seen virtually everywhere on the islands.      Most activity is centred in the capital, Funafuti, where the greatest attraction is the enormous Funafuti Lagoon.

malta,"Malta is a relatively small archipelago consisting of three islands (Malta, Gozo and Comino) and other uninhabited islands. It has an area of 316 sq km (122 sq miles), which is roughly the same size as Munich. Although small in size, Malta has bags of character for visitors at every turn – secluded bays, buzzing nightclubs, exhilarating activities and amazing archaeological wonders all await visitors.      Most tourists come for the weather (there are more than 300 days of sunshine annually) and crystalline waters, which make it one of the best beach holiday destinations in Europe. The best beaches in Malta include the secluded Fomm ir-Rih, the popular Mellieha Bay, the red-sandy Ramla Bay (in Gozo), the breath-taking Blue Lagoon (in Comino), to name but a few. All three islands also fantastic diving experiences and top diving sites include The Blue Hole, Ghar Lapsi and Qawra Reef, along with seven conservation areas around wrecks:    • The Um el Faroud in Wied Iż-Żurrieq    • MV Xlendi, Cominoland, Karwela off Xatt l-Aħmar    • Tug St Michael, Tug 10 in Marsaskala    • The Imperial Eagle off Qawra Point    • Rożi, P29 off Ċirkewwa    • Blenheim Bomber off Xrobb l-Għaġin    • Bristol Beaufighter off Exiles Point      For history buffs, Malta's distinctive appeal lies in its extraordinary 7,000 years of history. This small island is situated in the central Mediterranean, making it a strategic base since the earliest days of navigation and attracting settlers to come and flourish. Today, it is easy for visitors to find mysteries from the Neolithic period, as well as historic marks left by the Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Romans, Byzantines, Arabs, The Knights of St John (aka Knights Hospitaller or Order of St John), and more recently the French and British. Because the past is well-preserved and visible today, Malta has been described as one big 'open-air museum'.","Malta  Attractions in Malta  Beaches  Malta is home to a collection of beautiful and unspoiled sandy beaches including Golden Bay and Mellieħa (both in Mellieħa), Fomm ir-Rih and Għajn Tuffieħa Bay (Mġarr), Bugibba Perched Beach and Qawra Point (St Paul's Bay), St George's Bay (St Julians), as well as Marsalforn Bay, Hondoq Ir Rummien and Ramlal-Ħamra Bay (on Gozo Island).

nova scotia,"Nova Scotia isn’t quite an island, but it feels like one, with its alluring coastline, fascinating cultural heritage and exquisite seafood.      Mellow coves, sandy beaches and fossil-rich cliffs punctuate the 7,400km (4,600-mile) seashore. You can catch back-flipping humpback whales riding the waves or launch a kayak and weave among gambolling seals and porpoises. Equally thrilling is a bumpy raft ride on the tidal bore at the Bay of Fundy, home to the world’s highest tides, where 160 billion tonnes of water barrel in and out twice a day.      Sampling some of the delicious sea produce is a must, whether pan-fried scallops in Digby or fresh-from-the-ocean lobster at Hall’s Harbour Pound.      For the ultimate road trip, cruise the 300km (186-mile) Cabot Trail around Cape Breton Island, where gorgeous beaches and dreamy highlands lure you out of your car. In fact, why not take your time and do the whole thing by bike?      There are no prizes for guessing which nation Nova Scotia takes its name from. If your Latin has failed you, the ubiquity of kilts, energetic Highland dancers and boot-stomping fiddle bands might give it away. Not to mention the province’s very own Gaelic college.      It’s not just the Scots who’ve made this their home though. Early French settlers left their mark too, and you can practise your français in pretty Acadian villages in the southwest of the province. Alternatively, paddle a canoe through waterways used for thousands of years by the Mi’kmaq aboriginal people in Kejimkujik National Park.      Thirsty? Halifax claims more pubs per capita than anywhere else in Canada and the craic is second-to-none. So grab a pew, order a pint of Alexander Keith’s, and get blethering.","Nova Scotia  Attractions in Nova Scotia  Discover a UNESCO World Heritage site  This German settlement was established in 1753 and is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Hunt for rocks and fossils  Eagle-eyed visitors can scavenge for amethyst, agate, quartz and jasper around Parrsboro. Fossil hunting enthusiasts can also sign up for a cliff tour at Joggins.  Learn about Halifax's military history  The Citadel, a star-shaped masonry fortress built in 1856 on the site of a 1749 structure, is one of Canada's most visited National Historic Sites. Dominating Halifax, it is known for its kilted regiment of historical re-enactors, and good views of the city and harbour.  Navigate the shoreline  The Lighthouse Route travels along the South Shore, where seafaring traditions are especially strong. The Evangeline Trail, a rural road that goes through the beautiful Annapolis Valley, is known for its orchards, forts and Victorian mansions.  Pick up the Gaelic accent  More evidence of Nova Scotia's close ties with Scotland: street signs in Pugwash are in English and Gaelic and highland games are held annually in Antigonish.  Revel in landscapes and landmarks  Nature lovers should head for Cape Breton Island. While there, visit Cape Breton Highlands National Park for spectacular scenery; the Fortress of Louisbourg, Canada's largest historical restoration; and Baddeck, which is home to the Alexander Graham Bell National Historic Site and Bell's final resting place.  Splurge in Halifax's shops and bars  You can find excellent shopping, nightlife and restaurants in both the old and new sections of Halifax.  Spot bears and bald eagles  You can spot some of the province's most characteristic wildlife in the Provincial Wildlife Park at Shubenacadie; among other creatures, the park shelters moose, bears, cougars, coyotes and bald eagles (of which it has a particularly high population).  Take a tour of Halifax Harbour  The provincial capital, Halifax, claims to have the second-largest natural harbour in the world (after Sydney in Australia) and has a long and distinguished history as a naval and military base. Harbour tours are available.  Taste the Celtic flavour  The Halifax Highland Games and Scottish Festival celebrates Nova Scotia's Celtic influences. It is held every summer on Dartmouth Common, across the Narrows from Halifax. For another taste of the province's Old World heritage, try the Celtic Colours International Festival on Cape Breton Island in October.  Try deep-sea fishing  Anglers intending to fish in Nova Scotia's 9,000 freshwater lakes require a valid fishing licence, obtainable from any provincial Department of Natural Resources office or from one of almost 700 authorised vendors. Note that a separate licence is required for salmon. Deep-sea fishing is popular, with charter boat trips available from several places, including Halifax.

bangladesh,"India’s sleepy eastern cousin, Bangladesh slumbers gently under monsoon skies at the mouth of the Jamuna River, one of the world’s great deltas. Formerly East Pakistan, this intriguing backwater gained independence in 1971 after a civil war that still plays a major role in the national psyche.      An influx of tourists was predicted following independence, but this has yet to materialised, meaning visitors have Bangladesh’s many and varied attractions to themselves. Those attractions range from Mughal palaces and gleaming mosques to palm-fringed beaches, tea-plantations and jungles full of snarling Bengal tigers.      Bangladesh’s frenetic capital, Dhaka, was once the main port for the whole of Bengal, and its rickshaw-crammed streets present a faded mirror to Kolkata across the border. Dhaka is a city of rain-washed colonial buildings, gaudy film posters, docksides thronging with boats and the constant cacophony of car horns and rickshaw bells. It can be a shock for the senses, but the blow is softened by friendly, inquisitive locals and delicious Bengali cuisine.      South of Dhaka, the Jamuna River breaks down into a tangle of jungle-choked waterways as you enter the Sundarbans, one of the last refuges of the Bengal tiger. Here, as elsewhere in Bangladesh, the best way to get around is by river – legions of boats ply every waterway, from tiny coracles to the paddleboat ‘rockets’ that chug between Dhaka and Kulna.      The south of Bangladesh is something else again; tropical beaches give way to forested hills that hide a host of Buddhist and animist tribes. Then there’s Sylhet, in the heart of tea plantation country, where foreign remittances have built a miniature version of England amidst the monsoon hills.      Above all else, Bangladesh is place to leave the mainstream travel map. Let the crowds mob the beaches of Goa and the forts of Rajasthan; in Bangladesh, you won’t have to queue to be amazed.","Bangladesh  Attractions in Bangladesh  Experience Dhaka’s historic heart  The beating heart of the Bengali capital, Old Dhaka is a sprawl of crowded alleyways, unravelling onto the waterfront at Sadar Ghat. As well as famous monuments – Ahsan Manxzil, Lalbagh Fort – the streets are crammed with atmospheric markets selling every imaginable product, and on the edge of the old city is the Baitul Mukarram Mosque, the 10th biggest in the world.  Find peace on the sands of Kuakata  The long sandy beaches of the far south are better known, but locals claim the finest stretch of sand is at Kuakata, a low-key resort on the edge of the Sundarbans. Close to Barisal, Kuakata offers sparkling sand, swaying palms, ramshackle seafood cafes, laid-back beach resorts, and few of the crowds who mob the sands at Cox's Bazaar.  Follow in the footsteps of the first Bengalis  The archaeological sites of Paharpur, Mahasthanagarh and Sherpur, close to the town of Bogra in the country's northwest, reveal the ancient Hindu and Buddhist origins of Bangladesh. The Somapura Mahavihara was one of the most important Buddhist monasteries of the ancient world and the remains of its vast central stupa dominate the ruins at Paharpur.  Relive a golden age in Sonargaon  About 25km (15 miles) southeast of Dhaka, sleepy Sonargaon offers respite from the chaos of the capital. This was the capital of eastern Bengal under a string of nawabs and sultans and their faded mansions still line the main road in the village of Painam Nagar. Nearby are ruined mosques and a fine folk-art museum in the historic Sadarbari villa.  Ride a rickshaw through Dhaka  With its crowds, bazaars and rickshaw traffic jams, Bangladesh's capital is famously fast-paced and frenetic. The best place to feel the vibrations of the Bengali capital is Sadar Ghat, where passengers spill from boats day and night in a continuous human tide. More laid-back sights include the uncompleted 17th-century Lalbagh Fort and the stately Ahsan Manzil Palace and Museum.  Ride the Rocket  One of Bangladesh's most iconic experiences is the overnight boat trip on the Rocket – the nostalgic paddle-wheel ferry that has piled the waterways between Dhaka and Khulna for more than century. Today, boats travel only as far as Morelganj, but the trip is perhaps the most atmospheric way to experience the pace of life on Bengal's waterways.  Sample the cultural melting pot of Maheskali Island  The southern beach resort of Cox's Bazaar attracts local holiday makers in droves, but a more interesting experience can be had off-shore on Maheskali Island, a pilgrimage destination for Muslims, Hindus and Buddhists. Rickshaws wait at Kasturi Ghat to ferry new arrivals up the hill to the Hindu Adinath temple, which offers panoramic views of the island.  See Britain-meets-Bengal in Sylhet  The divisional capital of Sylhet has grown wealthy from the money sent home by Bengalis working in the UK. Tea is the big local industry, and many workers in the tea plantations are tribal Manipuri and Khasi people. Some estates are within walking distance of the centre and the revered mausoleum of Hazrat Shah Jalal, a 14th-century Sufi mystic.  Sip a brew in Sylhet  Sylhet Division, northeast of Dhaka, is known as 'the land of two leaves and a bud' because of its long tradition of growing fine Indian teas. The best-known estates are found close to the town of Srimangal, which sits amidst a sea of green tea bushes. Many estates offer tours and tastings of the flavoursome local brew.  Spot tigers in the Sundarbans  The elusive Bengal tiger stalks the rain-soaked waterways of Sundarbans National Park, a vast area of estuarine forest sprawling out into the Bay of Bengal. Spilling over into India, this is the largest mangrove forest in the world, and boat trips offer glimpses of deer, monkeys, exotic birds, and for the lucky, the Bengal tiger himself.  Step into the time of sultans in Bagerhat  In the southwest, near Khulna, the town of Bagerhat was the 15th-century capital of the warrior saint Khan Jahan Ali, and the countryside is dotted with the remains of his holy city. The 15th-century Shait Gumbad, the so-called 'Sixty-domed' Mosque, is the most well known structure, but there are more ancient mosques nearby, as well as the mausoleum of Jahan Ali.  Stroll the sand at Cox’s Bar  In Bangladesh's far south, close to the border with Myanmar, Cox's Bazaar is where Bangladesh comes to unwind. The world's longest and broadest beach, Inani Beach sprawls south from the city, providing a favourite promenading spot for local holidaymakers. Foreign visitors use the city as a leaping off point for nearby St Martin's Island, perhaps Bangladesh's most perfect beach paradise.  Visit the Buddhist villages of Kaptai Lake  Rangamati is the gateway to the Buddhist tribal villages of Kaptai Lake, whose culture owes more to neighbouring Myanmar than to the rest of Bangladesh.  Boats trips on Kaptai Lake visit Chakma villages and Myanmar-style pagodas, taking in the idyllic green scenery.  Wander the bustling lanes of Chittagong  The second largest city in Bangladesh, Chittagong is ringed by coconut groves and sandy beaches. This is the gateway to the fascinating Chittagong Hill Tracts, home to Bangladesh's Buddhist hill tribes, and the resort beaches of the far south, but there's plenty to see in the city, including museums and 17th-century mosques.",asia,,
tibet,"Hidden high on the roof of the world, Tibet is a land of golden monasteries, spectacular mountain scenery and a deep spiritual heritage that lives as much in our imagination as it does in the remote Himalayas.      Of course, it’s hard to ignore the complex political situation, with Tibet seen both as occupied territory and an integral part of China for the best part of a century depending on who you talk to. This contentious situation can affect your freedom of movement in the country, and so it’s wise to plan your itinerary and do your research well in advance.      Once you’ve crossed these barriers, however, an enthralling, unique realm awaits.      Many travellers will be drawn to Tibet by the spectacular Buddhist temples, ageless monasteries perched on cliff edges and robed monks chanting peacefully. With the amount of reverence and faith among Tibetans, Tibet truly feels like one of the most spiritual places on Earth.      Beyond the zen vibes, Tibet’s nature is also life-affirming. Stunning high-altitude scenery and huge blue salt lakes borne on high towards the heavens are the highlights, while epic journeys beckon. Try the world's highest railway trip, for example, or take the classic overland drive across the Himalayas to Kathmandu in Nepal.      A recurring highlight wherever you go is the Tibetan people, always quick with a smile, from visiting bands of pilgrims to nomads in their yak-hair tents. Be sure to try beer in a Lhasa teahouse, or to accept a monk’s offer of yak-butter tea. The Tibetans’ openness and warmth in the face of political oppression is remarkable.      Once the very definition of remote, arduous and forbidden travel, Tibet is now surprisingly well connected by road, plane and even rail links. Massive change is reshaping the politically troubled plateau but complicated travel restrictions make independent travel tricky, so do plan ahead.","Tibet  Attractions in Tibet  Changtang  Home to herds of wild ass, dramatic grasslands and turquoise salt lakes, Tibet's remotest, emptiest and most beautiful corner is its northwestern wilderness.  Unless you are mounting a full-on expedition, the best way is to pass through along the northern route to Mt Kailash, preferably camping at the lovely lakes en route.  Everest Base Camp  Don't tell the Nepalese, but the views of Everest from the northern Tibetan side are much more dramatic than from its southern neighbour. Bed down at Base Camp, visit Tibet's highest monastery or just stare at the North Face of the world's highest peak. Adventurers can trek in from Tingri or Kharta.  Ganden Monastery  The spectacularly situated monastery at Ganden offers perhaps the best day trip from Lhasa. Almost completely destroyed in the 1950s the complex has been largely restored, though political tensions remain. A lovely kora (pilgrim circuit) that offers incredible views only adds to the site's charm.  Guge Kingdom  Amateur archaeologists will feel their pulse quicken at this forgotten centre of Buddhist culture hidden in Tibet's remote far west. Underground staircases and tunnels link halls of spectacular Kashmiri-influenced Buddhist art, while the surrounding hillsides of cave complexes and crumbling ruins offer some genuine exploration.  Gyantse Kumbum  This unique eight-storied stupa is one of Tibet's architectural masterpieces. Paths wind around and up through the stupa, passing dozens of niches filled with impressive Buddhist art and iconography. Views from the roof look towards Gyantse fort, taken by the British army under Francis Younghusband in 1904.  Jokhang Temple, Lhasa  The sacred Jokhang complex is Tibet's spiritual heart. Join the awed Tibetan pilgrims as they spin prayer wheels and shuffle silently around medieval chapels thick with the smell of yak butter and juniper incense.  Mount Kailash  Sacred to over a billion people, iconic Mt Kailash is perhaps Asia's most enigmatic mountain, drawing pilgrims from across the world on a rugged but stunning overland trip to Tibet's far west. Join pilgrims on the three or four-day trek around the mountain before relaxing on the spectacular shores of Lake Manasarovar.  Nam-tso  One of Tibet's most spectacular natural sights, this huge salt lake sits like a chunk of turquoise beneath a line of snow-capped 7000m peaks. Dotted with black yak-hair nomads' tents and pilgrim paths it's a great opportunity to taste the rugged beauty of wild northern Tibet.  Sakya Monastery  An easy detour off the Friendship Highway leads to this towering, brooding 13th-century monastery. Politically important for centuries, the monastery still contains towering Buddhist statues, a deeply atmospheric main prayer hall and plenty of surrounding chapels to explore.  Samye Monastery  Situated between the mountains and the sandy banks of the Yarlung Tsangpo River, the uniquely circular walls of Tibet's oldest monastery enjoy one of the loveliest locations in Tibet. The fact that Samye lies at the end point of Tibet's most popular trek (four days from Ganden) just adds to the magic.  Sera and Drepung Monasteries, Lhasa  Tibet's two largest monasteries are almost miniature towns in themselves, complete with colleges, prayer halls, kitchens and debating halls. Don't miss the debating monks of Sera or the pilgrim circuit at Drepung.  Sichuan-Tibet Highway  The remote mountain roads through the Kham region of eastern Tibet are some of the world's wildest and most beautiful. The overland trip takes you through another Tibet; of forested alpine valleys and lush meadows, deep canyons and rich biodiversity. Neither easy nor cheap, this is an adventure of a lifetime.  Take a trip along Friendship Highway  The ancient 870km (541 miles) trade route between Lhasa and Zhangmu  ranks as one of the world's great road trips. The rollercoaster ride takes you over prayer-flag-strewn high passes and past huge lakes before dropping into the spicy lushness of the Indian subcontinent. Take a week and savour the many monastery sights en route.  Tashilhunpo Monastery, Shigatse  Shigatse has long been political and religious rival to Lhasa, so it's not surprising that the seat of Tibet's number two religious leader, the Panchen Lama, is a monastic town of huge golden stupas and a colourful annual ceremony that sees the hanging of a colossal thangka (religious painting).  Visit Potala Palace, Lhasa  The breathtaking former abode of the Dalai Lamas towers like a fortress above Lhasa, while the labyrinthine monastery-like interior below houses some of Tibet's great treasures. Crowds can be thick so you need to book in advance a time to visit.",asia,china,
fiji,"A friendly Fijian welcome and broad smiles await you in this tropical paradise of beautiful beaches, glowing blue lagoons and swaying palm trees. Renowned for stunning sunsets,  breathtaking waterfalls, awesome surf and pristine rainforests, Fiji unsurprisingly draws thousands of visitors to its shores each year.      Chief among the attractions has to be the cyan-blue sea. As you enter the Fijian airspace you will no doubt be greeted with a carpet of glistening turquoise reefs, fringing unspoilt confetti of sandy, lush islands. It may look tranquil and majestic, but beneath the surface it's teeming with life. Amid multicoloured reefs, the intrepid can explore over 1,000 fish species. You'll also find five of the seven species of sea turtle as well as sharks, dolphins and whales around Fiji. You can't come here without snorkelling or diving at least some of the time.      Beyond the marine life, you'll find ample opportunities to go hiking, with an abundance of forests and trails following scenic view points and waterfall pools. Nature lovers will revel on the island of Kadavu, which is practically roadless, with a smattering of local villages and plantations connected by untrodden pathways. Even more beauty can be found on the verdant island of Taveuni which boasts thick jungle vegetation and tropical flowers. Birdwatchers will love the Fijian islands for its plethora of winged species including the famous yellow and red-breasted musk parrots.      Perhaps above all, though, it's the people that make Fiji. Comprising more than 300 islands, the country is a vibrant melting pot where East Indian, Polynesian, Melanesian, Chinese and European cultures converge to form a unique cultural medley. English is widely spoken, which means communication is a breeze. You can also expect locals to give you the warmest welcomes, and don't be surprised if they invite you into their homes and invite you to share a cup of Kava.      If, somehow, you tire of the beaches and wildlife of the islands, you'll find Suva to be an intriguing cultural hub, with a jumble of colonial and modern architecture. Laid out over lush hills by the sea, the capital is home to half of the country's population and is the biggest city in the South Pacific. If you like to party, Fiji isn't all laid-back, with Suva offering up a large dose of irreverent nightlife.      Brimming with colourful attractions, awe-inspiring scenery, friendly people and cultural and sporting activities aplenty, Fiji offers something for everyone. From the wanderlust-suffused traveller to the hedonistic sports junkie, this archipelago at the crossroads of the South Pacific is tourist heaven. And, best of all, there’s an array of accommodation and activities to suit all tastes and budgets.","Fiji  Attractions in Fiji  Church of Saint Francis Xavier: A fascinating blend of cultures  Perched atop a mangrove forested hill on Fiji’s main island, Viti Levu, The Church of Saint Francis Xavier overlooks the King’s Road. Its architecture is a unique marrying of European and Fijian culture with a traditional stone façade, concealing three beautiful frescos, flanked by straw mats instead of pews. The murals were originally commissioned by the former chaplain to Austria’s famous Von Trapp family (of The Sound of Music).  Diving: Explore Fiji’s magnificent underwater world  Fiji has been called “the soft coral capital of the world” and few seasoned divers will deny that Fiji has some of the finest scuba diving in the South Pacific. Less touristy than the Great Barrier Reef, Fiji still boasts a relatively untouched diversity of habitat and marine life which some divers call paradise. Diving is possible all year, with the best sites including Beqa Lagoon, Rainbow Reef or the Somosomo Straits with the famous Great White Wall. Wherever you end up, you can be sure to have your pick of underwater caverns, swim throughs and the 390 coral species that spread out for thousands of miles around.  Fiji Museum: Spend the day exploring Fiji’s melting pot past  Located in Thurston Gardens in Suva, the Fiji Museum houses an extensive archaeological collection, which dates back 3,700 years and includes cultural objects representing both Fiji's indigenous inhabitants and other communities that have settled in the islands. Of particular note is the rudder of the HMS Bounty, which was destroyed by mutineers.  Garden of the Sleeping Giant: A tranquil retreat  For peace and tranquillity, the Garden of the Sleeping Giant on the road between Nadi and Lautoka, at the foot of the Sabeto Mountains is the place to go. With dreamy lily ponds, forested boardwalks and pristine lawns, this garden soothes the senses and feeds the soul. Formally a private orchid garden, the site is now open to the public, housing a dazzling array beautiful orchids and flowering plants.  Kadavu: Keep an eye on the wildlife  This paradisal wonderland of Kadavu is a veritable bounty of native flora and fauna, untouched by intrusive animal and reptilian species. Small villages scatter the lush vegetation, just waiting to be discovered by a network of forested footpaths. Along these paths you can discover an abundance of native birds and jungle flowers. It is also a world-renowned diving spot with the Great Astrolabe Reef, a sensory feast for divers and snorkellers alike. This reef is one of the largest on the planet and contains a deluge of coral, fish, manta rays, turtles and fish species.  Meke: Witness traditional Fijian dancing  Witnessing a meke, the traditional dance of indigenous Fijian people, is almost unavoidable, particularly if you’re staying at an island resort. Mekes are performed by women, who cover themselves with fans, and men, who dance with spears or clubs. It is a heady combination of dancing and storytelling with rhythmic clapping and chanting. Typically, the performers dress in the national costume of flower leis, grass skirts and tapa cloth. Other traditional dances include the Poi Dance, which is typically performed at fire-walking shows.  Mount Batilamu: Climb the sleeping giant  Fiji isn’t short of spectacular vistas, but for unparalleled panoramas take a day trip from Nadi or Lautoka to scale the “sleeping giant”, also known as Mount Batilamu. The ascent winds through the Koroyanitu National Heritage Park, through small villages, past watering holes and up vertiginous summits. From the top, panoramic views stretch all the way to the Mananuca and Yasawa island groups and the ascent offers a chance to dip into one of the many waterfall pools.  Naihehe Caves: Explore the world of tribal tradition  Situated deep in the Sigatoka Valley lies a wondrous natural cave linked with Fiji’s last cannibal tribes. Once a fortress of Fiji's last pagan priest, the caves contain a priest chamber, sacred pond and great Cathedral Chamber. The caves are still considered sacrosanct today and locals frequently go there to pay tribute to their ancestors.  Rewa River Delta: Cruise through mangrove forests  Mangrove forests can be found along Viti Levu’s gorgeous coastline and are extremely rich in wildlife. Take a boat trip along the meandering corridors of the mangrove forests, up the Rewa River Delta, for a chance to see myriad bird species and remote fishing villages.  Sabeto Hot Springs and Mud Pool: Relax in a natural spa  The hot springs of Nadi are believed by locals to have healing properties. We can’t qualify that, but we do know the three pools, warm mud baths and lush backdrop make for a seriously relaxing experience. Located in Sabeto Valley, the springs are run by friendly locals who will help you get muddy.  Sigatoka Sand Dunes: Explore a unique eco-system  One of Fiji's natural highlights, the spectacular sand dunes lining the Sigatoka River have been in the making for millions of years. Windblown and rugged, these dunes are a far cry from those of the Sahara – the sand is grey-brown in colour and covered with vines and shrubs. They are also one of the largest burial sites in the Pacific.  Sri Siva Subramaniya Temple: Find your inner peace  A must-see for culture vultures, Nadi’s Sri Siva Subramaniya Temple is the largest Hindu temple in the Southern Hemisphere. Illustrating the architectural diversity for which Fiji is well known, the temple is dedicated to the deity Murugan whose statue, specially carved in India, is housed in the main temple.  Surf’s up: Hit the waves in Viti Levu  The largest of the islands that make up Fiji, Viti Levu offers some quality waves for surfers of all levels. A number of surfing camps are springing up off the southern and western regions of the islands, offering lessons, day trips and excursions to the best breaks. There's surf throughout the year with the best swells out of the south from March to October. Fiji's waves typically break on coral reefs and a small day trip could take you to some seriously fantastic surfing spots. Most of the well-known spots are off Viti Levu and can often only be reached by boat.  Taveuni: Hike the garden island  Taveuni has hiking trails all over the island, but the Lavena Coastal Walk is considered one of the best. Start on the soft, sands of Laverna beach and let yourself continue through a black volcanic sandy enclave, through to lush jungled inclines and a plunging waterfall. Serious hikers can test their mettle on the Vidawa Forest Walk and enjoy remarkable coastal views. The trek up to Lake Tagimaucia and the Des Voeux ascent are also challenging climbs.  The Arts Village in Pacific Harbour: A slice of Fijian hospitality  A fusion of historical fantasy and contemporary arts, Pacific Harbour’s quaint Arts Village is well worth a visit. Take a boat tour around the lagoon, wander around the temple and explore the market, where you will be treated to various cultural performances including traditional displays of Fijian fire walking. The village also houses Fiji’s largest swim up bar, from where you can sip a tropical cocktail and watch Fiji’s talent perform on the nearby stage.  The Mamanuca Islands: Take to the wind  Ideal water conditions, big waves and a year-round breeze conspire to make Fiji an amazing windsurfing destination. Most resorts offer the sport – with instruction too – but if you’re a pro and are looking for something special, the best windsurfing can be found in the Mamanuca Islands. With incandescent waters, unspoilt beaches and swaying hammocks, these islands are the perfect spot to hone your talent.  Water sports: Take to the water   The warm, crystalline waters surrounding Fiji are a playground for watersports enthusiasts. It’s possible to try your hand at diving, swimming, snorkelling, surfing, sailing, fishing, wakeboarding, kayaking and much more on most of the islands. You can also swim in the base of numerous waterfalls found in the forest, coastal parks and reserves. Those in search of a quintessential Fijian seascape may try Castaway Island, a world-renowned dive spot, with a PADI Five Star Gold Dive Centre nearby.",oceania,,
nauru,"If you’re travelling to Nauru, chances are you’re on business, ticking off every country in the world or visiting out of sheer curiosity – for this Pacific island is hardly your archetypal holiday destination.      Although ringed by a beautiful coral reef, the island's interior has been ravaged by decades of phosphate mining, extracted to supply Australia with fertiliser. The sea is also subject to strong currents and rocky pinnacles jut up immediately offshore, meaning swimming and diving are limited.      Tourism has never featured highly on Nauru's agenda, but there are a couple of dilapidated hotels and a handful of attractions: remnants of the Japanese WWII occupation, small beaches, a Chinatown of sorts and the lunar-like landscape of the mined centre. Buada Lagoon is worth checking out too, but swimming here isn’t recommended. You can also organise a deep-sea fishing charter and try your hand at hooking yellowfin tuna, marlin and wahoo.      Nauru’s main road stretches 19km (12 miles) round the country, so it doesn’t take long to see everything, and the climate is stiflingly hot and humid, so flopping under a palm tree is about as much as you can usually manage anyway.      This tiny island republic has gone from being one of the world’s richest nations (in terms of per capita income) to a country on the edge of economic ruin. When the phosphate began to run out, the economy took a downward turn. Consequently, Nauru has been forced to look to other means to keep the country afloat, most recently housing a controversial detention centre for Australia-bound asylum seekers in return for Australian aid.      Nauru’s airline runs a regular service from Brisbane, locals are as upbeat as they can be about the future, and signs of vegetation are beginning to appear inland, but the chances of increasing numbers of intrepid travellers visiting look slim.","Nauru  Attractions in Nauru  Anibore Bay  Relax at Anibore Bay, probably the most beautiful beach on the island (although the sea currents are dangerous).  Anibore Harbour  Take a dip in Anibore Harbour, which is the best bet for swimming, as most beaches are too shallow and rocky.  Australian rules football  Watch the local teams battle it out at an Australian rules football match. The national game is played all through Saturday at the Linkbelt Oval sports field.  Command Ridge  Walk up to Command Ridge, Nauru's highest point, and view an entire country.  Game fishing  Head out to sea and try your luck at game fishing.  Lunar-like landscape  Take a look at the island's bizarre interior, where years of phosphate mining have exposed jagged coral pinnacles, leaving a lunar-like landscape.  National weighlifting team  Look out for Nauru's national weighlifting team in training. The team has had some recent international success, notably at the Commonwealth Games.  Traditional sports  Catch a more traditional sport. The Frigate bird game is the most distinctive, and there are several popular ball games and wrestling games of local origin.  Yaren  In Yaren, spot the remains of Japanese guns, bunkers and pillboxes left over from WWII.",oceania,,
guyana,"Guyana might not be on everyone's bucket list, but with its unspoiled rainforests, golden beaches, sweeping savannahs and meandering rivers, this little-known South American nation offers rich rewards for those daring enough to visit.  Wild and welcoming in equal measure, Guyana's attractions range from the awesome natural splendour of Kaieteur Falls, to the charming, stilted wooden houses of its capital, Georgetown.  Jungle trekking, freshwater fishing and wildlife watching are the big draws, and while few succeed in sighting the country's famously elusive jaguar's, nature lovers will have the opportunity to spot giant anteaters, giant otters and, sticking with the supersize theme, arapaima, the world's largest freshwater fish.  In many ways a trip to Guyana is a jump back in time, a refreshing tonic in a world of instant gratification and constant connectivity. But while the country's tourist infrastructure is almost non-existent, ATMs scarce and holidaymakers rarer than the wild cats that roam the rainforests, pioneering travellers certainly won't be left wanting.  One of the few Caribbean countries that is not an island, multicultural Guyana has more in common with the West Indies than it does South America; from the English and Creole spoken on the streets to the curry dishes served on dinner tables.  Guyanese culture and cuisine reflect the ethnic makeup of the country, which consists of Indian, African and European people, who were brought over to the Caribbean by Dutch and British colonialists. There is also a substantial Amerindian population, which distinguishes it from other parts of the Caribbean.  Travellers looking for a destination with a difference, a country well off the tourist trail, will find Guyana a joy to discover. It's by no means cheap to fly there and exploring the country will require a strong sense of adventure and a willingness to forsake creature comforts. But that's a small price to pay for what Guyana gives in return.","Guyana  Attractions in Guyana  Absorb the ambiance in Georgetown  A visit to Guyana guarantees that every visitor will pass through the colonial capital of Georgetown. 19th century stilted wooden houses line the streets and old Dutch canals line the roads. Guyana is centred around this city, and all aspects of unique Guyanese life focuses on Guyana. Remnants of British, Dutch, Creole and French heritage is apparent on every street across the city. Georgetown is really the only city in Guyana.  Admire the capital’s UNESCO listed City Hall  The 19th century Gothic revival city hall dominates Georgetown's skyline, with its' towering spire and gothic inspired colonial façade ensuring that no other building in the country can come anywhere close to this. The hall was designed by the famous European architect Igantius Scholes in 1887, and was added to the UNESCO World Heritage list in 1995.  Go shopping in Stabroek Market  Stabroek Market, situated in the heart of Georgetown, is famous for its colonial white and brown towering clock and for its friendly vendors. All types of wares are available inside the market, ranging from locally produced jewellery, clothing, sugars, syrups and alcohols. It is easy to get lost in the market, and pickpockets are rife.  Go to court  As with most of Georgetown's buildings, the Victoria Law Courts, named after Queen Victoria, was designed in a colonial wooden style, with its bright red roof and beech coloured wooden beams. The building has been a courthouse since British colonial times, and has seen some of the country's most notorious criminals tried here.  Marvel at the awesome Kaieteur Falls  Try not to leave Guyana without visiting Kaieteur Falls in Kaieteur National Park. Situated on the Potaro River, it ranks with Iguazú, Niagara and Victoria in scale and beauty. The national park is situated on the Guiana Shield, a plateau that is one of the world's oldest and most remote geological formations located in a bio diverse rainforest.  Reel in a giant fish  Game fishing is becoming more popular in Guyana's many inland waterways, however the best place to do this has to be in the Rewa River. Guests must acquire a fishing permit, but rewards are great, with the grand prize being an Arapaima Gigas, the world's largest freshwater fish, or maybe even a Piranha may take the bait.  Salute Queen Victoria  Standing guard just outside of the Victoria law courts stands the statue of the woman who gave her name to so many of Georgetown's buildings, streets and monuments, Queen Victoria. The green hued statue depicts a smartly dressed and crowned Queen Victoria standing proud overlooking her former colonial capital.  Satisfy your sweet tooth in Demerara  The world's last traditional wooden distilling coffey can be found inside the vast sugar distillery in Demerara, where the world famous Demerara sugar gets its name. Visitors have the chance to see how sugar as we know it was made from the sugar canes that have allowed the Caribbean to prosper for centuries. At the end of the hour long tour there is a chance to sample sugars in the souvenir shop.  Sneak a peek at State House  Now home to the President of Guyana, this former Governor's house is one of very few gated mansions in the whole of Guyana. The green and white wooden house with its Georgian sash frames and Demerara windows was built in 1858 and has been a base for power ever since.  Stay with an indigenous tribe  Surama, set in savannah surrounded by forest-covered mountains, is home to the Amerindian community of the Macushi tribe, which welcomes tourists. The village of approximately 230 is now based around the award winning eco-lodge of Surama eco-lodge. The lodge was voted the best hotel in Colombia, Guyana and Venezuela by National Geographic and has been awarded a Caribbean Tourism Organisation Excellence in Sustainable Tourism award.  Take a tour of the Roy Geddes Steel Pan Museum  World famous for his steel pan music, the Roy Geddes museum houses a wide variety of local and Caribbean steel pan instruments, and photographs highlighting Roy's successful musical career. The steel pan was the only non-electronic musical instrument to be produced in the 20th century, and Roy Geddes wants everyone to know why he loves them so much.  Take a walk on the wild side  Iwokrama rainforest is one of Guyana's largest and most dense, and a rainforest canopy walkway allows visitors to walk above and amongst the towering trees densely packed together with accompanying wildlife and fauna. The views from the walkway out across the forest are spectacular.  Unwind in the Botanical Gardens  Perhaps the most famous garden in Guyana, and home to the kissing bridge where young couples can be found at all times of day, this quiet city centre sanctuary is a must see. Guyana's first Governor, President and Executive President are all buried here next to the pond, and a gold clock pays homage to George Samuel Jenman, a superintendent of the gardens from 1879.  Visit the Guyana National Museum  One of Guyana's only museums, and by far the largest, this building houses some of the world's most important artefacts, both from Europe and the Americas. In 1864 a fire destroyed all of the original collections, including British gemstones, indigenous woods and animal specimens; today the museum houses a collection of artefacts from all corners of the world, including locally collected rainforest specimens.  Visit the world’s tallest wooden church  The Anglican cathedral of Guyana, located at the heart of Georgetown is unmistakably colonial in style. It is the tallest wholly wooden church in the world and was designed by Sir Arthur Blomfield in 1892. Inside the cathedral, with its Gothic arches and wooden pews, hangs a dazzling chandelier which was donated by Queen Victoria when she ascended to the throne.",south america,,
falkland islands,"Nineteenth-century shipwrecks and a plethora of marine life are among the attractions awaiting visitors to the Falkland Islands. Although these islands are perhaps best known as the battleground of the eponymous 1982 war between Britain and Argentina, but this archipelago in the Atlantic is an intriguing and relaxing holiday destination.  Situated nearly 500km from Patagonia, the Falklands – or Islas Maldivas, depending on who you talk to – are a frequent stopping point on Antarctic voyages, and with such an abundance of rare animal life, it's not hard to see why. There are two main islands, East and West Falkland, as well as several hundred islets. Wildlife lovers will find strewn among them five different species of penguins (including macaroni, king, Magellanic, gentoo, and rockhopper), as well whales, and sea birds. Head to Volunteer Point for the islands' largest group of king penguins, while there are a predictably vast amount of sea lions to be found on Sea Lion Island.  Reminders of the 1982 conflict do remain, with battlefields, such as Goose Green and Pebble Island, now tourist attractions. Also claimed by Spain, France and Argentina over the years, the Falklands have been British Overseas Territory since 1833. Argentina famously still contests this status and there have been recent political ramblings on the matter by that country's government. However, a recent referendum found that an overwhelming majority of the 3,000 or so islanders want to remain under British rule.  Most of the Falkland Islands' population live in the capital Stanley, over whose harbour much avian life can be seen circling above the waves. More than a thousand members of the British military live at the Mount Pleasant Base. There's a rural feel to the islands, with hamlets and sheep abounding, while you'll find no traffic lights on the Falklands' country roads. There are more than a dozen endemic plants, including Felton's flower, thought to be extinct in the wild until recently, which gives off a whiff of caramel. Also, look out for the ubiquitous snakeplant.","Falkland Islands  Attractions in Falkland Islands  Explore the capital, Stanley  With its traditional boozers, Stanley has more than a whiff of Great Britain about it. If you fancy getting to know the locals order a pint and prop up the bar. If you're feeling peckish there are a various restaurants to sate your appetite. Fancy a flutter? Then head to the local racecourse to watch the nags.  Go birdwatching  The penguins are, of course, the headline attraction, but for discerning twitchers the archipelago offers the chance to spot other rare and enchanting birds, such as the caracara, albatross and the endemic Cobb's wren. The Falkland's flightless steamer duck is another popular inhabitant and is found nowhere else on Earth.  Learn about the archipelago’s maritime history  Back in the day, sailing ships and steam vessels would regularly call in at Stanley before embarking on the often-precarious journey around Cape Horn. A self-guided Maritime History Trail has been set up in the capital, which takes half a day and leads from Stanley to Cape Pembroke, offering an interesting introduction to the Falkland Islands' birdlife.  Pay a visit to Sea Lion Island  Sea Lion is home to some amazing wildlife, including elephant seals, sea lions and king penguins, as well as killer whales offshore. It is the most southerly-inhabited island, and all areas are accessible by 4x4 or on foot from Sea Lion Lodge.  Peer at the resident penguins  Many migratory birds come to the Falkland Islands, but penguins are the star attraction. There are five species to see in all – the gentoo, rockhopper, Magellanic, king and macaroni penguin – which come to breed on the archipelago in September and depart in March. Be sure to catch a glimpse of these wonderful creatures, which really are adorable.  Saddle up for horse riding  One of the best ways to explore the archipelago, horse riding is available in Port Howard and Port San Carlos. Need more horsepower? Then hire a quad bike, which is another way of exploring the archipelago's dramatic landscape.  Support eco-tourism  Tourist accommodation on the Islands makes every effort to reduce human impact on the environment, as such many of the tourist lodges using wind generators, solar panels and other renewable energy. Farms and tourist establishments all over the Islands also tend to grow their own produce.  Take a boat tour of Stanley Harbour  A number of lodges in Stanley have motorboats, which are used for taking guests to see wildlife and places of interest in Stanley Harbour. Tours around Kidney Island and Sparrow Cove can also be arranged. It's worth layering up, as the weather can change quickly at sea.  Visit the battlefield sites  The 1982 conflict looms large over the islands and so it would be remiss not to take a trip to some of the battlefield sites associated with the war (including Wireless Ridge, Mount Tumbledown and Sapper Hill). There are also military cemeteries, memorials and museums dealing with the conflict.",south america,,
georgia,"It’s extremely easy to love Georgia. Formerly famed as the holiday haunt of the privileged elite of the Soviet Union, today’s country is an often overlooked but deeply rewarding travel destination.      A location at the historical crossroads of Europe, Asia, Russia and the Middle East means it still draws influences from all four, and the end result is a heady one. From its mountain-perched monasteries to its valley-floor vineyards, and from its Turkish-style food to its remarkable capacity for hospitality to strangers, Georgia represents a very special slice of the Caucasus.      Capital city Tbilisi, spread along the banks of the Mktvari River, is an enjoyable but sometimes jumbled mix of old and new. Incense-fogged churches and traditional bathhouses share the city with broad avenues and gleaming new towers, while crowning the skyline is a huge statue of “Mother Georgia” – holding a sword in one hand to ward off enemies, and a goblet of wine in the other to welcome friends.      It’s a sign of how tumultuous the country’s history has been, although it’s also worth pointing out that travellers and visitors fall firmly into the “friends” camp. Georgia, incidentally, claims to be the birthplace of wine – viticulture has been practiced here for more than 6,000 years.      Elsewhere in the country, highlights include the remote uplands of Svaneti, the relaxed Black Sea resort of Batumi, the spectacular hiking and horse-trekking trails of Tusheti and the tangled historical web of second city Kutaisi. Talking of tangled, the Georgian alphabet at times resembles a thicket of twisted fish-hooks, and its presence on everything from street placards to the endless marshrutkas (minibuses) that ply the roads adds an extra sense of foreignness to travel here.      Georgia is an endlessly absorbing destination, a beautiful and beguiling nation made all the more rewarding by its bottomless hospitality and friendly inhabitants.","Georgia  Attractions in Georgia  Ateni Sioni Church  Discover the Ateni Sioni Church, 10km (6 miles) south of Gori, which stands in a beautiful setting and is highly prized for its 11th-century stonecarvings and frescoes.  Batumi  Discover the Turkish character of Batumi, the capital of the Ajarian Autonomous Republic. The mosque, 19th-century bath house, Ajarian Museum (with its superb national costume collection), circus, park, botanical garden and the theatre are well worth visiting.  Birdwatching  Birdwatching is another of Georgia's attractions. Approximately 360 species can be found, depending on the season, and the number of birds increases considerably during the spring and autumn migrations. Raptors including the bearded vulture, the long-legged buzzard and the white-tailed eagle can be seen in the Caucasus in summer. In the autumn, the wetlands and mountain steppes in the south near the Armenian border harbour white pelicans, white storks, cranes and Caspian snowcocks.  Black Sea Coast  A seaside resort and port in the southwest of the republic on the Black Sea Coast, Batumi is the capital of the Ajarian Autonomous Republic. Close to the Turkish border (20km/12.5 miles), the town has a decidedly Turkish character. Its charm lies less in any particular sights than in its lush, subtropical setting, among citrus groves and tea plantations, with mountains rising up from the edge of the sea.  Borjami-Kharagauli National Park  Set inside the Lesser Caucasus around the Borjami-Kharagauli National Park, the former health resorts of Abastumani, Saime, Badgadi and Nunisiare are returning to life.  Borjomi  The spa town of Borjomi, 150km (93 miles) west of Tbilisi in the Tori region, developed by Tsar Nicholas in the 19th century as a spa town, produces much acclaimed mineral water. It is possible to hike in the surrounding hills.  Caucasus  The mountain regions of the Caucasus, which extend from the Black Sea to the Caspian Sea, offer numerous opportunities for hiking, skiing, ski touring, heli-skiing and snowboarding. Mount Shkora is the highest summit at 5,068m (16,627ft) and Mount Kazbegi or Mkinvartsveri, meaning 'ice top', (5,033m/16,512ft) is the most attractive to mountain-climbers. The ski resorts of Gudauri and Bakuriani are suitable for skiers of all abilities. Snow cover is guaranteed from December to April.  Daba Monastery  10km (6 miles) from Bakuriani, heading towards Bordzhomi, is the 12th-century Daba Monastery, and nearby a 60m (197ft) waterfall. During the summer it is also possible to visit Lake Tabatskuri, sunk into a hollow high in the mountains.  Georgian Military Highway  Follow the Georgian Military Highway. Leading 220km (137 miles) from Tbilisi to Vladikavkaz (formerly Ordzhonikidze) in North Ossetia (now part of the Russian Federation), this route was built by the Russians in the 19th century to help them control their conquered Georgian territories. The road winds through the dramatic mountain scenery of the high Caucasus, apparently little changed since the 19th-century novelist Lermontov described the route in A Hero of our Time. Sites of interest along the road include the 14th-century Sameba Church (Holy Trinity), overlooking the mountain town of Kazbegi, and the city of Mtskheta. The ski resort of Gudauri is situated along the highway.  Georgian State Museum  Spend some time at the Georgian State Museum on Prospekt Rustaveli in Tbilisi, which houses a collection of icons, frescoes and porcelain, as well as an outstanding display of jewellery discovered in pre-Christian Georgian tombs. The Georgian Museum of Arts, in the centre of town, includes many works by the much-loved 19th-century 'primitive' artist, Niko Pirosmani. The open-air Museum of Ethnography has interesting examples of rural buildings and artefacts.  Gudauri ski resort  The area around the ski resort of Gudauri (120km/75 miles north of Tbilisi) makes a good starting point for summer walks through mountain meadows full of flowers. Even in the lowland areas, eagles soar overhead and spectacular views can be had. The mountains in the south and east can offer more gentle walks.  Horse riding  These regions are also suitable for horse riding and mountain biking, and there are numerous mountain roads and tracks. Special Caucasian horses bred for their endurance and beauty, such as the Kabardo and the Tusheti, are the traditional means of transport in this area. Trips can be started at the mountain resort of Bakuriani.  Lagodechi National Park and Nature Reserve  Lagodechi National Park and Nature Reserve gives tourists the opportunity to trek through the untouched natural ecosystems, beautiful lakes and waterfalls.  Mtskheta  Head for Mtskheta, today a UNESCO World Heritage Site, which remained the centre of Georgian Christianity until the 12th century. The 15th-century Svetitskhoveli Cathedral (Pillar of Life), standing at the confluence of the Mtkvari and Aragvi rivers, was the holiest place in old Georgia. According to legend, the church is built on the spot where Christ's crucifixion robe was dropped to the ground in AD328, having been brought from Jerusalem by a local Jew, and fragments of the robe are said to be kept inside the cathedral.  Narikala Fortress  Enjoy beautiful views of the old part of Tbilisi from the Narikala Fortress, first established by the Persians in the fourth century AD and most recently rebuilt in the 17th century.  Prospekt Rustaveli  Prospekt Rustaveli, Tbilisi's main thoroughfare, features an assortment of stylish public buildings testifying to the city's prosperity at the turn of the century.  Roshka Valley  The Roshka Valley, with its glaciers, and the Chaukhi Mountains also offer strenuous wilderness treks and stark mountain scenery. Lowland walks are possible in both the north and the south of the country.  Samtavro Monastery  Also of interest in Mtskheta are the Samtavro Monastery (still functioning although founded in the 11th century, it is famous as the burial place for the first Christian king, Mirian and his wife Nana) and the sixth-century Jvari Cathedral, the design of which became a prototype for Georgian ecclesiastical architecture.  Shatili  The remote village of Shatili is an outstanding monument of Georgian construction art, located on the main Caucasus ridge; towers are clustered together to create a single fortress.  Sioni Cathedral  The old city in Tbilisi, spreading out from the south bank of the river, has numerous frescoed churches (the most noteworthy being the fifth-century Sioni Cathedral), 19th-century houses with arcaded open galleries on the upper floors, a castle and a surprising number of cafes and enticing tourist shops selling locally produced arts and crafts.  Sulphur baths  Experiment with health-giving sulphur baths in a domed, oriental-style 19th-century bath house just north of the Metekhi Bridge in Tbilisi. Popular with visitors today, Georgian sulphur baths were also frequented by writers such as Pushkin and Tolstoy.  Tbilisi  Enjoy the Mediterranean atmosphere of Tbilisi, the capital, which stands on the banks of the River Mtkvari, in a valley surrounded by hills. The name for the city derives from the word tbili (warm). It is best seen from the top of Mount Mtatsminda.  Trekking  There are five national parks open to visitors to enjoy the country's unique beauty. Trekking and mountain activities are popular in the Tusheti National Park which is a mountainous landscape reaching up to 4,800m (15,748ft). Many of the endemic species can be seen here: the Caspian sea wolf, Caucasian Lynx and many bird species. Tourists can explore the park by foot, horse or vehicle. The Tusheti Villages are protected as historical sites, and are situated here.  Uplistsikhe  Some 10km (6 miles) east of Gori is Uplistsikhe (Fortress of God), a large complex of natural caves. Inhabited from the sixth century BC to the 14th century AD, the caves were gradually transformed into increasingly sophisticated dwellings, shops and public buildings, including the most ancient theatre in Georgia, dungeons and enormous wine cellars.  Vashlovani National Park and Nature Reserve  Vashlovani National Park and Nature Reserve is located in the innermost part of Georgia, where hyena, brown bear, wolf, lynx, griffin vulture and Egyptian vulture can be seen. This park can also be explored by foot or horse, but is open to scientific and educational tourism only.  Wine tasting  Go wine tasting in the Kakheti province in the far east of the country, Georgia's wine-growing region. Apart from being an ancient tradition, drinking wine is also a social skill, with the traditional toast (or Tamada) being the prerogative of the most powerful male at the table.",europe,,
tonga,"From steep, active volcanoes, to low coral atolls, Tonga's 170 islands offer a truly diverse array of backdrops for those seeking a Pacific getaway.      Tonga enjoys a laidback pace of life which visitors find easy to adopt, whether relaxing on one of the magnificent white sand beaches, first-class diving amid the stunning coral reefs or watching the migratory whales return to their breeding grounds (June to November). Many of the islands are uninhabited, and have much emerald flora and secluded coves to explore.      Sightseeing highlights include the Royal Palace on the waterfront in Nuku'alofa, the Mala'ekula (Royal Tombs), and the Anahulu Cave: an underground cavern of stalactites and stalagmites. Tonga is ruled by the last remaining Kingdom of Polynesia. The ruling family of Tonga, the last remaining Polynesian Kingdom, can be traced back more than 1,000 years.","Tonga  Attractions in Tonga  Be amazed by Ha'amonga Trilithon  Ha'amonga Trilithon is a massive stone arch possibly used as a seasonal calendar, erected at the same time as the Terraced Tombs and again made from coral. The Anahulu Cave is an underground cavern of stalactites and stalagmites near the beach of the same name, about 24km (15 miles) from the capital.  Explore the Ha'apai Group  These 68 small islands form the geological and geographical centre of Tonga, and are characterised by white sandy beaches, pristine waters and spectacular coral reefs. The main island, also named Ha'apai, features the quaint old town of Pangai. The famous mutiny on the HMS Bounty in 1789 is said to have taken place in the waters surrounding these islands.  Grab your binoculars and go whale watching  Humpback whales arrive in Tongan waters June to November, to calf and to mate. Special speakers for whale watching are plugged into a hydrophone installed on board the Phoenix catamaran based at Neiafu; only the male whales sing. You can find many reputable whale watching tours that will give you the best possible chance of seeing whales.  Make a royal appointment with the Tongatapu Group  In Nuku'alofa, the capital, sightseeing itineraries should include the white Victorian Royal Palace on the waterfront. When the king is in residence, the royal standard flies from the palace. While visitors are not allowed to enter the palace or gardens, there are good views from the low surrounding walls. The Mala'ekula (Royal Tombs) are situated along Taufa'ahau Road.  Make a splash with the many watersports  Tonga's coral reefs provide great beauty and variety for scuba diving and snorkelling; fully equipped boats and equipment can be hired. There are sandy beaches and excellent swimming throughout the islands, with pools at some hotels. There is a world-standard surfing beach on the island of 'Eua. Niutoua Beach, on the main island, and Ha'apai and Vava'u islands are also good for surfing.  Pay your respects at Langi  On the eastern end of the island are the Langi (Terraced Tombs), 9.5km (6 miles) from the Ha'amonga Trilithon towards Nuku'alofa. The tombs form quadrilateral mounds with huge blocks of stone rising in terraces to heights of 4m (13ft), built for the old Tu'itonga (Spiritual Kings). The stones are of coral, built around AD1200, possibly carried from Wallis Island on large canoes known as lomipeau.  Roam free on 'Eua island  The island of 'Eua is a 10-minute flight away from Tongatapu and has a blend of modern comfort (the island has one hotel and a motel) and traditional island lifestyle. Many species of exotic bird live on the island. ʻEua also counts many huge caves and holes, not all of which have yet been explored.  See the flying foxes of Kolovai  At Kolovai, 18km (11 miles) west of Nuku'alofa, visitors can find the rare flying foxes, dark brown fruit bats, some with wingspans of up to 1m (3ft). The Ha'atafu and Monotapu beaches are also situated at the western end of the island; they are easily accessible and well protected.  See the spectacle of the blowholes  One of the most impressive sights in Tonga are the blowholes, which can be found along the coastline at Houma, 14.5km (9 miles) from Nuku'alofa. Waves send seawater spurting some 18m (60ft) into the air through holes in the coral reef. This stretch of coastline is known as the Mapu 'a Vaea (""the chief's whistle"") by Tongans because of the whistling sound made by the spouts.  Set sail for the Vava'u Group  Lying north of Tongatapu, this cluster of 50 or so thickly wooded islands has one hotel, one motel, one beach resort and four guesthouses. There is a daily one-hour flight from the capital and a weekly ferry service; charters also operate from the harbour at Neiafu, the main town. Attractions include diving, the Fangatongo Royal Residence, Mount Talau and Sailoame Market in Neiafu.",oceania,,
united states of america,"From the soaring skyscrapers of New York City to the dramatic mesas of Arizona, the United States of America is a place of staggering beauty and extraordinary diversity. Nothing prepares you for your first glimpse of Manhattan’s iconic skyline, the yawning expanses of the Grand Canyon or the neon-lit excesses of Las Vegas, just some of the country's many highlights.      You could easily spend a lifetime in the US and still feel like you’ve just scratched the surface. It’s epic on every scale. After all, this is a place where you can watch the thunderous spectacle of Niagara Falls, trek through the soaring Black Hills of South Dakota and cruise along California’s glorious Pacific Coast; where you can ski at Lake Tahoe, go cattle ranching in the Midwest and imbibe live jazz in New Orleans. The options, it seems, are endless.      The USA’s manmade landscapes are nearly as spectacular as the natural ones. New York City boasts some of the most impressive skyscrapers on the planet (think Empire State Building, Chrysler Building, Rockefeller Centre), although the skylines of Seattle, Chicago, LA and Vegas are no less recognisable.      The American people are similarly diverse; from the colourful Cubans of the southeast to the gun-slinging wranglers of Texas and hardy Inuits of Alaska, the country is a melting pot of cultures. Generations of immigrants have shaped the national identity in everything from food and language to music and manners.      Once derided for being boring, the resurgent capital, Washington, D.C, boasts hip new bars, chic boutiques and a burgeoning culinary scene, which are welcome diversions in this theatre of politics. In spring, the city turns pink with cherry blossom – the legacy of a peace offering sent by Japan.      The glorious East Coast retreat of Cape Cod is also not to be missed. Looking around this exquisite peninsula it’s easy to see why the founding fathers, who stepped off the Mayflower here, chose to make this extraordinary land their home. ""God bless America,"" they sang. And God blessed her indeed.","United States of America  Attractions in United States of America  Niagara Falls  The 12,000 year old falls straddle the Canada-US border and are accessible by both sides.

south africa,"With golden beaches, jagged mountains and national parks overflowing with wildlife, South Africa is the Africa you’ve always imagined. While memories of a troubled past remain, the republic is well on the way to regaining its throne as the holiday capital of Africa, visited by nearly 10 million people every year.      Topping a long list of attractions is the republic’s spectacular wildlife and natural scenery. National parks and nature reserves preserve an incredible variety of landscapes – rolling plains, towering mountains, arid deserts, coastal fynbos (shrubland) and pure blue oceans – home to an incredible variety of wildlife, from lions and elephants to great white sharks and playful penguins.      South Africa's cities are no less varied. In the far south, lorded over by iconic Table Mountain, Cape Town is South Africa’s most accessible gateway, with gorgeous beaches, vibrant, multicultural neighbourhoods, famous vineyards, a lively nightlife and fine dining to rival any European capital. You’ll find a similarly cosmopolitan vibe in Johannesburg, the energetic capital, and in beachside Durban, where the hot sunshine is matched by the scorching curries cooked up by the South Asian community.      In between you can lose yourself for days on safari. The undisputed top spot for wildlife spotters is world-famous Kruger National Park, where the Big Five – lions, leopards, elephants, buffaloes and rhinos – are joined by hundreds of other African species.      If the landscape sounds diverse, wait until you meet the people. South Africa boasts 11 official languages and more than a dozen tribes, living alongside communities from Africa, Europe and the Indian subcontinent – little wonder this is known as the Rainbow Nation. This diversity is tangible everywhere, from the architecture and language to the nation’s spectacular cuisine.      Nevertheless, huge inequality remains, still sharply marked out along racial lines. To understand modern South Africa, everyone should visit Johannesburg’s moving Apartheid Museum, and Robben Island prison, where Nelson Mandela was held for 18 years. Or you could join a township tour in Soweto, which, like the rest of your trip, you’ll never forget.","South Africa  Attractions in South Africa  Climb Table Mountain  Cape Town's famous flat-topped mountain is one of the New Seven Wonders of Nature. It provides a magnificent backdrop when you're exploring Cape Town at street level, whilst from the top the expansive views are truly breath-taking at sunset. Hiking up is a popular option for the fit. The lazier way is to take the cable car to the top.  Drive the Garden Route  The popular Garden Route is a casual road tripper's dream, winding along the sunny, scenic and perennially verdant southeast coast between Mossel Bay and the mouth of Storms River. Along the way, pass languid lakes and lagoons, dense indigenous forests and pretty towns including Wilderness, Knysna, Oudtshoorn and Plettenberg Bay.  Experience the ‘real’ South Africa on a township tour  Thanks to a history of racial segregation, the majority of South Africans continue to live in so-called townships. But places like Soweto in Johannesburg and Khayelithsa in Cape Town are much more than living apartheid museums – they are also central breeding grounds for South Africa's vibrant contemporary culture. There are a number of tours that will give insight into both aspects.  Explore the Apartheid Museum  Johannesburg's excellently curated and profoundly moving Apartheid Museum recounts the still-recent history of racially segregated South Africa. Your entrance ticket comes in 'white' and 'non-white' versions, determining which entrance you're allowed to use. A particularly poignant and painful chapter of South Africa's history is revealed through photographs, artefacts, newspaper clippings and film footage.  Frolic among the spring flowers in Namaqualand  The usually bare and arid region of Namaqualand suddenly explodes into colour after the onset of the annual rains between mid-August and mid-September, when wild flowers blanket the landscape like a beautiful mosaic. The West Coast National Park is one of the best places to see the phenomenon, while a number of charming provincial towns provide lodging in the area.  Get the adrenaline going on a shark cage dive  Adrenalin junkies can get up close and personal with the ocean's apex predator. Seal Island in the Western Cape is a favourite hunting ground for great white sharks, with a veritable buffet of penguins, seals and game fish to feast on. From the (relative) safety of a metal cage, you can observe these formidable fish in their natural habitat.  Hike the Drakensburg mountain trails  For outdoor enthusiasts, South Africa has excellent hiking, with trails in the dramatic Drakensberg mountain range among the very best. Pass through ancient yellowwood forests and see even older Bushman rock art along the way, whilst presided over by some rare birdlife; camp in caves if you're hard enough, then abseil your way back down.  Play a round of golf  Got golf clubs and some money to burn? South Africa is brilliant for golfing, and the swanky Fancourt Estate on the south coast has three courses designed by Gary Player, South Africa's most famous golfer, including The Links, described as his greatest design feat. There are hundreds of golf resorts and courses across the country, many in scenic coastal locations.     See the Big 5 on a game drive  The Big 5 (lion, leopard, elephant, rhino and buffalo) is South Africa's greatest attraction, not to mention its favourite tourism marketing moniker. All can be elusive beasts, but chances of sighting these heavyweights and various other crowd favourites are as good as anywhere in safari stalwarts like Kruger National Park, or the exceptionally accessible Pilanesberg National Park.  See what lies beneath at Sodwana Bay  The picturesque coastline and warm waters of KwaZulu-Natal offer superb conditions for underwater exploration.  Sodwana Bay near Durban is a particularly popular base for reef dives among turtles and tropical fish, while Aliwal Shoal and Protea Banks further south are favourites for sharks and wrecks. Courses are available for the newbies.  Spot whales in Hermanus  One of the world's greatest whale watching spots is Hermanus, which hosts an annual Whale Festival and is an easy couple of hours jaunt down the coast from Cape Town. Southern Right Whales migrate along the coast from around June until September and at Hermanus they come so close to shore you can see them breaching from your hotel window.  Stand on the tip of Africa at Cape Point  If you've come this far, you have to go all the way. As the land runs out, you'll reach sheer cliffs and a historic lighthouse towering above the sea. The surrounding conservation area is populated with buck, baboons, zebra, ostrich and indigenous flora. Winding your way back towards town, duck off the main drag to find a number of secluded white sandy beaches.  Surf South Africa’s famous waves  Surfers are spoilt for choice on both the Indian and Atlantic coastlines of South Africa. The surf mecca of Jeffrey's Bay has long drawn the sport's disciples from all over the world, thanks to what many consider the world's best right hand point break. On the outskirts of Cape Town, Muizenberg's Surfer's Corner is another favourite for beginners and pros alike.  Swim with penguins at Boulders Beach  A large colony of entertaining African penguins live on a protected part of Boulders Beach in Simonstown, near Cape Town. A modest entrance fee lets you approach the penguins via various walkways and gives you access to the idyllic beach itself, where you can swim with the penguins between the great granite boulders from which the beach takes its name.  Take a turn around Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens  This immaculate landscaped garden at the foot of Table Mountain was created in 1913 and showcases a wide array of indigenous plants and flowers, particularly those unique to the Cape. There are also a number of manicured lawns perfect for a picnic or the Sunday evening open-air concerts that run throughout the summer.  Taste the Cape Winelands  More than a dozen wine routes and a bevy of wine estates tempt you with delectable tastings and equally excellent cuisine. The views are unfailingly splendid, with whitewashed Cape-Dutch mansions sitting prettily amongst rolling hills and rugged mountains. The wine price tags are equally easy on the eyes. Organised trips from Cape Town let you avoid drunk driving.  Unearth the history of the Anglo-Boer War  At the very end of the 19th century, bloody skirmishes between the Afrikaners, British and Zulus raged across the tranquil rolling hills of KwaZulu-Natal, as evinced today by various gravesites and monuments. Knowledgeable guides lead you around the former battlefields, telling tales that send shivers down your spine.  Unwind in the old Transkei  In the Eastern Cape, the peaceful rural idyll and rustic Xhosa villages of the old Transkei still seem to belong to a different time, and belie a turbulent history from which emerged many of South Africa's most iconic freedom fighters, including Nelson Mandela. Head south to the aptly named Wild Coast and you'll find some of South Africa's best-kept coastal secrets.  Walk in Mandela’s footsteps on Robben Island  A short but often rough ferry trip from Cape Town's V&A Waterfront takes you to Robben Island, where Nelson Mandela and other iconic anti-apartheid activists were jailed for many years. It's a strangely bleak and melancholic place, where tours are still conducted by former political prisoners for an accurate personal account of a life in chains.",africa,,
cyprus,"The legendary birthplace of Aphrodite, Cyprus is every inch the Mediterranean – sandy beaches, ancient monasteries, classical ruins, thyme scented mountains, terracotta pottery and, of course, the obligatory party resorts full of sun-seeking twenty-somethings.      Cyprus has always been at the crossroads between Europe and Asia. In ancient times, a succession of empires squabbled over its seaports and mountain fortresses, which guaranteed supremacy over the eastern Mediterranean. These empire-builders left behind an incredible legacy of historical relics: ancient Greek and Roman ruins, Crusader castles, mighty Venetian city walls and towering mosques and minarets left behind by Ottoman invaders.      Until the 1970s, Cyprus was a sleepy backwater, but a devastating civil war saw the island split into Greek Cypriot and Turkish states. In the south, the Greek Republic of Cyprus grew into a modern European state, while the Turkish north half of the island remains isolated, recognised only by Turkey and well off the mainstream tourist radar.      After Partition, tourist development went into overdrive in the Greek half of the island, with the emergence of Ayia Napa, Protaras, Limassol, Paphos and a string of other package holiday resorts along the southern coast. This is one face of Cyprus – whitewashed villas, sunbathers, banana-boat rides, boisterous nightclubs and hordes of young people enjoying blistering summer sunshine.      Inland, the old Cyprus endures, with beautiful villages full of UNESCO-listed churches, peaceful mountain trails and vineyards that have been producing wines since ancient times. A similar old-world atmosphere pervades in the divided capital, Lefkosia (Nicosia), where quiet lanes lined with Turkish mosques and Byzantine churches come to a sudden halt at the Green Line, the de facto border between the two enclaves.      The north is something else again, more Turkish than Greek, even down to the menus on restaurant tables, but studded with ancient ruins and dramatic Crusader castles. While rampant development is taking place along the coast around Famagusta (Gazimagusa) and Kyrenia (Girne), the remote Karpas Peninsula offers a journey back in time, where ancient ruins spill out onto golden beaches that see more sea turtles than human visitors.","Cyprus  Attractions in Cyprus  Admire the craftsmanship of Cyprus’s Painted Churches  The Byzantine churches and monasteries of the Troodos Mountains are protected as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, in recognition of their extraordinary frescoes and mosaics. Perhaps the most spectacular are Agios Nikolaos tis Stegis at Kakopetria with frescos from the 11th century, and the Church of Archangelos Michael in Pedoulas, with its floor-to-ceiling frescoes of the Archangel Michael.  Amble along the promenade in Larnaca  Stretching for 600m along the seafront, from the marina to Larnaca’s Crusader fort, Finikoudes Beach is one of the island’s favourite promenades. Visitors stroll beneath the palm trees, pausing at local seafood restaurants or sunbathing on the sand. Inland are fascinating museums, including the impressive Pierides Museum, the nation’s oldest private cultural museum.  Enjoy sun, sea and sand in Agia Napa  Once the hedonistic party capital of Cyprus, Agia Napa (Ayia Napa) has 'grown up' in recent years, with a growing number of more sophisticated nightspots, restaurants and cultural venues, as well as the lively beach clubs that still attract hordes of young 20-somethings on tour. The resort also has some of the best beaches and diving opportunities on the island.  Escape to the Akamas Peninsula  With its rugged unspoiled landscape and sandy bays, the Akamas Peninsula is a wonderful place to escape and be at one with nature. Rough dirt roads run around the isthmus from the harbour at Agios Georgios, north of Paphos, to Chrysochou Bay near Polis. The peninsula is home to many species of birds and flowers and rare sea turtles nest here every summer.  Fall in love with Petra tou Romiou  Cyprus was the legendary birthplace of Aphrodite, ancient Greek goddess of love, and this miraculous event has been mapped to Petra tou Romiou (Rock of Aphrodite), a dramatic marble outcrop rising from the turquoise ocean between Limassol and Paphos. Nearby are the imposing ruins of the Temple of Aphrodite, marking the site of the ancient city of Palaipafos.  Find silence and sand on the Karpaz Peninsula  The most untouched quarter of North Cyprus, the scenic Karpaz peninsula juts east towards Turkey, fringed by some of the most unspoiled beaches on the island, most of which see more nesting sea turtles than tourists. Beyond, at the very tip of the peninsula is the splendidly isolated Orthodox monastery of Apostolos Andreas.  Gaze at Gazimağusa (Famagusta)  The magnificent walled city of Famagusta, in North Cyprus, was a wonder of the ancient world, with towering Frankish churches dotted around its sandstone streets. This was the real-life home of the governor who influenced Shakespeare’s title character in Othello, and operated as Cyprus’s most important port before the 1975 war. Today, the churches are picturesque ruins and the city snoozes quietly within its mighty Venetian city walls.  Get lost in Lefkosia (Nicosia)  The Cypriot capital is sliced in two by the Green Line, which divides the island between the Republic of Cyprus in the south and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus in the north. Both sides are studded with ancient mosques, churches and winding streets of stone houses. The historic old town is bound by towering Venetian city walls, and must-see sights include the spectacular Byzantine Art Museum, St John's Cathedral and the Cyprus Museum.  Get lost in Turkish Lefkoşa (Nicosia)  The northern half of the Cypriot capital feels even more lost in time than the Greek half. Its focal point is the grand Selimiye Mosque, formerly the Ayia Sofia Cathedral, which is visible from the southern half of the city. Easing relations between the two governments mean that jaunts across the border are easy today.  Kick back in Girne  Once an important Roman and Venetian port, Girne, formerly known as Kyrenia, is one of the jewels of the Mediterranean. Set around a postcard perfect harbour guarded by a vast Venetian fortress, this picturesque town has played witness to most of the significant events in Cypriot history, from Hellenisation to the arrival of the Crusaders. It’s probably best known for its castles, one of which houses the remains of a merchant ship dating back to the fourth century.  Potter around in peaceful Paphos  The friendliest resort in the republic, pretty Paphos is set around a picturesque harbour, dominated by an imposing medieval fort. It's worth visiting during the summer festival when the sound of opera reverberates around the ancient walls. The city is also famous for the Greco-Roman, rock-carved Tombs of the Kings and the immaculate ancient mosaics in the House of Dionysos.  See Byzantine brilliance at Kykkos Monastery  The largest and most famous monastery in Cyprus, Kykkos was founded in AD1100 by the Byzantine emperor Alexios Komnenos. Set in gorgeous pine forests, the monastery is dedicated to the Virgin Mary and is home to one of the three surviving icons painted by the Apostle Luke. It is also renowned for its stunning museum of icons, woodcarvings and manuscripts.  See a forgotten side to Cyprus at the Hala Sultan Tekke  Tucked away near Larnaca International Airport, the Hala Sultan Tekke was once one of the most sacred shrines in the Muslim world, housing the ancient tomb of the aunt of the Prophet Mohammed. Now quietly forgotten, it's a lovely 19th-century Islamic structure, set amidst date palms beside Larnaca's Salt Lake where migratory flamingos stay in winter.  Shop for Lefkara lace  The charming village of Lefkara, between Limassol and Larnaca, is famous for silver filigree and lace. Legend has it the Italian painter Leonardo da Vinci visited Lefkara in the 15th century and purchased some of its lefkaritika lace for the cathedral in Milan, and in doing so secured its fame.  Ski in the Troodos Mountains  Surprisingly for an island squeezed between Greece, Turkey and Egypt, Cyprus has a busy ski season from January to mid March, when the villages of the Troodos Mountains briefly transform into winter resorts. Both Platres and Kakopetria are handy for the ski slopes on Mount Olympus, but Troodos is actually the nearest resort to the skiing area.  Stroll around Salamis  Just as the south has Kourion, so too does the north have Salamis, the ruins of a sprawling Greco-Roman city that spill out onto a gorgeous sandy beach just north of Famagusta. The site has been somewhat neglected since the island was divided, but the setting is magical, and there’s an impressively restored amphitheatre ringed by the ruins of temples, houses and civic buildings.  Take in the wonders of the Cyprus Museum  Historic treasures have been spilling out of the ground in Cyprus for millennia and many of the finest pieces are proudly displayed in the Cyprus Museum, just outside Lefkosia's city walls. The vast collection includes astonishingly well-preserved Mycenaean pottery, prehistoric Chalcolithic figurines, Egyptian and Roman statues, and carvings from the Royal Tombs at Salamis.  Tramp through the Troodos Mountains  Rising in a dramatic ridge along the middle line of the island, the Troodos Mountains are covered in dry pine forests and dotted with medieval winemaking villages and UNESCO-listed Byzantine monasteries. The peaks are criss-crossed by hiking and cycling trails and in winter, locals ski on the snow-covered slopes of Mount Olympus, the island's highest point at 1,952m (6,404ft).  Walk in the footsteps of Aphrodite  Set in the gorgeous surroundings of the Akamas Peninsula, in the far west of the island near Polis Crysoschous, this isolated freshwater pool is where, according to legend, the Greek goddess of love bathed and enjoyed trysts with the god Adonis. Today, the natural beauty of the surrounding countryside is as much of an attraction as the grotto.  Watch the sun go down from Kourion  Rising above the coastal plain on a rocky plateau, Kourin is perhaps the most spectacularly located ancient site in Cyprus. Spanning the ancient Greek and Roman eras, the ruins are centred on a magnificent amphitheatre, and there are numerous recognisable structures, including an agora (marketplace) and the House of Eustolios, with fine 5th century floor mosaics.",europe,,
slovenia,"Though it may lack the pulling power of its heavyweight neighbours, this charming country is rich in rewards for travellers willing to take a punt.      Sandwiched between Italy, Austria, Hungary and Croatia, this tiny nation occupies a picturesque pocket of Europe, which is characterised by verdant valleys, glacial lakes and snow-capped mountains. Slovenia has been greatly influenced by the countries surrounding it; the baroque architecture, ancient castles and sophisticated cuisine are evocative of western neighbours, while the quaint rural villages, Slavic language and low prices have a decidedly eastern feel.      But, Slovenia has its own identity. The first of the former Yugoslavian states to join the EU, the country is a progressive, forward-thinking nation. Its people are easy-going and welcoming to outsiders.      Most travellers begin their Slovenian adventure in the capital, Ljubljana, a charming university city whose resident academics give the place a youthful vibe. Carved in two by the Ljubljana River, the city is peppered with cafés, independent shops and a gamut of excellent restaurants. It has a laidback vibe and a calm ambiance, unlike most capitals on the continent.      But it’s when you step outside the capital that Slovenia showcases her true charms; the beautiful Adriatic coastal towns; the rolling vineyards of Jeruzalem-Ormož; the picture-perfect lake Bled; the caves of Postojna and Skocjan; and the black ski runs of Kranjska Gora.      Slovenia is a particularly attractive proposition to outdoor enthusiasts and adrenaline junkies, who can try anything from cycling, hiking and paragliding to white-water rafting, caving and mountaineering. Less adventurous visitors can occupy themselves basking on beaches, people-watching in cafés or quaffing some of the country’s excellent wines.","Slovenia  Attractions in Slovenia   Slovenian wine: fall in love with local tipples   Goriška Brda is a breath-taking wine region where the climate of the Julian Alps and the Adriatic Sea meet, giving body and freshness to the local wines – especially varieties such as Rebula.      Vipava Valley is another delightful vineyard area with small, family-run wineries producing top whites from rare and ancient grape varieties such as Zelen, Pinela, Klarnica and Pikolit, and top reds from Merlot grapes.  Bovec: take a plunge  Located in Triglav National Park, this pretty little town is a Mecca for adrenalin-junkies, who flock here in the summer for white water rafting, kayaking and canyoning on the Soča River. In the winter, there is skiing at the nearby Kanin Ski Centre (tel: +386 59179301;http://kanin.si/en/).      The Soča Valley is also home to a thousand year old cheese making tradition; its alpine pastures and dairy farmers keep its heritage alive, offering tastings of the famous Bovec and Tolmic varieties and the Planika cheese making museum (tel: +386 5 3841 000; www.mlekarna-planika.si)  Coastal Slovenia: explore its rugged shores  Slovenia may not boast the longest coast, but what it does have is absolutely beautiful. The coastal towns of Koper, Piran and Portoroz are gateways to the country’s best beaches. They are also home to splendid Venetian architecture, excellent waterfront restaurants and top hotels. Every year the town of Portoroz holds a contemporary art symposium with creations on display in the sculpture park, Forma Viva.

alberta,"Hulking great mountains, sprawling ice fields and emerald lakes are Alberta’s star attractions, but equally thrilling are its dinosaur-strewn Badlands and cowboy heritage.      You’d swear they’ve added a drop of dye to the lakes in the Rocky Mountains. Could they really be such a startling colour? Yes they could, and you need to supercharge your camera battery if you’re going to capture every snap-worthy scene that comes your way.      Whether you’re spotting grizzlies and elk alongside the Icefields Parkway, soaking in Banff’s hot springs, hiking around Maligne Lake or skiing fresh powder at Lake Louise, you’d have to be a Martian not to be bowled over.      This pristine nature sits uneasily next to the controversial oil sands of Alberta’s north, whose modern-day gold rush has fuelled the province’s booming economy. This wealth is evident in cities like Calgary and Edmonton, home to shiny new skyscrapers, flashy restaurants and ever-expanding suburbs.      While much of Alberta beyond the Rockies seems to be an endless vista of prairies topped with a generous sprinkling of lakes, the Badlands pop out like a Christmas cracker surprise. Stripy hills and sandstone hoodoos like giant mushroom stalks conceal many dinosaur bones – in its day this must have been the Cretaceous equivalent of Tokyo or Delhi.      Get your own bones rocking at Edmonton’s summer fiesta, K Days, a 10-day jamboree featuring whirring fairground rides and big-name bands. Or join the cowboy extravaganza that is the Calgary Stampede, when chuckwagon races, bull riding and dazzling stage shows make you yee-haw till you’re hoarse.","Alberta  Attractions in Alberta  Alpine diving  Horseshoe Lake, Patricia Lake and Lake Annette are three of the more popular alpine diving locations. Divers should be experienced and employ the 'buddy' system as the water is cold and often cloudy. The local Rangers Station supplies permits, maps and other information.  Ancient fossils  You can study dinosaur remains on the banks of the Red Deer River, on the 48km (30-mile) Dinosaur Trail near Drumheller. Also near downtown Drumheller is the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology, with hands-on exhibitions and one of the world's largest collections of dinosaur remains.  Banff Summer Arts Festival  Alberta's biggest showcase of the arts (with dance, theatre, film, music and art) takes place over four months annually, all amidst the stunning backdrop of the Rocky Mountains.  Calgary Stampede  Canada's biggest rodeo is billed as the 'Greatest Outdoor Show on Earth'; it is held over 10 days in July each year (www.calgarystampede.com) and attracts many competitors and spectators with stage shows, parades, concerts, rodeo and agricultural exhibits.  Calgary Tower  Calgary's most recognisable feature, the 191m (626ft) Calgary Tower, offers panoramic views of the city, local towns and the Rocky Mountains. Sky 360, the rotating restaurant at the top, is a popular treat (www.sky360.ca).  Cowboy country  The heritage of ranching is alive and well in the town of Cochrane, west of Calgary. Country-and-western-themed shops pepper the downtown area and genuine cowboys still live and work in the region.  Historic site  You'll find Alberta's oldest surviving structure, the historic log cabin of Father Lacombe, in the town of St Albert, 30km (19 miles) northwest of downtown Edmonton. At one time it was the centre of a thriving French-speaking Métis settlement (people of mixed native and European heritage).  Jasper National Park  Jasper National Park was established in 1907 and is the largest of Canada's Rocky Mountains  parks, spanning 10,878 sq kilometres (4200 sq miles). The spectacular scenery is characterised by glaciers, rugged mountains, forests and meadows carpeted with alpine flowers. The park protects a range of fragile mountain ecosystems - elk, moose, bear, bighorn sheep and mule deer are regular sights - and is home to the threatened woodland caribou. Maligne Lake, 48km (30 miles) southeast of Jasper is surrounded by snow-capped mountains and its crystal clear waters are popular for boating and fishing.  Lovely lakes  Alberta boasts characteristic Canadian views: stunning lake scenery in Waterton Lakes National Park, joined to Glacier National Park in Montana to form the Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park; and Banff National Park in the heart of the Canadian Rockies.  National parks  The great outdoors is the main attraction in the southern part of the Rockies; Banff and Jasper national parks are obvious starting points.  Native heritage  The name sounds horrific but the prairie views are unparalleled at Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump, west of Lethbridge. This cliff-top is an ancient jump site, used for 10,000 years to drive buffalo to their deaths, thus providing native people with food, shelter and clothing.  On the slopes  Skiing, both cross-country and downhill, is a major pastime in the Rockies in the winter. Snowboarding is also very popular.  Scenic drive  The Icefields Parkway (Highway 93), running through Banff and Jasper national parks, affords magnificent views of the lakes, forests and the glaciers of the Columbia Icefield. It also provides access to wilderness trails in the area.  West Edmonton Mall  North America's largest entertainment centre and mall, the West Edmonton Mall (www.wem.ca), boasts theatres, restaurants, nightclubs, miniature golf course, ice rink, swimming pool, water park and amusement park, skateboard park, aquariums and bungee jump.  Winter sports  There are myriad ways to enjoy the wonderful mountain scenery, including dog sledding (trekking along mountain trails with teams of huskies under the supervision of experienced guides), ski-joring (being pulled along on skis by teams of huskies), wildlife tracking, snowmobiling and snowshoeing.  Wonderful wildlife  Elk Island National Park (www.pc.gc.ca/elkisland), which traces its roots to 1906, is home to over 44 different kinds of animals (including elk, moose, coyote and beaver), as well as massive herds of plains bison.  Wood Buffalo National Park  Vast expanses of boreal plains are yours to discover at Wood Buffalo National Park (www.pc.gc.ca/woodbuffalo) (Canada's largest national park, bigger than Switzerland), granted World Heritage status by UNESCO in 1983. It provides the perfect habitat for many rare species of wildlife, including the world's largest free-roaming bison herd.",north america,canada,
kansas,"Think Kansas and wicked witches, yellow-brick roads and ruby slippers may spring to mind. But as well as being the setting for The Wizard of Oz, this Midwest gem packs in Wild West history, delicious produce and a flourishing arts scene.      Kansas is an agricultural powerhouse, with vast areas of land given to grain, beef cattle and buffalo. You can experience a taste (literally) of the state’s agricultural pedigree by slurping juicy peaches, tucking into farm-to-fork dinners or testing your cowboy skills on a dude ranch.      Scenic byways lead through a surprising diversity of landscapes: the last remaining tallgrass prairies, wetlands teeming with birdlife, and mushroom-shaped hoodoos. Snooze and you’ll miss Kansas on Route 66, though – the state is home to just 21km (13 miles) of the legendary highway.      It was through Kansas that families on the Oregon and Santa Fe trails drove their wagons west in search of new homesteads, while cowboys on the Chisholm Trail drove herds of longhorns north in search of the railroads. Cow towns like Abilene and Dodge City were born, and as whites forced Native Americans westwards, fierce battles over land erupted. Later, feuds over Kansas’ maintenance of slavery gave rise to the term ‘Bleeding Kansas’. Forts, trails and monuments scattered across the state bring this history to life.      Craving some culture? Then head to Topeka, the state capital. Home to the iconic Kansas Statehouse, this gleaming copper-domed capitol offers regular tours, taking visitors up 296 steps to a balcony where phenomenal views await. But the hottest ticket in town is the North Topeka Arts District, where historic buildings have found new life as art studios, galleries and antique stores. Sadly, though, there are no yellow-brick roads.","Kansas  Attractions in Kansas  Dodge City  Step back in time in the restored cattle town of Dodge City, where lawmen Bat Masterson and Wyatt Earp earned their fame.

afghanistan,"An essential stop on the hippie trail in the 1960s, beautiful Afghanistan has been devastated by years of war. Renowned for its epic countryside and rugged mountains, travellers came to interact with local communities, breathe clear mountain air and explore ancient sites such as the giant Buddha statues of Bamiyan. They were happy times.      Sadly, those days are gone. The Taliban destroyed most of the country’s monuments, while the US and its allies ruined what was left of Afghanistan’s creaking infrastructure. With thousands of peacekeeping troops still operating in the country and pockets of fighting continuing, it will be some time before Afghanistan is restored to its former glory.      Consequently, travellers are advised against visiting Afghanistan. Nevertheless, some adventurous tour companies are offering trips to the country, and there have been reports in some quarters of increased bookings and interest. Afghan authorities put tourist numbers at less than 20,000, though they claim it is slowly increasing.      Tending to take in the historic but war-ravaged city of Kabul, mountain villages, ancient fortifications and some surviving Buddhist sites, tours are generally conducted in small groups and tend to be expensive.      Guides make the point that for many ordinary Afghans, life has continued much the same as it has for centuries. Indeed of the few travellers that do make it to the country, they tell of the surprising normality of Kabul, with little signs of the instability reported by international media. The country also remains a fascinating melting pot of ethnic and tribal groups.      Despite hopes that tourism could return to this historic country, almost every area of Afghanistan remains dangerous as insurgents continue to threaten the fragile democracy. If you do decide to travel to Afghanistan, personal security is recommended, as is a reputable tour company and full travel insurance. Always check foreign office advice before travelling.","Afghanistan  Attractions in Afghanistan  Admire the resilient capital, Kabul  Since the US invasion it is estimated that one-third of Afghanistan's public buildings and roughly 40% of its houses have been destroyed. Miraculously Kabul has survived much of the carnage and there's still plenty to admire in the ancient Afghan capital. There are beautiful parks, the ancient walls of the citadel, Bala Hissar, and several newly restored museums.  Explore the recovering Kabul Museum  Though the museum's contents have been dramatically depleted over the years, the beleaguered Kabul Museum still has a good amount of artefacts on display, including Greco-Bactrian Buddha statues, and a marble basin from Kandahar often referred to as Buddha's Begging Bowl.  Gawp at the “Red City” of Shahr-i-Zohak  Take in Shahr-i-Zahak, also known as the ""Red City"", about 17km (11 miles) from Bamiyan. Here lies one of Afghanistan's most breath-taking ancient citadels, situated atop a cliff overlooking the intersection of the Bamiyan and Kalu rivers. The mud-brick towers rise eerily from the rock face, as though natural formations.  Hike through the Valley of Paghman  If the security situation permits it, head to the rugged Valley of Paghman, which is about 90 minutes by road from the capital. Here many of Kabul's wealthiest residents once kept second houses and you can see why – the landscape is spectacular. Today, alas, the area is somewhat quiet.  Marvel at the Hindu Kush  Take some time to explore the Hindu Kush, a wild and remote region consisting of two huge mountain ranges. Although travelling by car is possible, the steepness of the routes makes vehicles prone to breakdowns. For those who make the journey, the mountains, valleys and lakes provide stunning scenery.  Scale the Bibi Mahru Hill  It was at the top of Bibi Mahru Hill that Moghul ruler Babur first looked over Kabul. This is a popular spot for walking and for the views of the lands around. There's also an Olympic-size swimming pool atop it, but problems with pumping water up hill mean that it's rarely full.  See Afghan art in the National Gallery  Displaying a range of historic artwork and more contemporary pieces, the National Gallery in Kabul has, like the Kabul Museum, seen its fair share of destruction. However, many pieces have been salvaged, and the staff offer guided tours around the exhibitions.  Take a trip to Jalalabad  If the security situation permits, visit Jalalabad, the capital of the Nangarhar Province, which used to be a pretty winter resort, before decades of war saw it become a no-go area. Today, it is awash with cypress trees and flowering shrubs.  Visit Ka Faroshi bird market  In a little street tucked behind the Pul-e Khishti Mosque in Kabul, you'll find this market selling birds of all shapes and sizes, including kowk (fighting partridge), which are made to fight on Friday mornings with bystanders betting on the winner. Some visitors may find the kowk fights disturbing, but it remains a much-loved tradition here.  Wander around Babur's Gardens (Bagh-e Babur)  This striking and historic garden in Kabul was created under the first Mughal ruler Babur in the 1500s. Inside the high walls, visitors can explore 11 hectares (27 acres) of greenery, assorted flora, a pavilion, a marble mosque and Babur's tomb, which reads the inscription: ""If there is a paradise on Earth, it is this, it is this, it is this!""  Wonder at the unique Sultani Museum  Neighbouring the National Gallery in Kabul, the Sultani Museum hosts an extraordinary collection of Afghan artefacts put together by gold trader and arts dealer Ahmad Shah Sultani, who assembled most of these items while in exile in London. His museum hosts an array of early-Islamic manuscripts, precious coins, ancient pottery, woodcarvings and much more.",asia,,
sark herm,,"Sark & Herm  Attractions in Sark & Herm  Bird watching  Birdwatchers from around the world list Sark and Herm as one of their top birding destinations. More than 200 species have been recorded, most being migratory.  Charter a boat trip  A boat ride around the islands can offer fantastic views of the coastline and make for an enjoyable day trip. There's a chance to spot dolphins as well as get a full view of cliff nesting birds.  Climb inside a cave  At low tide, it is possible to explore some of the many coastal caves. The Jewel Cave in Sark is one of the most beautiful – it's home to thousands of anemones that cling to the walls and turn the rocks every colour from yellow to mauve. Bear in mind, however, that the cave is only accessibly at low tide and caution is recommended.  Cross La Coupée  Crossing La Coupée, Sark's iconic isthmus, is a must-do activity. A heady 79m (260ft) above sea level, the crossing was certainly precarious for the island's residents before guard rails, and later, pavement were constructed. Cyclists and horse riders must still dismount.  Explore Creux Harbour  Visit Sark's original serving harbour. Cliff-cut tunnels and pretty bays make for fun exploring or a tranquil picnic stop.  Gardens of La Seigneurie  The Royal Horticultural Society ranked these gardens as among the finest in the Channel Islands. The gardens are open every day from the beginning of April to the end of October.  Go on a day trip to Brecqhou  Guests at Sark Estate Management's hotels can now take advantage of guided tours to the Barclay brothers' famous private island.  Oystercatcher's Rock  Sark's northernmost point, Bec du Nez or 'Oystercatcher's Rock', provides the viewer with a natural stage from which to take in the sea fresh surroundings.

Sark Windmill  One of the Channel Island's remaining old windmills, the Sark windmill was in use until 1917.The tower is topped with a jaunty onion shaped ogee cap.  Sark prison  Built in 1856, Sark's prison must be one of the world's smallest. Prisoners in the past didn't exactly get a 5-star treatment as it is entirely windowless. The prison is still used today – although not very often!  Sip a pint  Herm's only pub, the Mermaid Tavern, is the centre of the island's social life. Sandwiches and stomach lining meals are available, not to mention a glorious view with which to enjoy a pint to. On Sark there are three pubs as well as several cafes and restaurants.  Swimming  Swim in Sark's clean waters and discover secluded beaches. Dixcart Bay has two sandy beaches separated by a natural arch. Tidal pools are also numerous, such as the Venus Pool (a 6.1m/20ft tidal pool) and Adonis Pool; accessible at low tide. Herm Island's coastline is also a great environment for snorkeling, and, further out, diving.  Take a stroll  Few places in the world can boast zero traffic. Make the most of this safe and picturesque landscape on foot. There are scenic walks along cliffs and pathways throughout. Herm Island takes less than two hours to complete. Pop into the tourist office for maps.  Visit Tom Thumb  Herm's Tom Thumb Village has been restored from dereliction. Houses, a chapel and woods make for a lighthearted visit.",europe,channel islands,
denmark,"Consistently ranked in the top three of the world's happiest nations, Denmark is a prosperous country with strong social benefits and low income inequality ratings.      Copenhagen, the capital, is a cool, cosmopolitan city whose debonair inhabitants foster an affable atmosphere more typical of a small town than capital city. Synonymous with bold architecture and cutting-edge design, Copenhagen is also a culinary pioneer. The city's cobbled streets and windswept squares harbour some of the best restaurants in the world, most notably Noma, the brilliant brainchild of Rene Redzepi.      The pedestrianised city centre of Copenhagen is a breeze to navigate – visitors can feel the pulse of the city in the Meatpacking District, rummage around the antique shops in the multicultural Nørrebro neighbourhood, embrace communal living in Freetown Christiania, and of course there is Nyhavn, best known for its quaint harbour, colourful merchants' houses and throbbing nightlife.      But there's more to Denmark than its cool capital. Zealand, the island on which Copenhagen sits, is also home to Roskilde – once the Viking capital of Denmark. Along with a soaring UNESCO-listed cathedral, there's a museum housing some of the best-preserved Viking ships ever uncovered and a smattering of pretty cafés, shops and galleries. Since 1971, the city also hosts the annual Roskilde Festival with all proceeds going directly to humanitarian and cultural causes.      Odense on the island of Funen is also a worthy diversion. The birthplace of Hans Christian Andersen (his yellow house on a cobbled street in the centre of Odense is now a poet museum), Odense is a cultural gem where you don’t have to wrestle with throngs of tourists.      To the north, the Jutland west coast stretches for more than 500km (311 miles) from the marshlands of South Jutland to drifting sand dunes and wide sandy beaches of North Jutland. Skagen, Denmark's northernmost town on the east coast of the Skagen Odde peninsula in the far north of Jutland, is a favourite holiday destination among Danish families who come to bask on golden beaches and watch scintillating Scandinavian sunsets. Life is blissful here, it is little wonder that Denmark is one of the world’s happiest countries.","Denmark  Attractions in Denmark  Aalborg: a cultural hub  Aalborg, also spelt Ålborg, is a cultural hub in North Jutland. Top attractions include Kunsten (Museum of Modern Art Aalborg), Musikkens Hus (music hall), Utzon Center and Lindholm Høje (multiple burial sites from the Germanic Iron Age and the Viking Age). Aalborg is also the city of schnapps, although the production has moved from Aalborg to Norway in 2015, visitors can still buy schnapps and akvavit in every supermarket.  Aarhus: the second largest city in Denmark  Offering a mixture of cosmopolitan city and quaint small town charm, Aarhus calls itself the ""World's Smallest Big City"". Must-see attractions include Den Gamle By (the Old Town Museum), ARoS Aarhus Art Museum and Moesgaard Museum. Marselisborg Palace is a royal residence of the Danish Royal Family in Aarhus – its grounds and rose garden are open to the public when the monarch is not in residence. The Godsbanen centre is a highlight for those after Danish design where pottery, metal, woodwork and laser cutting workshops are available for public.  Billund: the birthplace of Lego  Billund, a town in central Denmark, is the birthplace of Lego and naturally one of the top attractions is the LEGOLAND theme park where adults and children can marvel at the detailed LEGO reconstructions of famous sights from around the world in Miniland. Just 800m (875 yards) away from LEGOLAND is the waterpark resort Lalandia, featuring an Aquadome offering many water-based activities.  Copenhagen: Denmark’s capital  Copenhagen is a popular city-break destination. Most visitors' first port of call is Nyhavn, where colourful buildings loom over the busy waterfront. Beyond it, you'll find a city teeming with fascinating cultural and culinary highlights. Popular attractions include Tivoli Gardens, Amalienborg Palace, Freetown Christiania and SMK – the National Gallery of Denmark to name but a few. Check out the Copenhagen travel guide for more information.         Esbjerg: the gateway to the Jutland Peninsula  The colossal sculpture ""Man meets the sea"" of four, 9m (30ft) high men stoically overlook the harbour of Esbjerg is likely to be high on your agenda. Located just outside of Esbjerg, the Fisheries and Maritime Museum (https://fimus.dk) is another must-see. Visitors can immerse themselves in the interesting natural and cultural history of the UNESCO protected Wadden Sea (tidal wetlands), admire colourful fish in the aquarium and take a peek at the four cute seals housed in the Sealarium. Make sure to time your trip to the museum around the seal feeding time which is daily between 1100 – 1430 hours.  Geocenter Møns Klint: keep the kids busy  Keep the kids busy by tracing Denmark's geological history at the Geocenter Møns Klint, which opened in 2007 on the island of Møn. The centre has more than 20 activities available – visitors can join the hunt for ferocious dinosaurs or learn about the Quaternary Period with its ginormous ice glaciers, to name but a few.  Odense: the birthplace of Hans Christian Andersen  Relive childhood with a visit to the birthplace of the great fairytale writer Hans Christian Andersen in Odense on the island of Funen. Andersen was born in a tiny yellow house on a cobbled street in the centre of Odense in 1805, today it is a poet museum and a great place to start a Hans Christian Andersen tour through Odense’s oldest and prettiest parts.  Roskilde: a city of kings and Vikings  Roskilde is a city of kings and Vikings - its Gothic cathedral is the final resting place of about 40 Danish monarchs, and its Viking Ship Museum features five ancient vessels rescued from the harbour. Apart from its immensely rich heritage, Roskilde also hosts an annual rock festival that features a diverse selection of music including rock, metal, hip-hop, dance, house and world music.",europe,,
trinidad and tobago,"Trinidad and Tobago: two very different islands, one mighty inviting destination.  As the home of carnival, calypso and limbo dancing, not to mention Angostura Bitters, the country specialises in worldly contributions that have always been an assault on the senses. It’s raw in places, cosmopolitan in others and has a wondrous line-up of festivals and celebrations. What’s more, it punches way above its weight in the scenery stakes too. Diving? Hiking? Beaches? Waterfalls? Nightlife? Come on in.      To talk about it as one nation, however, is accurate but misleading. Oil-rich big brother Trinidad plays home to more than 95% of the country’s population and has all the vigour this would suggest.  Port of Spain, surrounded by verdant hills, is the main city. Here, bazaars throng beneath modern skyscrapers and mosques share the skyline with cathedrals, while the whole place bounces to the beat of Carnival, one of the planet’s great parties. It takes place annually on the Monday and Tuesday before Ash Wednesday – and more than meets the hype.      Beyond the capital beckon volcanoes, a self-replenishing asphalt lake and magnificent bird reserves, meaning the island is as famed among twitchers as it is among party animals.      Tiny Tobago, meanwhile, sitting 32km (20 miles) northeast of Trinidad, moves at an altogether gentler pace. No island was more fought over in the colonial era – it changed hands some 32 times, which says something about its appeal. It’s fertile, located outside the hurricane belt and is even said to be the inspiration behind Daniel Defoe’s Robinson Crusoe. Here, too, there are world-class attractions for nature lovers – it is home to the oldest protected rainforest in the Western Hemisphere – and you’ll also find a spread of modern beach resorts. On both islands, meanwhile, the colourful jumble of different cultural influences has left T&T with a delicious, spice-led cuisine.","Trinidad and Tobago  Attractions in Trinidad and Tobago  Bathe beside beautiful beaches  Take a dip at one of Tobago's fine beaches. Each has its own flavour, from the brown pelicans at Turtle Beach to fantastic snorkelling at Man O'War Bay. Store Bay, Mount Irvine, and Bacolet Bay are also well worth a visit, and Pigeon Point should not be missed.  Be bowled over by the Cricket at Queen’s Park Oval  Catch a cricket match at the Queen's Park Oval in Port of Spain, where the best national and international matches can be seen. Here, on the ground that launched cricket legend Brian Lara, is the only time you'll see football challenged as the national sport. The enthusiasm of the crowds is as entertaining as the games themselves.  Call in at the Queen's Park Savannah  Port of Spain's largest open space, Queen's Park Savannah, is a magnificent mixture of natural and manmade beauty with attractive trees, shrubs (including the African Tulip) and The Emperor Valley Zoo. The Royal Botanical Gardens boasts over 700 species of orchid, whilst its scattering of mansions include the historic President's House.  Celebrate Carnival in Port of Spain  Celebrate Carnival, Trinidad's wildest and most magical beano. The world-renowned festivities climax at the beginning of Lent, although the run-up to Carnival starts immediately after Christmas when the Calypso tents open and the Calypsonians perform their latest compositions. January through March are usually taken up with the preparations and festivities.  Dance to Trinidad's greatest steel bands  Listen to the big steel bands bang their drums around Queen's Park Savannah, a large park in Port of Spain. Panorama, the Grand Steel Drum (pan) tournament is staged a week before Carnival. The preliminaries and local finals in Tobago are also well worth a visit.  Find adventure in the water  Take advantage of the excellent watersports facilities at the beaches along the north and east coasts of Trinidad, and all around Tobago. Speyside and Buccoo Reef, just off the southwest coast of Tobago, have some of the Caribbean's finest reefs, offer exciting scuba-diving. Trips in glass-bottomed boats are very popular, as is both deep-sea and freshwater fishing.  Find history and fine views at Fort George  Fort George, built in 1804, is, on the western side of Port of Spain, one of the nation's most important historical buildings. The most interesting feature is a signal box designed by an African prince. It yields superb vistas of the city and the mountains of northern Venezuela. High above the city, it's a good opportunity for birdwatching.  Head underground in the Aripo Caves  Trinidad has several cave systems and the most extensive sits, appropriately perhaps, beneath its highest mountain, El Cerreo de Aripo. The stalactites and stalagmites here are sublime. Speleologists will also be intrigued by the Tamana Caves, which boasts 11 species of bat, and the subterranean treasure trove of Gasparee Caves, located on Gaspar Grande.  Hike the Tobago Forest Reserve  Get active with a long hike along the excellent trails of  Tobago's Main Ridge Forest Reserve. Some of the country's best hiking can be had here. The Argyle Falls, a three-tiered cascade and one of the island's most iconic landmarks, is here, as is Flagstaff Hill, a dramatic viewpoint on the northern tip of the island.  Kayak the calm waters of Chaguaramas  Comprising the entire peninsula which juts out to the west of Port of Spain, this is one of the best places in the country, especially Williams Bay, to try your hand at kayaking. You can book a tour of the isles peppered off the coast, where you can visit a lighthouse, cave systems and a (former) leper colony.  Marvel at the vibrant Buccoo Reef  Buccoo Reef is a jaw-droppingly beautiful coral reef that stretches around the coast from the island's highest point, Pigeon Point, to the arcing Buccoo Bay. A glass-bottomed boat tour will reveal some 40 types of coral, whilst Buccoo plays host to the best cultural events in the country, including the Sunday School Street Party and even a goat race.   Pack your binoculars for Little Tobago  Head to northeastern Tobago and the colourful beach settlement of Speyside. From here you can take a trip out to Little Tobago, also known as Bird of Paradise Island, a bird sanctuary and an essential stop-off for twitchers. Those wishing to spot the Scarlet Ibis, Trinidad and Tobago's national bird, should visit the Caroni Arena Reserve on Trinidad.  Party and potter around Port of Spain  A hefty dose of colourful, cosmopolitan life makes the Trinidadian capital a must-see. The city is far more diverse than you might expect: bazaars throng beneath modern skyscrapers and mosques rub shoulders with cathedrals. Whilst the architecture incorporates everything from Victorian houses to Stollmeyer's Castle, an imitation of a Bavarian Castle. Port of Spain is also home to the country's renowned carnival.  Ride two wheels across rural Tobago  Tobago's lush, hilly interior has some fabulous biking trails, such as those in the Adventure Nature Reserve and around the Main Ridge Forest Reserve. For fans of all things two wheels, there are guided excursions to suit all ability levels with Mountain Biking Tobago.  Spend away on Frederick Street  With three malls, Port of Spain's shopping district is centred on Frederick Street. Nearby the Red House (a stately colonial building, now the seat of government), the National Museum and Art Gallery and the 19th-century Gothic Holy Trinity Cathedral offer plenty in terms of culture.  Spend time in Tobago's tiny villages  Tobago is far more isolated than larger, more cosmopolitan Trinidad, and as such dropping in on some Tobago villages is a cultural eye-opener. On the Atlantic (windward) side of the island, there are many tiny villages including Mesopotamia and Goldsborough, the town of Roxborough and several beautiful bays. On the north coast, visit the picturesque villages of Castara and Parlatuvier.  Swim in the sulphur pools of Pitch Lake  Head to Trinidad's mellow southwest region to see Pitch Lake, one of the nation's weirdest phenomena. It is the largest natural deposit of asphalt anywhere in the world and is self-replenishing to boot. You can swim here in sulphur pools if accompanied by a guide.  Try turtle-watching on Tobago  For nature lovers, turtle-watching is magical. Three types – the giant leatherback, hawksbill and green – frequent the coast. The animals are legally protected, but you can take a guided tour to see the leatherbacks come ashore on Black Rock, or the hawksbills in the northeast of the island. March to August is when their infamous mating rituals take place.  Visit Arnos Vale sugar plantation  This former sugar plantation, the country's oldest, is now a hotel. However, the disused sugar mill, complete with formidable crushing wheels made in 1857, remains in the grounds. A well-presented museum rounds off what is all in all a fascinating testimony to a major chapter of Trinidad and Tobago's history.",caribbean,,
alabama,"Known affectionately as the ‘Heart of Dixie’, Alabama thrills visitors with its fine antebellum architecture, white powdery beaches, hearty cuisine and rich sporting heritage.      History nuts also have plenty to get their teeth into, from caves used by prehistoric Native Americans to the spot where Jefferson Davis became president of the Confederate States of America. In the 1950s and 1960s, Alabama was at the heart of the American Civil Rights Movement. Dr Martin Luther King Jr first preached at the Dexter Avenue King Memorial Baptist Church in Montgomery, and you can find sites commemorating the struggle across the state.      Alabama’s landscapes are many and varied, ranging from mountains and forests to lakes and beaches. Take a road trip through sprawling farmland and plantation homes, hike the Appalachians or paddle some of the 2,600km (1,600 miles) of waterways, which meander through the state. Alternatively, head to the coast where watersports, wildlife and white sands await.      Foodies can dig into good ole Southern fare, chomping slow-cooked hunks of barbecued meat, scooping up fresh-from-the-Gulf crab, or splurging on unpretentious gourmet dining in the bright lights of Birmingham.      Alabama’s largest city is also home to the country’s oldest baseball stadium, built in 1910. Sport is huge in Alabama. Track and field star Jesse Owens was born here and the NASCA races at Talladega Superspeedway are world famous. The state also hosts the legendary Senior Bowl, an annual North vs South battle featuring the country’s top college football players.      And if you like a good knees-up, Mobile has been celebrating Mardi Gras since 1703, longer than any other US city (yes, we’re talking about you New Orleans).","Alabama  Attractions in Alabama  Adrenalin junkies  Enjoy heart-pounding action at Talladega Superspeedway (www.talladegasuperspeedway.com), site of Nascar records for speed and competition.

Rhode Island's capital city, Providence, is a sophisticated hub of stellar museums, historic architecture, sizzling dining and buzzing student life (Brown University, an Ivy League college, is based here). Come in the summer and you can also enjoy stunning pyrotechnic shows, which illuminate the city’s waterways and feature a flotilla of performers.      Pedalling around Rhode Island is a cinch, thanks to a terrific 160km (100-mile) bike network. You can wheel past woodlands and farmland, swamps and shoreline, historic mills and villages.      And if you’re more inclined to aquatic exploration, Rhode Island is laced with navigable waterways (or ‘blueways’). Launch your kayak and paddle the tiny coves and islands of Narragansett Bay or spy hooded warblers and red-shouldered hawks from your canoe in the Great Swamp. For ocean-bound adventure, charter a yacht in Newport, epicentre of Rhode Island’s sailing scene.      Rhode Island also caters for beach bums.

lithuania,"Lithuania is a spellbinding land of castles, lakes and forests. Though relatively few knew of its charms until recently, Lithuania's capital, Vilnius, is one of Europe's most enchanting cities, owing especially to its Baroque old town. Then there is the Baltic shore, which may not have the sun-soaked appeal of other coasts, but is idyllic and largely unspoilt. The southernmost country in the Baltics, Lithuania is also home to vast plains parted by hills and sand dunes.  Lithuanian independence came soon after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. By 1995, the transition to a full market economy had been completed. The long-running border dispute with Poland was settled with the signing of a friendship and co-operation treaty in January 1992 and negotiations with Russia led to the withdrawal of the remaining Russian troops in Lithuania in August 1993. The Russian connection remains, however, with Russians being the second largest ethnic minority in the country. The largest of the three Baltic states, Lithuania gaining EU membership in 2004, since which time the country has been thrust on to the global stage, encouraging more visitors than ever.  Most of the attraction for Lithuania lies with its natural treasures. Much of the country is verdant, with several national parks that are perfect for hikers and explorers. All around the country there are countless sprawling forests ripe for wandering, as well as numerous lakes sprinkled across the landscape.  Perhaps the country's trump card is the Baltic coastline, where beguiling wetlands brim with wildlife, most notably the thousands of bird species. There's also the Curonian Spit, a stunning 100km strip of land that separates the Curonian Lagoon from the Baltic Sea, which is covered in white sands.","Lithuania  Attractions in Lithuania  Curonian Spit National Park  Hike in the Curonian Spit National Park (another UNESCO World Heritage site) (www.nerija.lt), on the peninsula separating the Curonian Lagoon from the Baltic Sea, where visitors can explore a range of large sand dunes and several pine forests.

kyrgyzstan,"Often referred to as the “Switzerland of Central Asia”, Kyrgyzstan certainly lives up to this moniker with its soaring mountain ranges, glistening glaciers and vertiginous pine forests. If it feels like you’re on top of the world, that’s because you’re not far off.      Despite its ubiquitous natural beauty and considerable size, few people can point to this landlocked nation on the map let alone pronounce its name (it’s Kur-gi-stan, by the way). Even fewer actually visit.      This is due largely to Kyrgyzstan’s geographical isolation, but also because it has been out in the cold politically – since gaining independence from the USSR, the country has remained well under the influence of neighbouring Russia.      Visitor numbers are increasing, but a short tourist season, an underdeveloped infrastructure and poor air links remain obstacles for all but the intrepid traveller. However, those who do make it here are guaranteed an experience they won’t have to share with the crowds.      Although mountains dominate, Kyrgyzstan’s landscapes are surprisingly varied: snow-capped peaks eventually give way to open plains and shimmering lakes. It really does look Switzerland in places, but elsewhere the countryside can conjure up images of Scotland, Kashmir and even the Middle East. The mountain vistas alone are reason enough to visit and no trip to Kyrgyzstan would be complete without trekking up at least one of its impressive summits.      For less active visitors there are a handful of beaches to speak of and, in the small window that passes as summer, holidaymakers can be found bathing on the shores of lakes such as Issyk Kul. Located in the Tian Shan mountains, this is a summer resort for the brave – the water here is bracing to say the least.      It’s not all about the landscapes, though. In fact a big draw for tourists is the prospect of staying with the country’s semi-nomadic shepherds, who live in yurts and eke out traditional lives in this harsh, unforgiving and unremittingly beautiful country.","Kyrgyzstan  Attractions in Kyrgyzstan  Absorb Arslanbob's natural beauty  The walnut forests surrounding the ethnic Uzbek village of Arslanbob in the Jalal-Abad province are among the largest in the world and central to the local economy. The landscape here is exceptionally beautiful and perfect for summer hiking, skiing in winter or simply walking. Stop for a drink in the main square and watch the locals play chess.  Bag a bargain at Osh market  The chaotic swell of people that duck and weave around Osh market make it one of Kyrgyzstan's main attractions. It's one of the largest in Central Asia and an excellent place to people watch or buy souvenirs, fruits, spices and everything else under the sun.  Dare to climb Central Tien Shan  Central Tien-Shan, in the far east of the country, is for the truly intrepid as it contains the nation's two highest peaks. Access is usually by helicopter and offers challenging mountaineering and glacier walks. For experienced climbers only, a trek in Tien Shan will reward with a disappearing lake and supposed UFO landing site. Mountaineering and border permits are required.  Explore the spectacular Ala-Archa Canyon  South of Bishkek, and within easy reach of the capital for day trips, this rugged valley of alpine meadows, pine forest, towering mountain peaks and fast-flowing streams offers superb scenery within the confines of a national park. Whether you want to hike, rock climb or ski, do so surrounded by natural beauty.  Get pampered at Jeti-Ögüz Sanatorium  One of Issyk-Kul's last remaining spas, the Jeti-Ögüz sanatorium offers its guests Kyrgyz-style pampering. Aside from the massages, pools, and surrounding red rock formations, it's worth a visit just to wander around the eerie building that could be lifted straight from a David Lynch film.  Hike to Tash Rabat  This isolated monument is probably Kyrgyzstan's most remarkable Silk Road site. Half-buried on a hillside some 3,500m up (11,483ft), this former caravanserai was built in the 15th century on the site of what may have been a Nestorian Christian monastery. As well as being an attraction in itself, Tash Rabat is a great starting point for hiking.  Horse ride to Lake Song-kol  The beautiful 3,000m-high (9,840ft) Song-Kol is the jewel in the crown of Kyrgyzstan's gorgeous mountain scenery. Visit in the summer when horse treks to the lake can be arranged from Kochkor and a stay in a yurt to complete the experience. Community Based Tourism can help arrange horse treks to Song-Kol.  Marvel at the Manas Ordu Complex  Close to the town of Talas is a large memorial complex dedicated to Manas, the legendary 10th-century Kyrgyz hero. Although it is unclear whether or not Manas is actually buried here, there is a mausoleum here that is a place of great reverence to most Kyrgyz.  Seek out Solomon’s Mount for picturesque panoramas  The city of Osh in the south of the country has a central rocky outcrop known locally as Solomon's Throne because the legendary king was once supposed to have slept here. The top is marked with a small shrine called Babur's House, an important pilgrimage site for Uzbeks.  Seek out the striking Burana Tower  South of Tokmok, though close enough to Bishkek for a day excursion, this tower is actually a minaret – all that remains of the 10th-century Karakhanid city of Balasagun. As well as the tower and visitor centre the site also has an interesting array of balbals, Turkic stone grave markers.  Stroll the boulevards of Bishkek  The Kyrgyzstan capital is a relaxed city with wide boulevards, leafy parks and clear views of the snow-capped Ala-Too mountain range to the south. Although specific sights are limited, the city is a pleasant place to wander, with good hotels and restaurants and interesting museums like the State Historical Museum.  Swim in Lake Issyk-Kul  Relax on Cholpon-Ata beach after a swim in Lake Issyk-Kul, the second highest alpine lake in the world.  Meaning ""warm lake"" in Kyrgyz (it is said never to freeze over), Lake Issyk-Kul is popular come summer and the nearby valleys make for enjoyable walking. Once you've dried off, head for a spot of karaoke on the town's main street.  Take a camera and capture the colours of Sary-Chelek  The Sary-Chelek Biosphere Reserve has the best environmental elements of Kyrgyzstan in one place, with a series of forests, meadows and lakes. Central to this large biosphere reserve, which is home to more than 1,000 species of plants and 160 species of bird, is the beautiful cobalt-blue lake of Sary-Chelek. Visit in autumn when the leaves turn yellow.  Trek the Altyn Arashan Valley  A number of treks start in Karakol, the major town near Lake Issyk-Kul. The most popular is the three-day hike around the Altyn Arashan Valley. The path is easy to follow and can be done without a guide, and although day two is hard going, the views from the highest point of the trek make the effort worthwhile.   Uncover Uzbek petroglyphs  There are petroglyphs all over Kyrgyzstan but some of the most accessible can be seen close to Cholpon-Ata, near Lake Issyk-Kul. Alternatively, visit the Saimaluu-Tash collection, where there are thousands of prehistoric rock carvings spread across two glacial marines. It was a sacred site as early as 2000BC and is still revered by people of the Tien Shan today.  Watch eagle hunting at Bokonbaevo  Hunting with eagles is an ancient Kyrgyz tradition that is in danger of dying out. The small town of Bokonbaevo on Lake Issyk-Kul's southern shore is one of the best places to see this in action and demonstrations can be arranged with the local CBT (Community Based Tourism) coordinator.",asia,,
north dakota,"Badlands and bison, offbeat cities and spectacular scenery, Old West tales and Native American heritage: North Dakota inspires adventure.      Humongous elk, furry bison, wild horses, poisonous rattlesnakes and packs of coyotes are among the assorted inhabitants of the state’s crown jewel, Theodore Roosevelt National Park. This remarkable badlands landscape is made up of three distinct areas, accessible by scenic roads, but more fun to discover on foot, horseback or canoe. You can encounter petrified forests, wind-carved canyons and prairie dog towns, or float through remote wilderness on the Little Missouri River.      The adventures don’t stop there. Lake Sakakawea is ripe for messing about on boats, while Devils Lake is one of the finest spots to hook walleye, northern pike and crappie. Bumping over badlands and prairies, the 225km (140mile) Maah Daah Hey Trail is a mountain biker’s paradise. And if you’re looking for hardcore action, there’s the so-called ENDracing phenomenon, a series of endurance tests ranging from a winter triathlon to a 58km (36mile) river swim.      North Dakota may not be the first place you think of when it comes to teeing off, but it claims more golf courses per capita than any other state (not such an impressive record given its sparse population). You can follow in the footsteps of 19th century explorers Lewis and Clark on a golf trail named in their honour, although whether the two pioneers bothered to pack their clubs is questionable.      Grab an urban hit in Fargo, home to the terrific Plains Art Museum, or discover dinosaurs, a homestead shack and a 1950s soda shop at the North Dakota Heritage Center in Bismarck.","North Dakota  Attractions in North Dakota  Cattle ranch  Stay on a working cattle ranch on the Knife River and enjoy horseback riding, fishing, canoeing or birdwatching.  Fargo-Moorhead  Visit the metropolitan area of Fargo-Moorhead, a prime tourist destination, with museums, amusement parks, historical buildings and annual festivals. See the locally hand-built 23m (76ft) replica of a Viking ship that made an epic journey to Norway in 1982.  Fort Abraham Lincoln  Visit Fort Abraham Lincoln (www.ndparks.com), south of Mandan, the final command post of Lt Colonel George Custer, before his famous massacre by the Sioux Indians at the Battle of Little Bighorn. Custer's entire command of 265 men was wiped out in a 20-minute battle led by Sitting Bull, Gall and Crazy Horse.  Knife River Indian Villages  Explore the traditions of Northern Plains Indians at Knife River Indian Villages (www.nps.gov/knri). Remains of earthlodge dwellings tell the silent story of a culture that was still vibrant when Lewis and Clark headed westwards on their explorations.  Theodore Roosevelt National Park  Enjoy the spectacular views of 28,329-hectare (70,000-acre) Theodore Roosevelt National Park (www.nps.gov/thro), set in the Badlands of western North Dakota. Theodore Roosevelt bought Elkorn Ranch after his wife and mother died, and found inspiration among the quiet canyons of 'rough-rider country'.",north america,united states of america,
singapore,"Once routinely criticised for being dull, Singapore has reinvented itself as one of Southeast Asia’s most modern and dynamic cities. Melding together a mass of different cultures, cuisines and architectural styles, the city-state is now studded with vast new showpiece constructions to complement its colonial-era hotels and civic buildings. Cutting-edge tourist developments continue to spring up. Shopping avenues and underground malls throb with life, as do the food courts, the riverside bars and the temple-dotted outlying neighbourhoods. It’s never going to be Bangkok, but it’s doing a fantastic job of being Singapore.      Chinese, Indian, Malay and European influences all flow through daily life here. Boring? Hardly. It’s true to say, however, that the former British trading post and colony still has a reputation for its cleanliness (it’s still panned for its seemingly petty regulations, such as the banning of chewing gum). Likewise, levels of serious crime are very low. It’s worth pointing out, too, that Singapore’s cultural mix has left it with a genuinely world-class food scene – and you won’t need to spend big to eat well.      Recent years have seen the city really pushing for recognition as an international tourist destination in its own right, rather than as a convenient stopover. Significant investment has resulted in developments such as Marina Bay Sands, the three-towered skyscraper that now stands as Singapore’s centrepiece; Resorts World Sentosa, which is home to a Universal Studios theme park; and Gardens by the Bay, a remarkable project complete with “supertrees” and two colossal plant domes.      More traditional attractions include the designer malls of Orchard Road, the exotic clatter of Chinatown and Little India and the elegance of Raffles Hotel, still standing proud more than 125 years after being built. On the subject of hotels, Singapore now offers one of the best spreads of high-end accommodation in the region: a sign, amongst other things, of its ambition to keep visitors flooding in. It’s likely to succeed.","Singapore  Attractions in Singapore  Baba House  Find out about the Peranakan community, which grew from the marriages of Chinese traders to local women. The lovingly-restored home (www.nus.edu.sg/cfa/museum/about.php), set up to look much as it did in the 1920s, can be visited only on a free tour – check the website for days and time.  Changi Museum and Chapel  Remember the dark days of Japanese wartime occupation at the Changi Museum and Chapel (www.changimuseum.com), a symbolic replica of similar chapels built by prisoners during WWII.  Chinatown Heritage Centre  Learn about the history of the Chinese community in Singapore, at this fascinating museum (www.chinatownheritagecentre.sg) set within a converted shophouse. Highlights include recorded interviews with elderly residents, and reconstructions of the cramped conditions within which many people lived.  Club Street and Ann Siang Hill  Hang out with the locals in this trendy part of Chinatown, which forms a smart playground for advertising and banking types. Numerous bars and restaurants are housed in the narrow and historic streets.  Explore temples  Experience a world of religions at Buddhist and Hindu temples, mosques and Anglican and Catholic cathedrals, which are all likely to be encountered during a comparatively brief walk around central Singapore; such is its splendid diversity.  Fort Canning Park  Escape from the hot city streets and view what was once an ancient fort of the Malay kings, covering 2.8 hectares (7 acres): Fort Canning Park, on Fort Canning Rise. The colonial ruins of the British citadel can still be viewed, as can a 19th-century Christian cemetery.  Hire a canoe  Take to the water and canoe around the island - there are a number of operators hiring out canoes at Changi point, East Coast and Sentosa Island.  Istana  Give yourself a chance to bump into the President. Open to the public just five times yearly, the Istana (www.istana.gov.sg) is the impressive official residence of the Singaporean ruler. The white neoclassical building dates back to 1869, and the extensive grounds include a nine-hole golf course.  Johore Battery  See a replica of one of three 'monster guns' which once defended Singapore. Installed by the British in 1939, they fired shells with a diameter of 15 inches (38cm) which could reach a distance of 20 miles. Today you can visit the labyrinth of tunnels at the gun emplacement site, which were used to store ammunition. The original guns were destroyed by the British before Singapore fell to the Japanese army.  Jurong Bird Park  Come face to face with birdlife at the Jurong Bird Park (www.birdpark.com.sg) on Jurong Hill, home to South East Asia's largest collection of birds. There is also the world's largest walk-in aviary, a nocturnal house and several spectacular bird shows including one demonstrating falconry. The park is popular with families.  Lau Pa Sat  Tickle your tastebuds at Lau Pa Sat (www.laupasat.biz), the largest surviving Victorian filigree cast-iron structure in South East Asia. Built in Scotland and shipped to Singapore in 1894 to act as a wet market, the structure has been restored and is now a popular food centre.  Marina Bay and the Gardens by the Bay  One of the newest land reclamation projects in Singapore, Marina Bay (www.marina-bay.sg) includes one of the city’s two huge casinos – the Sands – but also an array of bars, restaurants and events spaces. Just across the river are the Gardens by the Bay (www.gardensbythebay.com.sg), which opened in 2012 and have a combination of open-air gardens, conservatories and an aerial walkway.  National Museum of Singapore  Relive the island's past at the refurbished National Museum of Singapore (www.nationalmuseum.sg), which offers much more than just static collections telling the island state's colourful history, it is also a focal point for numerous festivals and events.  National Orchid Garden  Explore the National Orchid Garden in Singapore's Botanic Gardens (www.sbg.org.sg), which has the largest collection of orchids in the world. The Botanic Gardens have over 52 hectares (128 acres) of landscaped parkland and primary jungle. There are guided tours of the gardens on Saturdays (times vary).  Night Safari  Enter the fascinating world of nocturnal wildlife at the Night Safari (www.nightsafari.com.sg), one of Singapore’s most popular attractions and a little over an hour by bus from the city centre. Regular performances complement the park's extensive collections of animals; the world-class Singapore Zoo is next door and operated by the same company.  Parliament House  Relive colonial days near the Singapore  River, and wander towards the imposing Parliament House (www.parliament.gov.sg), the oldest government building in the country - the core dates back to the 1820s. Proceedings are open to the public when parliament is sitting, and tours are also offered.  Raffles Hotel  Prop up the bar at the Raffles Hotel (www.raffles.com/singapore), one of the most famous hotels in the world. A Singapore Sling (a head-spinningly good, if expensive, cocktail) in the Long Bar is almost de rigueur, although it’s more pleasant to take a table in the shade outside. A dress code applies indoors, so avoid wearing shorts and sandals.  Sentosa Island  Take the short trip across to Sentosa Island (www.sentosa.com.sg), with its many and varied attractions ranging from the Universal Studios theme park to an aquarium, a cable car ride, the Tiger Sky Tower, nature trails and plenty of bars and restaurants. It's a great family day out, but be warned that the various entry fees can add up to an expensive day out.  Singapore Flyer  Enjoy panoramic views over Singapore island and beyond from the 165m (540ft) tall Singapore Flyer (www.singaporeflyer.com.sg), the world's second highest Ferris wheel after the Las Vegas High Roller. Opened in March 2008 at Marina Bay, the enormous wheel offers a magnificent perspective on the bay as well as the city beyond.  Singapore River  Take a trip along Singapore River aboard a bumboat. These were once used to ferry goods to and from larger ships moored in the harbour, and nowadays offer an excellent way to see the contrasting historical and modern architectural styles of the city. Departure points include Boat Quay, Raffles Landing and Boat Quay.

oman,"Camel treks, desert camping and 4-wheel drive safaris through mighty canyons are just some of the adventures awaiting visitors to Oman. From frankincense plantations and atmospheric souks that speak of vanished centuries to gleaming modern cities and 5-star hotels fronting on to perfect beaches, Oman is everything you would want from Arabia.      What marks this desert kingdom out from its neighbours is a complex history of interaction with the outside world. From the ports of Muscat and Salahat, Omani traders roamed across the Arabian Sea, pushing back the borders of the Portuguese empire in Africa and founding trading outposts as far afield as Zanzibar and Mozambique, before aligning with the British after the abolition of slavery.      The result, thirteen centuries later, is an outwardly conservative, but strikingly open Islamic society, with a firm belief in the importance of its own traditions but a strong acceptance of other cultures. Many regard Oman as the most welcoming of all the Arabic nations; this is a place where foreigners are invited to sit and sip tea and eat dates out of genuine hospitality, rather than as a preamble to selling souvenirs.      The ruling sultans have taken great pains to preserve the traditional crafts and customs of their ancient civilisation, and the cities of Oman feel much more historic and lived-in than the skyscraper cities appearing elsewhere in the Gulf. The borders of Oman are guarded by a staggering 2,000 desert fortresses, most meticulously restored. It’s easy here to feel transported back to the days of Arabian Nights.      Along the coastline, enigmatic dhows still sail from port to port, while rugged wadis (river valleys) snake into the interior, studded with date-palm plantations, dramatic rock formations and hidden pools. Beyond, immaculately tarmacked highways cross the desert to neighbouring Yemen, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates, though many chose to fly to avoid endless drives through barren desert scenery.      More than anything though, Oman is a place to feel safe and at ease. The Omanis are gracious hosts, and visitors will find traditional Arabian hospitality and Islamic culture at its very best.","Oman  Attractions in Oman  Admire the grandeur of the Grand Mosque  Encrusted in gold, crystals and Italian white marble, Muscat's Grand Mosque is dominated by a 10-tonne crystal chandelier, which is lit by no fewer than 1,122 bulbs, and a 21-tonne carpet woven in one piece by 600 Iranian women. It took six years to build the mosque, whose huge gold dome and tall minarets dominate the skyline.  Climb the battlements of a desert fort  Oman's long military history comes alive in its desert forts, built to fend off rival sultanates and colonial empires. Muscat's Al Jalali Fort was founded by the Portuguese, while the Nakhal Fort predates even the arrival of Islam in Oman. Nizwa Fort is perhaps the most famous fortification, built in classic Arabian style in the 1650s.  Cool off in a wadi  The wadis (seasonal stream beds) of Oman are islands of green in the desert landscape, and the most popular escape from the dust and heat of the cities. Wadi Shab near Sur rises to scenic waterfalls and there are dozens of other wadis, dotted with palms and pools. Then there are the jabals, Oman's rugged mountains, famous for their dates and pomegranates.  Dive into the Arabian Sea  Oman is a stunning destination for watersports, with teeming coral reefs and rich waters for deep-sea fishing further offshore. Elsewhere, you can windsurf, sail, or ride jet skis and speedboats to remote hidden coves. Tour operators in Muscat and Salalah run bespoke trips, or you can organise your own fun in the sun off the desert island of Masirah.  Drift on a traditional dhow  At Khasab, the capital town of the Musandam Peninsula, traditional dhows have been used by fishing families for centuries. These iconic Omani boats still ply the waters near Khasab, and some are used for dolphin-spotting tours in the azure waters of the bay. The Musandam Peninsula is often described as the Norway of Arabia because of its beautiful khors (fjords).  Drop into Barka fish market  About 80km (50 miles) from Muscat, the coastal town of Barka is famous for its lively fish market. It's fascinating to watch locals bidding for fish of all colours, shapes and sizes on the bidding floor, while fishermen land the night's catches on the huge beach outside, running up the sand with filled crates and fish threaded on lines.  Explore mosques, museums and markets in Muscat  The capital of Oman is squeezed between the mountains and the sea, with tall minarets rising above its rooftops. Dotted in between the imposing mosques are fascinating museums, royal palaces and markets, or you can always just wander along the Corniche, enjoying the sea breezes, and take in the views from the Al Jalali and Al Mirani forts.  Find the vision of Arabian Nights in Nizwa  This atmospheric town is renowned for its early-morning livestock market, winding alleyways and silver handicrafts. Nizwa was the country's capital during the 6th and 7th centuries, but the iconic fort that rises above the rooftops dates from the 17th century, a time of warring tribes and insecurity. The towers and battlements have been impressively restored.  Gaze at the colours of the Bimmah Sinkhole  This enormous sinkhole is mesmerising, with its wonderful sandstone arch rising over a pool of luminous turquoise water (a result of salt and fresh water mixing together). It's worth the long climb down (and back up again) to dip your toes in the water and to get a closer view of the 40m-wide (130ft) basin.  Haggle at Muttrah Souk  This small but labyrinthine souk in Muscat is the place to haggle for gold, silver and other trinkets you thought you could never afford. It's an atmospheric spot and a good place to pick up frankincense and spices at bargain prices. The good news is that the vendors are not too persistent here.  Have a beach picnic  Locals and expats from across the Gulf love to spend the weekends with a picnic and the company of friends on the sultanates's beautiful beaches. Resorts such as Ras al Hadd offer acres of white sand, where rare sea turtles come to nest each summer, and there are more fine strips of sand at Al Mughsayl, Khalouf, and Tiwi.  Look out from the walls of Al Rustaq Fort  A vision of desert beauty, the mighty walls of Al Rustaq Fort rise out of a sea of date palms. The complex has been beautifully restored; as you wander the maze of corridors, stairways, and state rooms, remember that this was the former home of Nasir bin Murshid, the Omani king who drove the Portuguese from their castles.  Meet a genie at Bahla Fort  This is the most impressive fort in a country studded with medieval fortifications. One of Oman's many World Heritage Sites, the fortress was founded in the 13th century, and many areas have been beautifully restored, while other parts lie in picturesque ruins. Before you leave, buy a souvenir pot from local Bahla potters but don't rub it – Bahla is famous for genies!  Ride a camel across the dunes  It's hard to imagine a more Arabian experience than riding a camel across Sharqiya Sands in the Empty Quarter. On a camel safari, you'll spend the days rolling across the sands, then make camp as dusk falls, for a barbecue of mutton kebabs and a night under the most amazing starry sky.  Roll into the Empty Quarter  The largest desert in the Arabian Peninsula, the Rub' al-Khali, or Empty Quarter, rolls north from Salalah across the peninsula towards Saudi Arabia. Few people have ever crossed the desert from side to side, but you can enter the fringes on exhilarating off-road trips, exploring dramatic dunes that are the living image of Arabia.  Seek eagles in Al-Ansab  The Al-Ansab wetland near Muscat is a winter roost for migrating eagles, as well as 280 other species of birds. The Omanis have used trained birds of prey for hunting for centuries. To see flamingos, spoonbills and flocks of wading birds head to Barr Al-Hickman, one of Oman's 16 national nature reserves.  Take in the views from Jabal Shams  The ascent of 3,028m (9,934ft) Jebel Shams (Mountain of the Sun), either on foot or by 4-wheel drive jeep, offers stunning views over the shadows of Wadi Ghul, the Grand Canyon of Arabia. Dotted around the mountains are traditional villages where you can pause to haggle for goat-hair carpets from wandering weavers.  Wadi Sahtan  The beautiful ravine of Wadi Sahtan in the Rustaq region is a favourite destination for 4-wheel drive guided jeep tours. En route, you'll pass ancient villages, beautiful green pools, 14 million date palms, and craggy cliffs, stopping off for a picnic lunch beneath the towering peaks. Plus, you'll get to drive through surging streams along the way.  Watch a blowhole blow its top  The Al Mughsayl blowholes near Salalah put on an amazing natural water display during the monsoon, when sea levels rise and currents become more active. Water surges though submerged channels, forcing a gushing geyser of water high into the air. It's quite a spectacle, and nearby Al Mughsayl Bay Beach is rather spectacular too.  Watch nesting sea turtles  Turtles have been nesting on the beaches of Oman since prehistoric times, and the nesting season from July to October is the prime time to see them. At beaches such as Ras Al Jinz and Ras Al Hadd, you can see the awesome spectacle of females hauling themselves up the beach at night to lay their eggs, before slipping back to the sea.  Watch water surge down Wadi Darbat  Beautiful Wadi Darbat in the heart of Oman's southern, subtropical region of Dhofar, is famed for its natural mud baths, but it's just as interesting to stroll along the wadi, particularly in autumn, when water from the mountains forms magnificent waterfalls which cascade from a height of 100m (330ft).",middle east,,
northern territory,"Proud of its muscular individuality, ""the Territory"" is where preconceptions of Australia's tough, time-carved wilderness find their fullest shape. From the ancient green plains of the so-called Top End (the northernmost section of the Australian continent) to the natural wonders of the Red Centre, it's a region that deals in physical extremes. Travel here gives a far more untamed feel to the country than a trip along Australia's East Coast, and its relative remoteness is a big part of the appeal.      That is not to say the Northern Territory is without its home comforts, of course. Capital city Darwin is a laid-back tropical city with an upbeat bar scene, some eye-catching new developments and a thick multicultural flavour. Hang out at beach markets, take a sunset cruise or delve into the city's remarkable history – more wartime bombs fell here than at Pearl Harbor. Famously, the city is also the gateway to the phenomenal Kakadu National Park, a vast swathe of land with a powerful indigenous heritage and wildlife ranging from crocodiles to sea eagles.      Heading south along the Stuart Highway – which runs the length of the state – obvious stop-offs include the likes of Litchfield National Park, known for its waterfalls and swimming holes; Nitmiluk Gorge, one of Australia's most dramatic kayaking spots; Alice Springs, a bold and fascinating city in the middle of the country; and of course the mighty rock formations of the Red Centre, most notably the genuinely breathtaking enormity of Uluru.      Across the Northern Territory, much of the landscape is draped in Dreamtime legend, so you'll also find numerous opportunities for bushwalking, ""bush tucker"" tasting or simply learning more about Aboriginal culture.","Northern Territory  Attractions in Northern Territory  Alice Springs: Experience desert life  There is nowhere quite like Alice Springs, largely because of its back-of-beyond desert location. Affectionately called ""the Alice"" or simply ""Alice"", it has about 25,000 residents and is a great base for exploring the nearby natural wonders such as West MacDonnell Ranges (9km or 6 miles), Devils Marbles (412km or 256 miles), Uluru (468km or 291 miles) and Kings Canyon (473km or 294 miles).  Arnhem Land: Australia's last true wilderness  East of Kakadu lies the near-pristine expanse of Arnhem Land, a permit-only area that remains in Aboriginal hands. Various operators offer tours into the region, ranging from one-day excursions to multi-day fishing trips. This is truly a special and spectacular part of the country.  Daly Waters: Check out the famous pub  Have an ice-cold beer at the quirky Daly Waters Pub, a historical pub at the intersection of the Carpentaria Highway and the Stuart Highway. Built in 1893, it is one of the oldest buildings in the Northern Territory. The bar is decorated with memorabilia and banknotes left by past clientele.  Darwin: The capital of the Northern Territory  Take in the tropical, multicultural charms of Darwin. The city has transformed from a laid-back frontier town to become a sophisticated city made up of people from 70 different ethnic backgrounds. Worthy diversions include Mindil Beach, Crocodylus Park, Crocosaurus Cove and Deckchair cinema, to name but a few.  Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu) Conservation Reserve  The long drive down along the Stuart Highway holds a number of worthwhile detours, including the so-called Devils Marbles, impressively vast boulders strewn across a barren landscape, some are precariously balanced atop one another. Accounts of local Aboriginal people believing the boulders to be eggs of the mythical Rainbow Serpent are incorrect. In reality, a number of Aboriginal Dreaming stories have Karlu Karlu as their setting but none of which are about serpents.  Kakadu National Park  Tumbling waterfalls cascade into crystal-clear rock pools in Kakadu National Park, Australia's largest national park. It has been listed by UNESCO for both its natural and cultural value, which neatly sums up the park's sweeping magic.  At Ubirr (Obiri Rock) and Nourlangie Rock there are galleries of Aboriginal rock paintings, many dating back over 20,000 years.      Saltwater crocodiles are common in Kakadu National Park, particularly along South Alligator River and around the scenic Yellow Water floodplain. Go on a boat cruise to spot crocodiles and birdwatch. Website: https://parksaustralia.gov.au/kakadu/.  Litchfield National Park  Expect stunning waterfalls that cascade into crystal clear pools – Florence Falls, Buley Rockhole, Tolmer Falls, Tjaynera Falls and Surprise Creek Falls are popular spots to enjoy a refreshing dip.  MacDonnell Ranges  Spreading east and west of Alice Springs are the rugged MacDonnell Ranges – split, in colloquial terms, into the East Macs and West Macs. Both hold plenty of rewards, but it is the West Macs (West MacDonnell National Park), with remarkable stand-out features such as Glen Helen Gorge and Ormiston Gorge, that warrant you to spend a good amount of time exploring.  Mataranka: A recipe for refreshment  About 107km (66 miles) south of Katherine, the thermal pool at Mataranka appeals to highway-fatigued road-trippers. Surrounded by palm forest, the clear waters have a constant temperature to soothe aching muscles, a recipe for refreshment.  Nitmiluk National Park  Made up of 13 gorges, the spectacular Nitmiluk Gorge (formerly known as Katherine Gorge) is one of Australia's great natural wonders. While most visitors take a cruise to see the first few gorges, or canoe to the fourth, sixth and ninth gorges, you can take a helicopter tour for sensational aerial views over all 13 gorges.  Tiwi Islands  Fishing, croc-spotting, crabbing and birdwatching are the biggest drawcards of Tiwi Islands, about 80km (50 miles) to the north of Darwin. Visitors will also experience the unique Aboriginal culture here. And if you are a fan of Australian rules football, you will feel right at home.  Uluru: Be awestruck at the sacred site  Little can prepare you for the scale of Uluru or Ayers Rock, a large monolith in the heart of the Northern Territory's arid ""Red Centre"". This place is hugely important to the Aboriginal culture and is sacred to the Pitjantjatjara Anangu, the Aboriginal people of the area. Note that climbing 'the Rock' is banned after 26 October 2019. The walk around its base is a fine alternative though, as you can observe how Uluru changes its colour particular at dawn and sunset.  Watarrka National Park: Kings Canyon  Often overshadowed by Uluru to the south, Kings Canyon is another epic natural formation in Australia's outback. Get up early to scale the mighty Kings Canyon to catch the spectacular sunrise across Watarrka National Park.",oceania,australia,
puerto rico,"Think palm-fringed beaches, colourful colonial buildings and a harmony of Caribbean, Hispanic and American cultures, and you’ve got Puerto Rico in a nutshell. A coconut shell, of course. Add to this swathes of tropical rainforest, warm turquoise waters and year-round sunshine and you have all the hallmarks of a perfect holiday destination.      Most visitors flock to Puerto Rico to bask on its pristine sands. From Rincón’s rip-roaring swells to the nearly deserted shores of Vieques where wild horses roam, there really is sand and surf for every type of beach bum. Puerto Rico also has three rare bioluminescent bays: glow-in-the-dark bodies of water that produce a nighttime lightshow for kayakers and boat tours.      Inland, epic landscapes and cultural attractions abound. The central mountain range is riddled with limestone caves and rugged forest trails. El Yunque National Forest, by contrast, is a lush expanse of rainforest, with waterfalls and Taino petroglyphs. The Conservation Trust of Puerto Rico's various sites offer visitors a taste of the island’s colonial history, including Hacienda Buena Vista, an old coffee plantation, and Hacienda Esperanza, an old sugar plantation.      Culturally, Puerto Rico integrates three “roots”: Taino (an indigenous group), Spanish and African. The country is in the Caribbean, but not wholly of it, influenced also by Latin America and the USA, with which it has a colonial relationship. The American influence is visible through ubiquitous US flags, shopping malls and baseball, the national sport. Historical Spanish influences are well preserved. Old  San Juan is home to two UNESCO World Heritage sites, with blue cobblestone streets and pastel-painted colonial buildings.      This blend of cultures makes for interesting music, food and festivals, as well as some quirks of daily life (the Spanish and English languages are fused resulting in some interesting names). Preserving cultural heritage is what Puerto Ricans do best, and it’s what draws visitors back again and again. That and the beaches, of course.","Puerto Rico  Attractions in Puerto Rico  Cruise La Parguera’s coral cays  Located off the southwest coast, Mata la Gata is a gorgeous but hardly-known coral cay within La Parguera Nature Reserve, and a wonderful spot for swimming and snorkelling. Get there by water taxi from La Parguera's piers, but bring your own food and water supplies, as facilities on the island are minimal.  Dive off ‘The Wall’  Puerto Rico's coral encrusted coastline provides some fantastic opportunities for divers. Its most popular diving spot, however, is La Pared (The Wall), a 35km (22 mile) coral reef located off the south western coast. Water depths range from 16m (52ft) to 457m (1,500ft), offering something for every type of diver, in particular an abundance of colourful fish in crystal clear waters.  Explore an ancient burial ground  The Tibes Indian Ceremonial Centre is an ancient site near Ponce, well worth a visit to see its remains of ball courts, as well as a cemetery. A replica of a Taino Indian village has been built here and multiple guided tours are offered daily. There is also an on-site museum with Taino artefacts.  Get starry eyed at Arecibo Observatory  Site of the largest single-aperture radio telescope in the world, this international observatory is located in northern Puerto Rico, amid the distinctive karst landscape of limestone peaks and sinkholes. You can see the 8-hectare (20-acre) dish from an observatory platform in one such sinkhole at Arecibo's visitors' centre.  Go beach hopping  Tour the island's beaches, which include some of the Caribbean's finest. Crashboat beach on the west coast appeals to photographers for its colourful boats on the shore. Other excellent beaches include palm-fringed Luquillo Beach in Fajardo; family-friendly Escambrón in San Juan; Combate Beach on the southwest coast, which is ideal for sunset-spotting; and Flamenco Beach in Culebra, named one of the world's best by Discovery Channel.  Sample the cultural wonders of the ‘Pearl of the South’  The beautiful colonial town of Ponce, on the southern side of the island, is called 'La Perla del Sur' or 'Pearl of the South', for its distinctive architectural charms. Visit the excellent Museum of Art, which contains more than 1,000 paintings and 400 sculptures, ranging from ancient classical to contemporary art. Its collection of 19th-century Pre-Raphaelite paintings is considered among the best in the Americas.  See San José Church, one of the finest in the Americas  See the second-oldest church in the Western hemisphere, founded by Dominican monks in 1532. In the heart of Old San Juan, San José church has been undergoing restoration since 2002, uncovering early murals beneath 19th-century paintings. It is considered by scholars to be one of the best examples of Spanish Gothic architecture in the Americas.  See a night-time bioluminescent display  Puerto Rico boasts three of the world's bioluminescent bays (also called phosphorescent bays): in Fajardo, the town of La Parguera, and at Mosquito Bay on Vieques. All three offer night-time tours to see this show of natural lights dancing in the water, created by illuminated dinoflagellates, tiny sea creatures.  See the island’s history in a mosaic  Puerto Rico's capitol building is a must-see for architecture and history aficionados. The majestic marble capitol sits directly in front of the Atlantic Ocean as you enter Old San Juan. Don't just take photos outside; the interior dome features a gorgeous, colourful mosaic depicting the island's history. The Puerto Rican constitution is also on display.  Swim in the only tropical rainforest in the US  Sprawling across a mountainous expanse of northeast Puerto Rico, El Yunque is the only rainforest in the US Forest Service's system. Popular walking trails include La Mina, which leads to a waterfall and natural swimming pool, with others taking in craggy outcrops and Taino petroglyphs. On a clear day, climb the look-out tower in the park for a view of mountains and ocean.  Tour San Juan’s Museums  San Juan has a handful of interesting museums, which are a welcome diversion on rainy days. There's the Casa de los Contrafuertes, which houses the African Heritage Museum; Casa del Callejón, a traditional Spanish-style home with exhibits that explore colonial architecture and Puerto Rican family life; and the San Juan Museum of Art and History, which is housed in a 19th-century building and is often used for concerts.  View the highlights over Ponce  Perched on a hill overlooking Ponce, Castillo Serrallés is the former home of rum magnate Juan Serrallés, with a museum, artworks and butterfly garden attracting some 100,00 visitors a year. Equally impressive is La Cruceta de la Vigia, a cross-shaped observatory opposite the colonial-style mansion; from the top, you can see all the way to the Caribbean Sea.  Walk the city walls of old San Juan  Most of San Juan's old city remains are enclosed by a wall built in the 16th and 17th centuries, and which you can walk around for lovely views of the city below and the Atlantic Ocean beyond. It leads, finally, to the only remaining original doors into the old city, with its blue cobblestone streets, intimate plazas, and colonial-style homes. Standing guard over it all are the colonial Spanish fortresses of El Morro and San Cristobal.",caribbean,,
arkansas,"You may not know exactly where Arkansas is, but once you find it, this state will wow you with its phenomenal scenery and hidden hotspots.      Not quite the Midwest, not quite the Deep South, Arkansas packs in rollercoaster mountains, thick forests, extensive plains, snaking lakes and meandering rivers. Outdoor adventurers can trek to remote cabins in the tree-swathed Ozark Mountains or paddle the Buffalo River by canoe, hurtling through white water and cooling off in natural swimming pools.      The mountain town of Eureka Springs is the stuff of postcards, where photogenic Victorian homes cling to hillsides and a raft of stores, cafés and art galleries line the streets to relieve you of your dollars.      For over a century, bathers have been taking rejuvenating dips in the thermal springs at Buckstaff Bath House in Hot Springs National Park. Neighbouring Superior Bathhouse is more watering hole than waterhole; it’s now a trendy brewery and distillery.      Arkansas has its share of contemporary cultural institutions too. The swanky Clinton Presidential Center overlooks the Arkansas River in Little Rock and houses a library, museum and replica of the Oval Office. The Moshe Safdie-designed Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville sits amid 50 hectares (120 acres) of leafy gardens, and comes with its own Frank Lloyd Wright house (moved lock, stock and barrel from New Jersey).      Arkansas also played a key role in the Civil Rights struggle, most famously in the case of the Little Rock Nine, a group of black students who enrolled in an all-white high school in 1957. Tour Little Rock Central High School to learn the full story – it may surprise you, just like Arkansas.","Arkansas  Attractions in Arkansas  Crater of Diamonds State Park  Other state attractions include the Crater of Diamonds State Park, where visitors can dig for diamonds (www.craterofdiamondsstatepark.com), Fort Smith National Historic Site and prehistoric American Indian mounds at Toltec Mounds Archaeological State Park (www.arkansasstateparks.com/toltecmounds).

american samoa,"American Samoa is a tropical island paradise at the heart of Polynesia. Perhaps the most beautiful part of this so-called sub-region, which is made up of hundreds of tiny islands, American Samoa consists of seven freckles of land. And glorious nuggets of land they are, complete with volcanic backdrops, tropical forests and wildlife-rich woodlands.  If you're wondering about the name, American Samoa belongs to the US, but is not a part of it. They harbour a couple of the Manu'a group of islands, too, which are volcanic in origin and dominated by high peaks.  American Samoa's volcanoes, inactive since 1911, have left an intriguing land formation, including cavernous lava tubes. The stunning uniqueness of the landscape is why American Samoa has such a reputation for being photogenic. Of course, it's the deep-blue sea and immaculate beaches that attract many visitors.  One of the most famous spots in American Samoa is Pago Pago on the main island of Tutuila. Still holding on to its roots as an old fishing town, its natural harbour is one of the most spectacular in the world. In fact, you'll find no shortage of idyllic villages in clinging on to the old ways on these islands.  Most people live in villages along the narrow coastal plains, living off the fruits of the sea, and cultivating agriculture on the plains and nearby hills. Traditional Samoan society is based on a chieftain system of hereditary rank, and is known as the Samoan way or Fa'a Samoa. Despite the inroads of modern, Western civilisation, local cultural institutions remain the strongest single influence in American Samoan life.  If hiking is your thing, you won't be disappointed, with breath-taking trails traversing the National Park of American Samoa. In fact there are many opportunities for adventure tourism here. So whether you decide to stick to the beaches or go trekking across the jagged landscapes, you'll feel as if you've landed in some forgotten paradise.","American Samoa  Attractions in American Samoa  Explore the National Park of American Samoa  Behind the unimaginative name is a park teeming with wildlife. Covering three islands and miles of ocean, this celebrated reserve protects reefs, rainforests and everything that inhabits these fragile ecosystems. Book yourself on a guided trip to the volcanoes and get up close and personal with traditional Samoan culture and local wildlife.  Find beauty in Forbidden Bay  Claimed to be one of the most beautiful in the South Pacific, Forbidden Bay is situated on the north coast, and can be reached from Fagasa on a trek or a boat trip. Its sandy shores are refreshingly uncommercial, so make sure you stock up with plenty of food, water and sun cream before you go.  Learn to dive  Dive in the Fagatele Bay National Marine Sanctuary, which was established to protect the corals reefs and marine life in the area. Diving equipment can be hired easily and a number of companies provide dive courses and cruises to the best sites in the area.  Listen to legends at Vaitogi  Tear yourself away from American Samoa's beaches and head to the rocky cliffs of Vaitogi, where one of the archipelago's most famous legends was born. We won't spoil the story of the Turtle and Shark, but local guides will be only too happy to regale you.  Make a pilgrimage to Ta'u Island  Ta'u Island is considered the birthplace of the Polynesian people and therefore recognised as a sacred site. Geographically speaking the island is ensconced in the remnants of a volcano. Thankfully the last known eruption was in 1866. From the highest point on the island you can spy Upolu in neighbouring Samoa, which is sometimes visible.  Take a cruise to neighbouring Samoa  It's relatively simple to travel by boat to Samoa and stay overnight in a local Fale (a Samoan house made from coconut palm fronds). Getting by is also a doddle, as the official languages are English and Samoan, which is also spoken in American Samoa.  Try your hand at game fishing  Go game fishing for marlin, yellowfin tuna, wahoo and skip jack. Fully-equipped fishing boats can be hired through hotels or tour operators. Perfect for beginners or more experienced anglers, the waters around American Samoa have long been cherished for its plentiful fish and crystal-clear clarity.  Visit Tula Village  Situated at the far end of the eastern district of Tutuila, Tula Village overlooks a coastline of white sandy beaches and reefs that are exposed at low tide. The area is believed to have been the first settlement on the island, with its residents travelling from Fiji and Indonesia around 600 BC.  While away the day in Pago Pago  Don't miss the harbour of Pago Pago, made famous by Somerset Maugham's short story, Rain. The town itself is a hub for semi-urban communities, tuna canneries and provides employment for a third of the population of the island of Tutuila. Interestingly, the area is actually the crater of an extinct volcano.  Work up an appetite with a fia fia  Experience the legendary Samoan feast where food and entertainment go hand in hand. Suckling pig, chicken and fish, breadfruit, coconuts and mango are served during performances of traditional dancing. The term fia fia translates into many meanings such as ""happy"", ""celebration"" or ""get-together"". Rest assured, a good time will be had.",oceania,,
el salvador,"The smallest country in Central America, El Salvador is big on natural wonders. The word is out among more intrepid travellers that this is the region’s up-and-coming destination. Newcomers are bowled over by the stunning landscape, with smoking volcanoes, surf-pounded beaches, pristine cloud forests and crystalline lagoons. And those in the know are drawn back time and again by its warm-hearted and dynamic people.      This tiny tropical land, about the size of Wales or Massachusetts, is packed with highlights. Magnificent, crowd-free national parks include Cerro Verde, Montecristo and the irresistibly named El Imposible. You can shoot the rapids on whitewater rafts, or take a lazy boat ride across volcanic crater lakes Ilopango and Coatepeque. Surfers flock to the world-class Pacific breakers at Sonsonate, El Zonte and La Unión, only a short drive from the capital. The archaeological remains at Tazumal mark the furthest outpost of the Maya empire; the Ruta de Las Flores features colourful, flower-filled villages, with volcanic hot springs and indigenous craft markets; and Morazán province offers tours of civil war trenches led by former guerrillas turned guides.      El Salvador still has a bad reputation for violent crime, but the truth is that the locals have always suffered much more than tourists at the hands of criminals, most of whom are more concerned with the feuding of rival drug gangs.      The tourism industry is responding rapidly to the country’s rising popularity. Coffee plantations are inviting guests to visit, to eat and drink, to stay, to work. Beach resorts are becoming more boutique, spa hotels are multiplying and the eastern Gulf of Fonseca is being developed, with boat-and-bus routes connecting with neighbouring Nicaragua. El Salvador may not yet be the most comfortable place to visit in the region, but for the increasing number of people who are making the effort, the rewards are plentiful.","El Salvador  Attractions in El Salvador  Canyon down El Imposible’s rushing rivers  El Imposible, the country's most important ecological reserve, is a must for the nature-hungry traveller and thrill seeker. Over 500 species of bird flit between the trees; you may even catch a glimpse of the rare black hawk eagle whilst trekking through the forest, or canyoning down the steep river gorges.  Dip into the volcanic lakes  Try your hand at fishing, sailing, waterskiing and kayaking on the volcanic crater lakes of Coatepeque and Ilopango, either side of San Salvador. And if that's not enough adventure for you, go for a dive to explore the rocky depths of Ilopango, whose waters have tepid temperatures all year.  Explore the cloud forest of Cerro Verde  Spectacular cloud forest, sweeping views, clean mountain air, exhilarating walks and three volcanoes are yours to explore in this 505 hectare (1,250 acre) national park in central El Salvador. Expert local guides lead day hikes from San Salvador, taking in Cerro Verde, Izalco and Santa Ana volcanoes looming high above the steamy jungle.  Follow the Floral Route  To the west of San Salvador lies some of the country's most luscious landscapes, which are peppered with lazy villages and linked by the scenic Ruta de las Flores. Here you can hike up volcanoes, clamber over Pre-Columbian ruins and explore peaceful indigenous villages, such as Nahuizalco, Juayua, Apaneca, Ataco and Ahuachapán.  Go butterfly spotting in Barra de Santiago  Arguably El Salvador's most pristine beach, this sandy expanse in the far west doubles as a nature reserve for butterfly and bird species. You can explore the mangroves of the Zapote estuary by boat or canoe, or just chill in a beachfront cafe. Local groups and hotels including La Cocotera eco lodge are working to re-establish endangered species like the marine turtle and red macaw.  Go horse riding up Guazapa volcano  Ecotourism is one of El Salvador's fastest growing activities, with an increasing number of specialist agencies offering multi-activity tours of its unspoilt wilderness. One of the most popular adventures is a horseback ride through beautiful scenery, covering three climate zones, to the summit of the Guazapa volcano, before returning to base to learn how to make maize tortillas.  Go white-water rafting  Whether you are new to the thrills and spills of this exciting sport or a seasoned expert, the rivers of El Salvador are classic white-water experiences. The best rafting rivers are Lempa, Guajoyo and Paz during the rainy season (May to October) and the Paz in the dry season (November to April). You can find specialist operators in San Salvador and Suchitoto.  Join in Panchimalco’s indigenous festivities  The Pancho, who give the village of Panchimalco its name, are sadly among the few remaining indigenous people in El Salvador who have retained their old traditions. The best times to visit this historic town near San Salvador are 13-14 September (Fiesta de Santa Cruz de Roma) or 3 May (Las Palmas harvest procession), colourful occasions when pagan and Christian customs merge.  Let former guerrillas lead you on the Peace Route  Peace has now been restored to the beautiful countryside around Perquín, scene of some of the bloodiest battles in El Salvador's civil war. Former guerrillas explain the history in the Museo de la Revolución Salvadoreña; you can also mix politics with pleasure by going swimming in the Rio Sapo, birdwatching in the ecological reserve, or canoeing, horse riding and rock climbing.  Ramble around Maya ruins  Before the Spanish conquest, the great Maya civilisation reached as far as El Salvador. No great pyramids have survived here but sites worth visiting include San Andres, Tazumal and Joya de Cerén, a uniquely preserved Maya settlement whose houses were buried under volcanic ash 1,400 years ago and which is now on UNESCO's World Heritage list.  See Fernando Llort’s vivid artworks  Born in 1949, Fernando Llort is El Salvador's greatest living artist. He is known for his use of bright colours and highly individual style that incorporates symbols representing life in the country of his birth. You can view Llort's work in his museum, El Arbol de Dios, in San Salvador; a collection of his murals also stands on the city's southern entrance.  Seek out the sights of San Salvador  El Salvador's capital is a traffic-clogged jumble, but worth a visit for several historic and cultural gems, such as the Palacio Nacional, the restored Teatro Nacional and the Biblioteca Nacional. The nicest church is La Ceiba de Guadalupe, with a fine wooden ceiling, and the best museum is the modern National Anthropology museum, displaying the country's history as well as putting on cultural events.  Soak up the sights of Suchitoto  By far and away El Salvador's prettiest colonial town, Suchitoto is famous for its parish church, which dominates the main square. There is a craft market here most days and it comes alive on weekend nights with a loud and lively fair. Wander around its cobbled streets lined with colonial architecture, or take a boat cruise around the nearby Lago de Suchitlán.  Stay on a coffee plantation  Coffee became El Salvador's most important export in the mid 19th century; plantations are still dotted around the countryside, some offering tours for visitors. Buy the local product when visiting Ecoparque El Espino on the slopes of the Boquerón volcano. Alternatively, book a stay at the Hotel Santa Leticia in Apaneca, a working plantation in the Ruta de las Flores.  Visit surfing heaven  El Salvador's Pacific coastline is surfing heaven, with crowd-free beaches and world-class breaks. South of San Miguel is Las Flores, from where boats head to Punta Mango and the biggest waves in the country, suitable for beginners and experts alike. Closest to the capital are El Sunzal (La Libertad), El Zonte and El Tunco beaches, dotted along the idyllic Costa del Bálsamo.  Zip through the forest canopy  For a powerful adrenalin rush, it's hard to beat the spectacular Apaneca Canopy Tour, a thrilling zip-line circuit strung 150m (492ft) above the tropical forests of western El Salvador. Enjoy a bird's-eye view of Apaneca's coffee plantations as you glide over breathtaking mountain scenery. (Not recommended for those with a fear of heights).",north america,,

peru,"South America doesn’t get much more evocative of generations gone by than Peru. Its mix of ancient civilisations and dramatic archaeology, set among some of the most extraordinary landscapes on the planet, means few destinations have as much to offer cultural visitors.      The old Inca settlement of Machu Picchu, now said to be the most visited site on the entire continent, is just the poster-child – it’s utterly magnificent, of course, but it’s just one of many highlights served up by the country. From mountain range to jungle, beach to desert, colonial town to cosmopolitan city, it’s a truly wonderful place to travel.      The coastal capital, Lima, can seem chaotic at times, but scratch the surface and you’ll unearth some great museums and nightclubs, not to mention some of the region’s best food and drink – from ceviche (raw fish in citrus) to cecina (dried pork) and from Peruvian wine (yes, really) to pisco sours.      But the country’s real appeal lies outside the capital. Contrasting beautifully with Lima is the ancient capital of Cusco with its winding cobbled streets and 1,000-plus years of history. It’s the gateway for visitors to the unmissable Machu Picchu, as well as those walking the Inca trail, but it makes for a colourful destination in its own right. There’s no better place to learn more about the country’s earlier times and the upheaval of the Spanish conquest.       Elsewhere in the country, the Nazca Lines, the beautifully excavated ruins of Chan Chan and the Chachapoya fortress of Kuelap boggle the mind. These extraordinary complexes are all set amid stunning landscapes.      But Peru doesn’t solely involve rushing up and down mountains or traipsing around ruins. If you’re searching for a relaxing beach destination, head to Máncora, which is popular with sun-seekers and surfers. A little more subdued, but no less beautiful, is the quaint coastal town of Huanchaco, where you can sit on the beach and watch fishermen ply their trade on traditional reed canoes. It’s a far cry from the lofty Andes and a testament to Peru’s staggering diversity.","Peru  Attractions in Peru  Bask in the year-round sunshine of Arequipa  This beautiful colonial city is the gateway to Colca Canyon and is renowned for its year-round sunshine. Explore the peaceful cloisters of the Monastery of Santa Catalina, where, for hundreds of years, nuns lived their entire lives; and visit the Museo Santuarios Andinos to see Juanita, a perfectly preserved mummy of a sacrificial Inca girl.  Be Awed by the adobe city of Chan Chan  You can discover more archaeological treasures, at the UNESCO-protected site of Chan Chan. Home to the ancient Chimu culture, Chan Chan was the biggest pre-Columbian city in South America. The adobe city has been excavated along with its nearby huacas (pyramid temples) of the sun and the moon. The beautifully restored Huaca Arco Iris is covered with pre-Inca hieroglyphics.  Be puzzled by the mysterious Nazca Lines  Take a flight over the ancient Nazca Lines, vast and spectacular geoglyphs etched into the desert floor 420km (265 miles) south of Lima. The most notable designs represent animals, including birds, felines and reptiles. How they were made or why remains a mystery, but the enigmatic lines date back to between 500BC and AD500.  Bone up on the history of Iglesia San Francisco  See one of the few buildings to withstand Lima's 1746 earthquake, the UNESCO-listed Iglesia San Francisco. Inside visitors can gawp at an extraordinary domed roof, a vast library and masterpieces attributed to the schools of Zurburán, Rubens and Van Dyck. Oh and did we mention the eerie catacombs, which are adorned with the bones of some 25,000 souls?  Chill in Huacachina  This palm-fringed oasis in the southern desert near Ica, surrounded by pristine sand dunes, is a place for relaxation and fun. As well as a laidback nightlife, Huachina offers dune buggying and sand boarding, and is great for either a day trip or to chill out for a few days.  Crack the mysteries of Caral  Spread across the desert to the north of Lima are the remains of the 5,000-year-old city of Caral, deemed the most ancient city in the Americas. Consisting of a complex of pyramids and sunken plazas dating back to 2500 BC, Caral was discovered in 1994 and has opened to visitors following years of excavation.  Cruise sky-high Lake Titicaca  Take a cruise on Lake Titicaca, the highest commercially navigable lake in the world, straddling the Bolivia-Peru border. Covering 8,379sq km (3,235sq miles), Lake Titicaca is surrounded by ancient ruins and is home to several small island communities, including the Uros islands, made from reeds.  Discover Lima's colonial centre  Trawl through five centuries of colonial history in the Peruvian capital, admiring its handsome plazas and opulent mansions with Moorish-style latticed wooden balconies. The main square, Plaza de Armas, is home to the impressive 18th-century cathedral and the lavish Government Palace. The centre has been spruced up and the paved Jirón de la Unión is lined with lively street cafes.  Explore Cusco, ‘Navel of the Universe’  Don't miss a trip to the capital of the Inca Empire, Cusco. This World Heritage Site, founded in AD1100, is a fascinating mix of Inca temples and colonial Spanish palaces and churches. Narrow cobblestone alleyways are flanked with original Inca stonework, beautifully constructed by hand to withstand centuries of volcanic activity.  Gaze in awe at mountaintop Machu Picchu  Whether it's your reward at the end of the Inca Trail, or via a comfy train ride through the Andes, you cannot fail to be overawed by Peru's top attraction: the Inca city of Machu Picchu, perched atop a remote mountain northwest of Cusco. This World Heritage Site, rediscovered in 1911, is arguably the most important archaeological site in South America, and the most dramatically located.  Get drenched at Carnival  Go to Cajamarca's Carnival, which is famous throughout Peru for its annual celebrations that last for an entire month. One word of warning – the traditional Cajamarca Carnival greeting is to be soaked with water so look out for cheeky children flinging water balloons. Other special attractions include ancient Inca remains, hot springs and weird rock formations in the surrounding mountains.  Greet the Sun God at Sacsayhuamán  If you're looking for impressive Inca ruins, the massive stone fortress of Sacsayhuamán is a great place to explore. Overlooking the city, this is the most impressive of Cusco's four neighbouring Inca sites (the others are Puca Pucara, Qenko and Tambo Machay). On 24 June, thousands gather here to celebrate Inti Raymi, a festival for the Inca sun god.  Haggle for handicrafts in Ayacucho  Apart from its famous 33 colonial churches, the Andean city of Ayacucho is also well known for its handicrafts. You can browse here for traditional crafts such as pottery, leatherwork, textiles and jewellery. Other places to scout for high-quality souvenirs include Cajamarca, in northern Peru, or the colourful daily market in Lima's Chinatown district.  Hike the Inca Trail  Puff your way around one of the world's most famous mountain treks, the (literally) breath-taking Inca Trail to Machu Picchu, the mountaintop city. This ancient trail passes snow-capped mountains, cloud forest and a string of Inca ceremonial centres, including Phuyupatamarca and Wiñay Wayna. Only recognised tour operators can purchase permits to the Inca Trail, with 500 available per day.  Hit the hiking trails  From the mountain-based city of Huaraz, you can head off on world-famous hiking routes. You can also get stuck into some extreme sports such as white-water rafting and ice climbing, or for those with gentler tastes, go on a nature trail to view the Puya Raimondi, the world's biggest bromeliad.  Immerse yourself in nature in Manu National Park  Peru's greatest treasure in biodiversity, Manu National Park covers 20,000sq km (7,722sq miles) of tropical rainforest. This World Natural Heritage Site in southeastern Peru is home to around 2,000 plant species, 1,200 butterfly species, 800 bird types and 200 different mammals, including monkeys, tapirs, sloth, jaguar and capybaras. Eco-tour packages available range from no-frills to boutique luxury.  Look out for condors  Overlooking the Colca Canyon, one of the deepest gorges in the Americas, is the Cruz del Condor viewpoint. From here you can spot condors majestically soaring up from the valley below on morning thermals. You can reach the canyon from Arequipa via either a tour group excursion or a long, bumpy ride on public transport through stunning Andean scenery.  Plunge into Colca Canyon  At a depth of more than 3,400m (11,333ft), the Colca Canyon is almost twice as deep as the Grand Canyon. Villages, such as Yanque and Chivay, which have hardly changed for centuries, and the many pre-Inca tombs, ruins, and hot springs in the area, are also worth visiting.  Tackle the Cordillera Blanca  The extraordinarily beautiful Cordillera Blanca trail is a 180km-long  (113 mile) paradise of snow-capped mountains, glaciers, emerald-green lakes and archaeological sites, containing a wide variety of flora and fauna. This awesome mountain range contains some of the highest peaks in the Andes, including Huascarán, at 6,768m (22,205ft), the tallest in Peru.",south america,,
jersey,"The largest of the Channel Islands, Jersey (officially the Bailiwick of Jersey) has the charms of a quaint and quiet island few people can resist. This laid-back haven promises an authentic sand-between-your-toes holiday. Beyond the beach, undulating farmlands stretch inland, dappled with wild meadows, vineyards and dreamy stargazing spots.      Holidaymakers don't come to Jersey to check sites off a bucket list. They come to cycle the quiet country lanes, spend hours on beautiful beaches, linger over delicious meals, and find the best spot to watch the sunset.      But not all visitors to Jersey stick to the more sedate pursuits. There are plenty of opportunities to surf the curls of turquoise waters (St Ouen's Bay is the perfect place to paddle out and enjoy the swells), take the kayak out to discover secluded bays, rock climb or coasteering if you wish.      This unbeatable holiday destination is also easily accessible. Lying about 23km (14 miles) from the coast of Normandy in France and 137km (85 miles) south of the English coast, Jersey is linked to various European destinations by flights and ferries. So get on board one and come here to lap up the good life.","Jersey  Attractions in Jersey  Castles  Jersey has two castles that are well worth a visit. The first is Elizabeth Castle, built on a rocky islet a mile off the coast of St Helier. Famous residents and visitors of the Castle include Sir Walter Raleigh and King Charles II. The Castle is accessible on foot at low tide or by the Castle Ferry at high or low tide.      Mont Orgueil Castle, on the eastern side of the island, has been defending Jersey throughout history, particularly from 1200 to 1600 when the French forces were keen to attack Jersey. The views from the Castle are also magnificent.  Cycling  Jersey is good to explore on two wheels. There are numerous cycle routes, as well as ""Green Lanes"" which give priority to pedestrians, cyclists and horse riders (and cars must slow to 15mph or 24kph).  Dining  Jersey may be compact but it has a long list of quality pubs and award-winning restaurants. Come to feast on seafood fresh off the boat and produce harvested from the fields. When it comes to drinks, La Mare is the only wine estate on the island, producing red, white, rose and sparkling wines, as well as spirits.  Jersey War Tunnels  In 1941, German forces came to Jersey. Wanting to fortify Jersey, they ordered some 5,000 slave labourers to dig a vast network of underground tunnels. Today, a section of the tunnels is open to the public, telling the touching story of Jersey's occupation.  Jersey Zoological Park  Founded in 1959 by Gerald Durrell, the Jersey Zoo still engages in immense conservation efforts, saving the most threatened species. The Zoo has successfully bred many rare bats and primates, and some animals residing at the Zoo are part of a breeding program that aims to release them back into the wild.  Museums  Jersey has a few outstanding museums. The Channel Island Military Museum charts the history of the five years of German occupation. The Maritime Museum is about the island's seafaring past. The Jersey Museum & Art Gallery explores the history from 250,000 years ago through to more recent events.  Swimming  Jersey isn't short of great beaches. Top swimming spots include St Brelade's Bay, Grève de Lecq, Plémont Bay and St Ouen's Bay. Havre des pas is a child-friendly lido just a few minutes from the centre of St Helier.  Walking  Wherever you are in Jersey, you're wonderfully close to nature. Recommended walking routes include St Lawrence Parish Walk (which intersects both the Hamptonne Museum and Jersey War Tunnels), St Catherine's Breakwater to Gorey Pier (with stunning views across to France), and the Windmill to Grosnez Castle Ruins to watch the sunset.",europe,channel islands,
china,"Colossal, dizzying and fiercely foreign, China isn’t easily compared to anywhere else on the planet. Home to approximately one fifth of the human race, it variously dazzles, befuddles, frustrates and thrills. The key visitor attractions are renowned around the globe – think the Great Wall, the Forbidden City, and the Terracotta Warriors – but it’s the sheer scale and off-kilter energy of the place that leave the most lasting impression.      The economic drive of recent times means many of China’s cities are as shaped by modernity as anywhere you care to mention, but it’s also somewhere underpinned by dearly held customs and a near-unfathomable amount of diversity. China's landscapes unfurl across the map in vast swathes of territory, and its sights, sounds and infinite oddities collectively amount to one of the world’s truly great travel experiences. The food’s fantastic too, and getting to grips with the different regional cuisines can be hugely enjoyable.      In other areas, tradition only counts for so much. The pace of development in its key cities – Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou and increasingly others – has thrown up skylines to rival almost any in the world. They’re emblematic of the ‘new’ China, a powerhouse both economically and politically; somewhere eager to make the rest of the world sit up and take notice. Even the ego-driven rulers of the past, from Qin Shi Huang through to Mao, would surely be amazed at just how influential their country has become.      Shift away from the urban sprawl and out into China’s rural areas, however, and you’re confronted with a very different reality. The scenery veers from lush terraced rice paddies and the harsh peaks of the Himalayas to the gorges of the UNESCO-protected Yangtze River. In some of the rural heartlands, indeed, the tableau of life can seem little changed from 50 years ago, at least on the surface. China is full of endless quirks and contradictions, but that’s half the charm.","China  Attractions in China  Be here for New Year  Falling sometime between late January and late February each year, Chinese New Year sees a week-long national holiday and generous helpings of fireworks, traditional food and lion dances. It's a family affair across much of the country, but the larger cities allow you to get a good sense of how important the event is to the country as a whole.  Circle Mount Kailash  Tibet's Mount Kailash is the holiest mountain on Earth, sacred to one fifth of the planet's population. It's some undertaking to even reach it, given its beautifully remote location, but once you're here, a clockwise circuit of the peak (pilgrims walk around, rather than up, the mountain) is one you'll never forget. Allow three days for the circular walk.  Climb Tai Shan  The UNESCO-listed Tai Shan has been of sacred importance to the Chinese since as long ago as the 11th century BC. Today, heading to Shandong province to climb to its summit has become a rite of passage for many. Don't expect earth paths and rock scrambling, however – the main route is paved, with 7,000 steps lying between bottom and top.  Cruise the Yangzi River  China's longest waterway is also its most aesthetically powerful, the Yangzi's famous Three Gorges serving up heart-soaring panorama after heart-soaring panorama. Joining a river cruise is the best way to experience the scenery at length – the insatiable appetite for the activity among the Chinese themselves tells its own story.  Encounter pandas in Chengdu  Panda sightings in the wild are elusively rare, even in the creature's home patch of western Sichuan, but the province gives good opportunity to see the animals up close. The large Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding, close to Chengdu, is no two-bit zoo – its bamboo forests do a good job of simulating the pandas' natural environment.  Explore Beijing’s hutongs  The Chinese capital isn't just about grand monumental buildings. Its traditional hutongs (alleyways), many of which still stand, retain a neighbourhood feel and give a glimpse into daily life not seen on the large avenues. You might stumble across anything from microbreweries to cafes.  Explore the Forbidden City  Beijing's inimitable Forbidden City is one of the world's great historical treasures, a vast palace complex with a superbly preserved collection of ancient buildings. It takes its name from the fact that – as home to the Emperor – it was off-bounds to mere mortals for 500 years. Directly adjacent to the complex spreads Tiananmen Square, the world's largest public square in the world.  Follow the Silk Road  Trace the ancient Silk Road trading route, which once ran from Xi'an through deserts and mountains to the Caspian and Mediterranean seas, bringing Buddhism and Islam into China – and a thousand other things besides. Key sights include Dunhuang's Buddhist grottoes, the ruins of Jiaohe city near Turpan and Kashgar's lively Sunday market.  Get a feel for Tibet in Lhasa  Whether Tibet should be seen as a part of China is a matter of opinion. Less up for debate is the fact that the regional capital, Lhasa, contains some astonishing cultural sights. Top billing goes to Jokhang Temple in the heart of the Old Town, and the majestic Potala Palace.  Hike Tiger Leaping Gorge  China has some incredible scenery, much of which is best seen on foot. A prime example is the plunging scenery of Tiger Leaping Gorge in northwest Yunnan, where the towering snow-capped mountains are threaded with hiking trails. It stands as one of the deepest gorges on the planet – spectacular doesn't come close.  Immerse yourself in Shanghai  In the cutting-edge atmosphere of economic powerhouse Shanghai, soaring skyscrapers contrast with the European-style Bund waterfront while the art deco laneways of the former French Concession sit alongside on-trend boutiques and galleries. Home to some 24 million, this is a city going places.  Lake-gaze in Hangzhou  Shop for silk and tea in the ancient Chinese capital Hangzhou, once described by celebrated traveller Marco Polo as 'the most beautiful and magnificent city in the world'. Popular with Chinese and foreign tourists, its main attraction remains the highly photogenic West Lake scenic area.  Marvel at Zhangjiajie  In a country brimming with preposterously dramatic landscapes, the Zhangjiajie area in Hunan province boasts arguably the most incredible of the lot. Its jagged sandstone pinnacles look like something from a CGI movie – indeed, belief holds that James Cameron took inspiration here for the unearthly landscapes in his movie Avatar.  Rent a bike  Some 300 million Chinese use bicycles to get around. Hire shops are everywhere and cycling is one of the best ways to see China's countryside. Popular cycling routes include the area around Yangshuo in the south – renowned for its stunning karst scenery – and the dramatic high-altitude plateaus in the west of the country.  See the Terracotta Army  The Terracotta Army, close to the city of Xi'an, is an enormous collection of Chinese warriors made out of hardened clay. Created in the 2nd century BC for Shih Huang-Ti, the first emperor of a unified China, the figures were entombed with him upon his death. The interred army was discovered by chance in 1974, and remains a phenomenal attraction.  Seek out Buddhist monuments  Travel out to the monumental carved Buddhist effigies of Yungang Grottoes, near the city of Datong, or arrange a trip to see the tens of thousands of statues at Luoyang's 5th-century Longmen Buddhist Caves. Elsewhere, at Bingling Lamasery near Lanzhou you'll find 34 early Buddhist caves, while the Mogao Caves in Gansu province still play home to some of China's oldest shrines.  Set foot on the Great Wall of China  Work on the Great Wall started more than 2,000 years ago and the end result stretches some 5,400km (3,375 miles) across the hills to the west of Beijing (although contrary to legend, it can't be seen from space). The heavily restored Badaling section is the most visited stretch, but many alternatives exist, including remote 'wild wall' stretches that can still be walked.  Take a garden walk in Suzhou  2,500-year-old Suzhou is China's own Venice, its Grand Canal and famous water gardens once helping it to draw artists, painters and scholars in droves. There's still plenty to make a visit worthwhile – away from the gardens themselves, make sure you set aside time to visit the IM Pei-designed museum.  Take a trip to Hainan  It may come as a surprise, but China has some impressive tropical beaches. Sanya, on the southern coast of China's most southerly province, Hainan Island, is one of China's most popular holiday areas and has international resort hotels, fine sand beaches, golf courses, coconut palms and watersports. Hawaii eat your heart out.  Try out tai chi  Try the ancient 'shadow art' of tai chi, a series of linked, slow movements based on the principle of using the entire body to focus the mind. Traditionally practiced early in the morning in parks and public squares throughout China, it can be seen in places including Beijing's Beihai Park and People's Square in Shanghai.",asia,,
maldives,"The Maldives is a by-word for luxury, romance and tropical bliss. A beautiful string of low-lying coral islands in the Indian Ocean, they're also a paradise for diving enthusiasts and sun-seekers alike.      The country's 26 natural atolls and over 1,000 islands boast uniformly perfect coasts dropped like pearls in the warm waters of turquoise blue lagoons. With bright white powdery sand fringing most of the islands, it’s not surprising that over a million visitors come here each year.      The tourism industry began to blossom in the 1970s and now is the Maldives’ most lucrative industry. The luxury market is its unique selling point, and it is home to some of the world’s best hotels. Pretty much every resort has its own private island, complete with personal butlers and in-room massages. Such opulence has made it a firm favourite with honeymooners, who revel in the possibility of escaping to a romantic haven. The islands also offer slightly less pricey options, and some resorts are aimed at families and divers.      The Maldives are extremely low lying (80% of the territory is less than 1m/3.3ft above sea level). As such, the islands have worked hard to become one of the most environmentally friendly countries on earth and continue to so. Luxury and tourism have often been essential in providing economic benefits to local inhabitants who struggle to utilise local resources.      Recently, it has become more feasible on the Maldives for independent travellers and backpackers to avoid the luxury hotels and stay among the local people. The growing number of private guesthouses may well give the Maldives a new lease of life away from big-money tourism. What luxury means, after all, is in the eye of the beholder.","Maldives  Attractions in Maldives  Addu Atoll  Beautiful Addu Atoll, the most southerly of the Maldives island groups, is definitely worth visiting. There are four main inhabited islands and a smattering of around 20 uninhabited islands and sandbars. Lush greenery covers these islands and villages are surrounded by trees heavy with tropical fruits. This atoll is particularly famed for its coral Here, the coral is said to be the best in the country, and there is an influx of large manta rays and sea turtles. The modern road linking Gan's Equator Village resort to the city of Hithadhoo is a great place for a bike ride.  Big game fishing  A fishing trip on a modern speedboat equipped for big game fishing is a great experience for any wannabe Hemingway. Head out during the day for tuna and sailfish, or go at night to catch grouper, snapper, squirrelfish or barracuda. Round off the trip by barbecuing the day's catch.  Boat cruise  Climb aboard a traditional dhoni (Maldivian wooden boat) and find your bliss as you cruise around uninhabited desert islands. This blissful experience is best enjoyed at dusk when the sun dips below a multi-hued horizon. As you cruise, you’ll enjoy tropical cocktails, drinks and snacks, while local musicians beat their boduberu drums to attract the dolphins.  Conservation projects  Many of the better resorts now have a dedicated team of scientists taking care of the local marine life. They will usually have volunteer programs allowing guests to get involved even for a short amount of time. Typical activities include seeding coral reefs and looking after juvenile sharks, turtles and rare fish in captivity.  Hulhule, Maldives Victory  A once in a lifetime experience for divers is the wreck of the merchant ship Maldives Victory. The wreck is submerged at 35m (115ft) below the waves near Hulhule, an island in the North Malé Atoll. Sinking in 1981, the ship has become an artificial reef, with coral, sponges and tropical fish all making it their home. Seasoned divers can explore the decks and even float through the Captain cabin.  Hulhumalé Island  The ferry trip from Malé to the nearby manmade island of Hulhumalé, is a look to the future. A utopian town, Hulhumalé is set to become the new hub of the Maldives in decades to come as sea levels rise. Predicted to be a centre of youth development and new traditions, this idyllic development was designed to be a ‘city of days out’. Visitors can take advantage of the many shopping and dining options, explore local markets, undertake wildlife safaris and dive and snorkel. At 2m above sea level, it is mountainous by local standards.  Malé, Whale Submarine  Divers and non-divers alike will revel in the opportunity to journey into the underwater world of the Maldive’s teeming reefs. Docked a short distance from Malé, the comfortable windowed ‘whale’ submarine gives a unique perspective on the local coral reefs. Once in the depths, you will be treated to up-close views of manta rays, reef sharks and colourful fish as the submarines feeding systems attracts the creatures nearer. Be sure to bring your camera, as these sights will be a once in a lifetime experience.  Malé, fish market  The whole of Malé is a hive of economic activity – everybody seems to be buying or selling something, but this is nowhere more the case than at the vibrant, busy fish market on the waterfront, where produce fresh from the sea is gutted and sold right before your eyes. The sheer volume of the catch with massive yellowfin tuna and skipjack, barracuda, grouper and dolphin fish will no doubt impress even the most squeamish.  Malé, sightseeing  The tiny capital of the Maldives is its beating heart. Crowded and full of activity, it is a fantastic place to visit for a taste of Maldivian life away from the intimacy of the resorts. It is a quirky place, with colourful buildings and lively markets, juxtaposed with island sensibility and buzzing local culture. Though there is not a huge array of sights, a visit to the beautiful 17th century stone Hukuru (Friday Mosque) or Malé’s National Museum to see the Sultans thrones is a great way to spend the afternoon.  North Malé Atoll, surfing  For a taste of some of the Maldives’ more challenging activities, try your hand at windsurfing at Lhohifushi and Dhonveli in the North Malé Atoll. These two relatively reasonably-priced island resorts are where the country's most famous breaks can be found. The season for surf lasts from March-October.  Shop for local crafts   Many resorts offer day trips to islands where you can usually visit local artisans in their workshops and buy some of the beautiful local arts and crafts. Traditional crafts, though often limited to the tourism market, are exceptional examples of Maldivian skill. Crafts are traditionally created with coral, wood, shells, stones and natural pigments. Boat building, mat weaving and lacquer work are also popular. Malé also has several markets of fresh and wholesome food produce for those wanting to sample the local fare.  Spa visit  For an enormous range of treatments, including massages, relaxation therapies and other pamperings, make an appointment at your resort's spa – now a feature at almost every resort on the islands. For an extra special treat book a double massage for you and your partner. End your day with a traditional tea ceremony on the beach.  Underwater diving  Just one dip under the glowing blue waters and it’s easy to see why the Maldives is a top destination for divers around the world. So, get your flippers on and take a plunge beneath the surface of this extraordinarily diverse country. Some of the world’s best sites are found in the Maldives, and all resorts have professional, fully-equipped dive schools. A dive that shouldn't be missed is at Mushimasmingili Thila, where you'll see grey reef sharks, giant snappers and tropical reef fish in a pristine section of Ari Atoll. The Maldives boasts five different turtle species, and they can be found most prominently in the Baa Atoll. January to April is generally considered the best time for diving, with fine weather and clear visibility.  Villingili Island  If Malé’s crowded streets leave you searching for relaxation, make a short ferry journey to the quieter side of the Maldives and visit the tranquil neighbouring island of Villingili. Historically used as a holiday island for sultans, this hidden gem is now the perfect place to enjoy the quaintness of Maldivian life. Join the locals at the beach, watch a cricket match in the park and picnic under the multitudes of gently-waving palm trees.  Visit an uninhabited island  There are around 1000 uninhabited islands in the Maldives, many of which are no more than a scrap of sand and forest. However, some of the islands are perfect examples of picturesque paradise and those in search of a little adventure can opt for a day tour exploring their rugged shores. Another option is to combine a visit to a fishing village with a trip to an uninhabited island, where the day is often rounded off with a beach barbecue as the sunsets.",asia,,
french guiana,"French Guiana is a tropical backwater with intriguing highlights to satisfy the curious traveller: from rich wildlife encounters to cultural curiosities that sound like the setting for a Evelyn Waugh novel, including the launch site of the European Space Programme, chilling ruins of notorious penal colonies, and isolated indigenous communities.      Tucked between the Brazilian Amazon and the Atlantic Ocean, the sparsely populated country harbours an abundance of plants and animals, well protected in parks and reserves. As an overseas French département, French is the official language. With the Euro as its currency, prices are on a par with Europe, not cheap.      Despite its lack of beaches and swampy coastline, exploration of the jungle-clad interior reveals rewarding sights. St Laurent is the best gateway, an appealing colonial city and former penal transportation centre. Guided tours of the prison are available, and boats go down the Marowijne River, to visit Amerindian and Maroon villages. The welcoming locals have handicrafts for sale, and you can trek to beaches where leatherback turtles lay their eggs.      French Guiana’s most notorious penal camp was on the Iles du Salut, which include the infamous Devil's Island where political prisoners were held. Some 80,000 men died here from cruel hardship, disease and execution. Alfred Dreyfus was the most famous inmate, but it was Henri Charriere who recreated the camp’s horrors in his book, Papillon. Tours of the restored ruins relive this grim history, lightened up by the island’s rich wildlife, including parrots, monkeys and turtles.      By way of contrast, the other major attraction for visitors is the Ariane Space Station, Europe’s satellite launch centre. From the small coastal city of Kourou you can visit the centre, and watch rocket launches. Nearby are some decent beaches to lounge on afterwards, or visit the village of Sinnamary, where an Indonesian community sells handicrafts and art works.","French Guiana  Attractions in French Guiana  Browse the capital city, Cayenne  French Guiana's capital has a lively buzz with a tropical Creole flavour. You could see its main sights in a day, including the residence of the Prefect in the Place de Grenoble, the Canal Laussat, and the Botanical Gardens. The Musée Départemental Franconie and the Musée des Cultures Guyanaises feature good exhibits on indigenous peoples and the penal settlements on Devil's Island.  Canoe down the rapids  Explore the jungle interior in a dugout canoe. Trips range from an hour and a half to full day adventures and take place throughout the country, including the Kourou, Iracabo, Counamana and the lower Sinnamary. The rivers are a mixture of calm water and more challenging rapids, such as those at Hermina.  Cast a line into the ocean  Sea fishing is a popular sport, which you can do from Cayenne's rocky shore, as well as from boats in the open sea. Freshwater fishing and fly-fishing are also popular on the lakes and rivers. Cayenne-based Amazon Fishing Tours runs a variety of sea-fishing trips or to Petit Saut Lake, Mana and Kaw Swamp.  Explore the infamous Iles du Salut  Guyana's most famous attractions is the Iles du Salut archipelago, which includes the infamous Devil's Island, where political prisoners and Henri Charriere's Papillon were held. Do not miss the Iracoubo Church painted entirely by hand by the famous convict Huguet. There is a hotel (an ex-mess hall for the prison warders) on Ile Royale.  Go birdwatching in the Mouragues Nature Reserve  Discover nature and wildlife at the Mouragues Nature Reserve, which stretches from Roura to Régina and is renowned for its diverse scenery and flora. Head south towards Brazil to the Kaw Swamps, near Roura, which are host to many species of birds, such as the toco toucan and the flamingo, as well as caiman.  See the jungle from the ground or the air  Much of the interior of the country is covered with huge swathes of primary tropical forest, protected as a national park. You can buzz over the jungle canopy on a microlight plane, or negotiate the winding trails on a mountain bike, with trips organized in Cayenne, Saül, Montsinery-Tonnegrade, St Laurent and St Georges.  Shake your booty at Cayenne Carnival  Carnival starts after Epiphany and goes on until Ash Wednesday. Every Sunday for over two months, carnival groups in Cayenne, Kourou and St Laurent de Maroni parade to frenetic music in multi-coloured costumes. Mardi Gras is the parade of the red devils. Ash Wednesday sees the crowd dressed in black and white to witness the death throes of King Carnival.  Take off to Kourou  A gateway to another universe, the city of Kourou is home to the Guyana Space Centre, which happens to be the European Space Agency's main spaceport. Ultra-modern buildings dominate the city; there are several restaurants and a couple of good hotels, too. If you're lucky your visit might coincide with a rocket launch; the picturesque Fourgassier Falls, located about an hour away, are a good place to cool your heels.  Turtle spotting  Leatherback, green and olive ridley turtles all come to nest and lay their eggs on Guyane's isolated beaches. The animals are closely protected but you can join a tour to watch them at Remire-Montjoly, Cayenne's best beach, or at Amana, in the west.  Leatherback turtles lay their eggs from April to July, green turtles from Jan to May, and olive ridleys from June to August.  Visit an Amerindian village  The Wayana are some of the last remaining Amerindian people living along the north coast of South America. Many still follow traditional lives, supplementing their incomes by selling handicrafts to tourists. You can visit riverside Amerindian villages in Haut-Maroni and Haut-Oyapoc. Visits are restricted and a permit must be obtained from the Préfecture in Cayenne.",caribbean,french overseas possessions,
palestinian national authority,"With fertile river plains and scrubby desert, Mediterranean olive groves and many historical marvels, Palestine has plenty to offer. Sadly, war and outbreaks of violence have badly damaged the appeal of this hotly contested land. But despite the widely held perception, Palestine is not a tourist-free zone, with more than two million travellers arriving each year.      The bulk of tourists head for Bethlehem, largely through organised tours from Jerusalem. The main attraction is the Church of the Nativity, thought to mark the spot where Jesus Christ was born. There’s also the winding Star Street, believed to be the path Mary and Joseph took on entering the city.      Far from just a pilgrimage site, Bethlehem is fascinating for what remains of the ancient biblical town, as well as its little medina-style streets and bustling market. Foreign investment is trickling through the city, which isn’t as down-at-heel as many expect, with a few museums now open and lots of shops.      Adventurous tourists head for the Separation Barrier, just outside Bethlehem; apart from dividing Israeli and Palestinian territories, the wall is covered in spectacular graffiti by local and international artists including Banksy.      At present, the majority of tourists stick to Bethlehem. But Hebron in the southern West Bank is the largest city in the territory and essential viewing, not least for its fabled souks. The ancient city of Jericho is also attractive for its garden restaurants and stunning Hisham Palace, while Ramallah, the de facto capital of the Palestinian Authority, is interesting for its lively energy and ubiquitous cafés.      Travel to Gaza, a densely populated slither of coastal land bordering Egypt and separated from the rest of Palestine by Israel, is nearly impossible – especially after the devastating 2014 conflict. But the West Bank remains surprisingly accessible, and while travel advice should be heeded, it is relatively safe.","Palestinian National Authority  Attractions in Palestinian National Authority  Explore the ancient city of Jericho  With a history dating back more than 10,000 years, Jericho is quite the showstopper. Thought to be the oldest continuously inhabited city in the world, it features remnants of prehistoric settlements and many of Palestine's most important historical sites. It also stands an incredible 450m (820ft) below sea level  Follow the old Wadi Qilt route  Hike the ancient route along the Wadi Qilt, a canyon-like valley, taking in caves, geysers, an aqueduct and St George's Monastery as you go. It is about a full day's walk from Ein Fawwar to Jericho, with the monastery in the middle.  Learn about culture at the Arab Women's Union  One little-known treat in Bethlehem is the Arab Women's Union. Its ethnographic museum near the Church of the Nativity features traditional pottery, embroidery and handicrafts, as well as an exhibition of the refined possessions enjoyed by Palestinian families in the British Mandate era, which stand in stark contrast to the lives of Palestinians today.  Make a pilgrimage to the biblical town of Bethlehem  In Bethlehem, wonder at the Milk Grotto where the holy family took refuge during their flight to Egypt; a drop of Mary's milk fell to the ground, apparently turning the grotto white. Other sites include King David's Well, Herodion, Church of the Nativity, Beit Sahour and, more recently, the Israeli Separation Barrier with its incredible graffiti, including works by Banksy.  Marvel at Jerusalem's Old City  Get lost in Jerusalem's Old City, which dates back to the 16th century. Its labyrinthine four quarters (Arab, Jewish, Christian and Armenian) are enclosed within limestone walls. The long list of places of historical and religious significance includes the Western Wall, Church of All Nations and King David's Tomb.  Party in buzzy Ramallah  Not far from Jerusalem, Ramallah is also known for its buzzing nightlife and the best restaurants in Palestine. Smoke a water pipe, often referred to as an argila, in one of the many coffee houses or restaurants, or visit one of the many nightclubs or music venues.  Relax in the Dead Sea  Float like a cork in the Dead Sea, the lowest place on Earth. Its waters are four times saltier than normal seawater meaning you can't sink – so lay back, relax, and even read a paper, if you like. Home of the fabled Dead Sea scrolls and tantalising ancient history, the Dead Sea is today a well-developed tourist hub.  Venture into the Gaza Strip  It's rarely possible or advisable these days, but if the political climate allows, venture into the Gaza Strip to explore the numerous important historical sites such as the Omari Mosque, Napoleon's Fort, Sayyed Hashem Mosque and the Byzantine ruins in the north.  Visit the Mount of Temptation  Take a walk or ride a cable car up to Jericho's Monastery of Temptation on the peak where Christ is believed to have spent 40 days and nights fasting and meditating, not to mention tempted by the Devil. Apart from the biblical significance, there are terrific views across the Jordan Valley.  Visit the Sanctuary of Abraham  Pay your respects to the Sanctuary of Abraham (Al-Haram Al-Ibrahimi) or ""Tomb of the Patriarchs"". It is revered by Muslims, Christians and Jews as the site of the tombs of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives and the place of David's anointment.  Wander the ancient town of Qumran  Explore Qumran where the Dead Sea Scrolls, including the scroll of Isaiah, were discovered in more than 30 caves set in desert cliffs in 1947. In the Qumran national park you'll find ruins of the town destroyed by the Romans almost 2,000 years ago. The scrolls themselves are stored in the Israel Museum in Jerusalem.  Wonder at the ancient Pools of Solomon  Picnic in the beautiful grounds surrounding Solomon's Pools, three ancient reservoirs located about 4km (2.5 miles) south of Bethlehem. Thought to date back more than 2,000 years, these remarkable pools are named after the biblical King Solomon, who is believed to have built the First Temple in Jerusalem.",middle east,,
alaska,"Known, appropriately, as the Last Frontier, Alaska is a land of unfathomable natural beauty, a state so vast and wild that parts of it remain unmapped today.      Everything about Alaska nudges the extreme end of the scale. The largest state in the USA, it boasts some 3 million lakes, 3,000 rivers, 100,000 glaciers and 17 of America’s 20 highest peaks.      These untamed landscapes harbour a diverse range of wildlife, including Kodiak bears, giant moose and the iconic bald eagle, whose shrill call echoes the grandeur of this state.      For adrenaline junkies, Alaska offers a big hit. Mt McKinley, the highest point on the continent, rises 6,194m (20,320ft) in Denali National Park and tempts climbers from around the world to tackle its snowy peak.      Elsewhere, kayakers paddle beneath jumbo glaciers with humpback whales, while skiers and snowboarders whoosh up the Chugach Mountains by helicopter and glide back down on virgin powder.

switzerland,"Combining expansive greenery, slick cities and bucketfuls of fresh air, Switzerland is a stylish tourist destination that offers countless outdoor adventures and contemporary urban breaks.      Switzerland’s Alpine vistas are so picture perfect, they appear to have been plucked from a postcard or the pages of a storybook. But these disarming landscapes are alive and kicking, as the myriad spots for skiing, hiking or mountain biking can attest. Ski resorts like Zermatt (home to the lofty Matterhorn), Verbier and celebrity-studded St Moritz provide everything from big, bad Olympic runs to encouragingly gentle novice slopes. And when the snow melts at low altitudes, the white-tipped mountain peaks remain against a backdrop of blue skies, providing a superb setting for summertime hiking.      The ancient capital Berne provides almost endless opportunities for sightseeing, shopping and traditional folk entertainment, while Zurich leads the way in art, design and nightlife, from opera and world-class theatre to stylish bars and nightclubs. Geneva is the sleekest and most upscale of Switzerland's cities, acting as home to a thriving community of expats, many of whom work for the numerous international organisations that are headquartered there.      Yet Switzerland’s cultural offerings don’t stop there. When it comes to contemporary art, polished Basel reigns supreme, with more than 40 museums and galleries nestled in this compact city. For a few days every year, Basel takes centre stage for the eminent Art Basel fair. French-flavoured Montreux also steals a moment in the cultural spotlight when it becomes the centre of focus for the jazz world during the Montreux Jazz Festival. Elsewhere, dotted around green foothills, are countless spruce towns and folkloric villages, where ancient farm culture survives and cattle still loiter amid flower-filled pastures.       Small, mountainous and wealthy, Switzerland is renowned for its enviable quality of life, with public services ticking along like clockwork. Come for the creamy, complex cheeses, smooth chocolates and luxury watches; stay for the exquisite culture, incredible scenery and sheer sense of fun.","Switzerland  Attractions in Switzerland  Appenzell villages  See the Switzerland of old with a drive through rustic Appenzell, the most traditional canton, with its picturesque villages of ornately painted houses set in lush, rolling landscapes. Säntis is Appenzell's most famous peak, with memorable views over six nations: Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Liechtenstein and Switzerland. The mountain Hoher Kasten (1794m/ 5886ft) is also worth a visit.  Basel  Discover the ancient university and trading city of Basel. Straddling the Rhine between the Jura region, Alsace in France and Germany's Black Forest, Basel is a centre for both art and research. Don't miss the Art Museum, the ancient red sandstone Münster (Cathedral) or the kinetic wonderment that can be found inside the Jean Tinguely museum. Learn about papermaking and book printing at the Basel Paper Mill. Or, visit for the Basler Fasnacht, a pre-Lenten carnival with three days of grand masked parties, street parades with fancy costumes and an impressive lantern display, which is made even more illuminating with the city’s lights switched off. In front of the City Theatre there is a fabulous Tinguely Fasnacht Fountain.  Bern  Visit the the medieval, arcaded streets of the capital, Bern, a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Site situated on the Aare River. Famed for its Zytglogge, a 12th-century clock tower, here you can roam the city or get lost in the Bear Park - a woodsy, forested area that plays home to a family of bears (following the 2009 closure of Bern's iconic bear pits). A reminder of the capital's ursine emblem can be seen throughout Bern on flags, statues, stained-glass windows and souvenirs.

Lausanne  Lausanne's highlights include the Cathédrale Notre-Dame de Lausanne, the Musée Olympic (Olympic Museum) and the Musee de l’Art brut. While a stroll along the promenade of the old Port d'Ouchy reveals a slower pace of life, the city's vibrant side can be found among the contemporary architecture of Flon, where boutique shops, cinemas and evening entertainment have replaced derelict warehouses, buoyed by the town's two universities.  Montreux Veytaux  Chillon Castle is the most famous castle in Switzerland. It enjoys a spectacular location on the eastern edge of Lake Geneva, near Montreux, with the Dents du Midi Mountain in the background. Built in the 13th century, visitors can see the famous jail and learn of François de Bonivard, the castle's most famous prisoner.

Follow Alpine mountain passes through Bellinzona with its three medieval castles; past the sweeping Contra Dam (the site of the James Bond Golden Eye bungee jump) to Locarno and Lugano's celebrated lake resorts in Southern Ticino. Or take the panoramic train Gotthard Panorama Express to Ticino through the Gotthard base tunnel.  Valais  Whether you climb up them, ski down or just capture them on camera, the Valais region (the valley) in southern Switzerland possesses lofty glacial peaks, such as the Dufourspitze (4,634m/15,217ft), Dom (4,545m/14,911ft), Weisshorn (4,505m/14,780ft) and the Matterhorn (4,478m/14,692ft). Popular resorts here include Saas Fee, Verbier and Zermatt, where you can take Europe's highest aerial cable car up the Little Matterhorn, then ski back to the car-free village on one of the longest ski runs in Europe. Those with the leg power will also want to cycle around the Matterhorn, a beautiful backdrop for rides with many trail entries beginning at over 3,000m high (9,842ft).  Vaud  Join the Swiss in their favourite pastime: hiking. Strap on your hiking boots and stroll through the terraced Lavaux Vinyards in Vaud. These sweeping grounds date back to Roman times and are a UNESCO World Heritage site. They span for nearly 2000 acres, but you’ll have plenty of opportunity to rest with a glass of wine on the trail from St Saphorin to Lutry at a traditional cellar or pub.  Zurich  Explore Zurich, Switzerland's largest city. The old town, Altstadt, is especially picturesque. See the gothic Fraumünster, with its stained-glass windows by Chagall; the imposing twin-towered Grossmünster cathedral; the Swiss National Museum; and the modern art and Nordic expressionist collections at the Kunsthaus Zurich. The Dada artistic movement began in Zurich; enjoy its quirky output at the Cabaret Voltaire bar.",europe,,
northern mariana islands,"The Northern Mariana Islands consist of a chain of 14 islands nearly 89km (55 miles) in length. Volcanic in origin, they host a variety of scenery including beautiful bays, spectacular cliffs, caves and mountains.  Because of the islands' location they played a significant part in World War II, having been tussled over by the US and Japan, and the many shipwrecks around the coast bear witness to this. Diving in the clear waters is popular, both for exploring the numerous coral reefs and the the jaw-dropping wrecks on the ocean floor. It was also from here – namely the tiny island of Tinian – that the US sent B-29s to drop the atomic bomb on Japan.  There are quite stark contrasts on the island. The capital of Saipan is overly commercialised for the tastes of many, full of tourbuses and characterless modern buildings. But it is also busily adjusting to ongoing economic woes, largely linked to the near-disappearance of what was once a thriving Japanese-tourism market.  Beyond Saipan, traditional Chamorro culture endures, if not completely intact. These islands were settled by émigrés from South East Asia as long as six thousand years ago, with the islanders' ancestors are known to have built a network of giant megaliths, little of which has survived. In 2013, archaeologists theorised that the first settlers of the Marianas made the longest uninterrupted ocean-crossing voyage in the history of humanity. Archaeological evidence also points to Tinian being the first Pacific island outside Asia to have hosted settlers.  Beyond the history, both wondrous and grim, the Northern Mariana Islands enjoy white beaches, azure waters and stunning flame trees. Hiking and snorkelling count as the main leisure activities here, and both are highly rewarding. The incredible sunsets are also not to be missed.","Northern Mariana Islands  Attractions in Northern Mariana Islands  Admire the underwater world  Northern Mariana's limpid waters and bountiful marine life make it popular with divers and snorkelers. But if you'd rather explore the underwater world and remain dry, take a glass-bottomed boat to Isleta Maigo Fahang (Bird Island), a beautiful, unspoiled island whose waters abound with sea life.  Enjoy the spectacular views  There are some fantastic viewpoints across the region that will light up your Instagram feed. But beware because some beauty spots have dark histories: Puntan Sabaneta (also known as Banzai Cliff) and Laderan Banadero (also known as Suicide Cliff) are where hundreds of Japanese soldiers and civilians jumped to their deaths to avoid capture.  Explore the Banadero command post  Visit the last command post of the Japanese Imperial Army known as Banadero, with WWII cannons, tanks and artillery preserved in a limestone cave. Situated on Tinian, the area is marked by Japanese memorials to commemorate the bloody fighting and loss of life during the island's involvement in the war.  Get saucy at the Tinian Hot Pepper Festival  Usually held in February to mark the President's Day weekend. It's also to celebrate and honour the small but fiery, donni sali pepper that is indigenous to the island. Expect plenty of hot food and steamy revelry that spills out onto the beaches and normally quiet backstreets.  Go underground in Rota  Hop over to Rota, a small and friendly island with a variety of natural attractions. Outside the main villages of Sinapalo and Songsong, intrepid visitors can find sights such as Toga Cave, a huge limestone cavern with stalactites and stalagmites, so large it was used as a wartime hospital.  Join in the Fiesta  There are many chances to attend a village fiesta in honour of local patron saints. The main celebration is the San Isidro Fiesta, an annual jamboree held every March on Rota. The event features a coronation ceremony and a religious procession with many other activities.  Marvel at the House of Taga  Also on Tinian, visit the House of Taga, a temple or meetinghouse associated with the legendary chief Taga. It consists of magnificent stone pillars, carved in the traditional way and transported from nearby coastal areas. Also on the island, you can see the remnants of WWII with many structures such as the Atomic Bomb Pits.  Roll along to Rota Latte Stone Quarry  Rota's answer to Stonehenge, the ancient megaliths at this stone quarry formed part of an unfinished settlement of which little is known. Created by the indigenous Chamorros people, the quarry is located near Sinapolo and sits in pretty gardens. Well worth a visit.  See the sights near Wedding Cake Mountain  While on Rota, see the fascinating Wedding Cake Mountain, which resembles a layered cake. Located near to Songsong village, the official name for the mountain is Mount Tinubal. Curious artefacts can also be viewed at the Rota Cave Museum, located in a gigantic limestone cave.  Take a trip to Tinian  Take a trip to the southern island of Tinian, which has a rugged coastline with tiny coves. At Abbas on the northern shore, there are blowholes where incoming waves shoot 6m (20ft) into the air. Tourism is the main industry on the island, although it is far less developed than its neighbours.",oceania,pacific islands of micronesia,
wales,"Though Wales forms an integral part of the United Kingdom, it often sits in the shadows of its high-achieving neighbours. But treat Wales as an after thought and you’ll be missing a trick.      It may be small, but Wales is resourceful, squeezing in green hills, bustling cities and colourful seaside villages, fronted by UNESCO-listed beaches. Its people are welcoming but passionate, harbouring the spirit of the iconic red dragon that adorns its national flag.    Starting at the top, the beautiful island of Anglesey (Wales’s largest island) has shot into the limelight recently thanks to the residency of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. But ask any local and they’ll tell you the island has long been revered – some North Walians still consider it to be the true heartland of Wales. Tread carefully.    Further down the mainland lies the awe-inspiring Snowdonia National Park, home to Snowdon, Wales’s highest peak, not to mention some of the best hiking trails in the British Isles. The restaurant at the summit offers album-worthy panoramas and is arguably the best spot in the country to sample Welsh oggie (a lamb and leek pasty).    To claim that the journey to the south of the country transcends time from traditional to modern Wales is overly dramatic, but there is a wisp of truth in this remark. Sleepy villages give way to modern cities and the national tongue, for the most part, slips from Welsh into English.    Here, the cities of Swansea, a stone’s throw from the surfer-strewn sands of the Gower peninsular; Newport, a modern port city emerging from its industrial roots; and Cardiff, the cosmopolitan capital, dominate the landscape and provide ample opportunities for urban adventure.    These modern cities have not abandoned their heritage, though; scattered amongst them are museums, medieval castles (Cardiff, Coch and Caerphilly to name a few) and historic sites chronicling the redundant coal mining industry, a big part of the nation’s identity.    Granted, it may lack the pulling power of its heavyweight neighbours, but Wales is a country that rewards the adventurous.","Wales  Attractions in Wales  Conquer Snowdon  Drink in some spectacular views and hike up Mount Snowdon, Wales' highest mountain, situated in Snowdonia National Park. At 1,085m (3,560ft) Snowdon is the UK's highest peak outside the Scottish Highlands. There are various routes to reach the summit, ranging from the straightforward to the nerve-jangling.  Cross over to Anglesey  Cross the Menai Strait to the island of Anglesey, notable for its long stretches of wild coastline (most of which is officially designated an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty) and being home to the UK's longest place name: Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch. For reasons of practicality, the village is commonly called Llanfair PG.  Get active  Wales' rocky landscapes and tumbling waters provide ideal settings for high-octane outdoor activities such as white-water rafting, abseiling and caving. A relatively recent attraction is Zip World, in Penrhyn quarry near Bangor – the zipline reaches speeds of up to 75mph (120kph), making it one for the thrill-seekers. And something a lot muddier? Try bog snorkelling.  Go for a paddle in Llandudno  Enjoy this popular seaside resort's 19th century charms, where a huge sweeping bay looks out over the Irish Sea while the limestone headlands of Great Orme and Little Orme rise in the background. There's still plenty in the way of traditional British seaside charm, as well as some stately Victorian architecture along the seafront.  Go green at CAT  Located close to the market town of Machynlleth is the Centre for Alternative Technology, an educational attraction dedicated to environmental issues and sustainable energy use. Expect interactive displays and kid-friendly activities alongside a full programme of events and tours. The site actually generates renewable energy of its own.  Go to a rugby match  Wales remains a rugby nation at heart, so a visit to Cardiff's Millennium Stadium on an international match day is generally a feisty occasion. The ground has the advantage of being right in the heart of the city, meaning a colourful pre-match atmosphere in the surrounding pubs.  Hike in the Brecon Beacons  Breathe in the fresh air of south Wales' biggest inland draw: the green upland scenery of Brecon Beacons National Park. Hikers and mountain-bikers will be in their element, and it's a great spot for star-gazing too, being officially recognised as a Dark Sky Reserve  Learn about mining  Experience Wales' days as an industrial powerhouse by visiting the former coal-producing valleys located inland from Cardiff. Blaenafon, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, offers a superb heritage attraction in the form of the Big Pit National Coal Museum. It includes the possibility of taking an underground tour.  Relax on the Gower Peninsula  This breathtaking stretch of land is one of Wales' most prominent natural treasures. Stretching out next to less-than-pretty Swansea, the Gower Peninsula is a bevy of pretty coves, crashing waves and jagged cliffs. Head to the enormous Rhossili beach – often voted one of the UK's best – for vast stretches of sand, glistening waters and surfing lessons.  Retrace the steps of Dylan Thomas  One of the greatest writers and poets ever to come out of Wales, Dylan Thomas still occupies a special place in national culture. Learn more about his life and legacy by visiting his Swansea birthplace and other significant locations such as Newquay and Laugharne.  See Wales by train  The Ffestiniog Railway passes through glorious scenery in the Snowdonia National Park, while the Welshpool and Llanfair Railway passes through gentler countryside close to the English border. Another scenic option, the Snowdon Mountain Railway, climbs to the summit of Wales' highest peak.  Spend time at the National History Museum  Get to grips with the roots of Welsh culture at St Fagans' popular open-air National History Museum. Set in the grounds of a huge 16th-century manor house, the 'living museum' includes more than 40 original buildings, including a farm, a school and houses. Craftsmen still showcase traditional skills.  Spend time in Cardiff  The Welsh capital is a lively place to spend time, with busy pubs, quality restaurants and first-rate cultural attractions (including the Doctor Who Experience, Time Lord fans). Be sure to take in Cardiff Castle and the revamped Cardiff Bay area.  Step back in time at Conwy Castle  Constructed between 1283 and 1289, the strikingly handsome Conwy Castle was one of a number of fortresses built in North Wales to subdue the Welsh Princes. Dominating the town of Conwy itself, it sits high on a rocky plateau above an estuary, backdropped by the dramatic scenery of Snowdonia.  Visit history at Chepstow Castle  The construction of Chepstow Castle began in 1066 just after the Battle of Hastings, and was the first castle in Britain to be built entirely of stone. It opened its doors to tourists for the first time in 1953 and today features life-size models of its former inhabitants and rulers.",europe,united kingdom,
russia,"Russia is at once breathtaking and baffling. Winston Churchill’s much-quoted line that the world’s largest nation represented “a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma” is as true today as it was back then.      Monumental in every respect, it’s a land where burnished imperial splendour coexists with icy Siberian tundra, where timeworn Soviet-era monuments backdrop uber-hip urban cultures and where everything from the ruling party downwards functions in its own, impenetrably Russian, way.       The west of the country draws the most visitor attention, thanks to the presence of two extraordinary cities. St Petersburg and Moscow serve up sweeping postcard sights by the dozen. Moscow is the rapidly beating heart of the “New Russia,” where Asia and Europe combine to create a boisterous, enigmatic metropolis on a grand scale. St Petersburg, meanwhile, with its living film-set of palaces, cathedrals and waterways, is the grandest and most European of Russia’s cities, yet still retains a deeply complex character.       Exploration beyond these two main hubs, however, is well advised. The Golden Ring, a collection of ancient towns northeast of Moscow, still has plenty of period architecture and is easily accessed from the capital.  By cruising along the mighty River Volga, meanwhile, it’s possible to travel south towards the Caspian Sea and see the country beyond its increasingly westernised veneer. And those heading east, into Siberia, will find a land of varied, often sublime natural beauty. From Lake Baikal to the old imperial city of rkutsk, and from the mountains of the Altai and the shamans of Tuva, Siberia has many secrets.       A combination of the above is drawing an increasing number of tourists to the Russian Federation – that it remains as obscure and mysterious as ever is all part of the charm. As the poet Fyodor Tyutchev once said: “Russia cannot be understood.”","Russia  Attractions in Russia  Bolshoi Theatre  Moscow's Bolshoi Theatre (www.bolshoi.ru) holds regular performances of opera, as well as being home to the world-famous Bolshoi Ballet Company, among the oldest and most prestigious of its kind anywhere.  Catherine Palace  Sitting 29km (18 miles) outside of St Petersburg, the Catherine Palace acted as a summer residence for a succession of different tsars. It’s perhaps best known for being home to the Amber Room – a stunning array of amber panels looted by Nazis and since recreated.  Experience ‘White Nights’  If you're in St Petersburg at the height of summer, don't expect too much kip. By dint of its northerly location, the city experiences some three weeks of 24-hour daylight from mid-June, a time at which the streets and riverbanks never sleep.  Go skiing  In the Western Caucusus, Krasnaya Polyana (also known as Red Valley) has 25km (16 miles) of runs, making it a magnet for the country’s skiers and snowboarders. Elsewhere in the country, the Kamchatka Peninsula has the potential for a dramatic heli-skiing trip, and Sochi, the home of the 2014 Winter Olympics, offers vast slopes with a huge variety of skiing available for all abilities.  Irkutsk  A common stop-off for those tackling the Trans-Siberian Railway, Irkutsk is worthy of a day or two's exploration, particularly for those interested in learning more about Siberian culture. Try and catch a bandy match – a kind of al fresco ice hockey.  Kola Peninsula  The Kola Peninsula offers exceptional salmon-fishing – 18kg (40lb) catches are almost a regular occurrence – while Siberia and the Far East also provide a rich variety of angling options, catering for everyone from beginners to experts.  Lake Baikal  Set close to the Mongolian border, the world's deepest lake is also one of the clearest, and a trip around some, or all, of its 2,000km (1,242 miles) coastline makes for an awe-inspiring wilderness encounter. Unless snowmobiling's your thing, the summer months are best.  Lenin’s Mausoleum  The embalmed body of revolutionary leader Vladimir Lenin has been on public display almost continuously since his death in 1924. Filing past the regularly moisturised corpse – still in a smart dark suit – is an odd experience, but one not easily forgotten.  Moscow’s nightlife  The Russian capital has a famously wild nightlife. You may have to shell out to get into the trendier spots – this is one city where luxury means luxury – but there's also no shortage of lively places where the emphasis is more on partying than profits.  Mount Elbrus  Mount Elbrus is the tallest mountain in the Caucasus and, indeed, Europe itself. Standing 5,642m (18,510 ft) high, it makes for a strenuous but not overly technical climb. Six-day trekking circuits are available for those who fancy looking down on the rest of the continent.  St Isaac’s Cathedral  An impressive reminder of St Petersburg's tsarist-era design, St Issac's Cathedral was 40 years in its construction, eventually being unveiled in 1858. The bright golden dome was actually repainted grey during the war to avoid undue attention – it's now back to its former glory.  St Petersburg’s Canals  The size and grandeur of imperial city of St Petersburg has a tendency to amaze first-time visitors, and there are few better ways of appreciating the architecture of the centre than in the comfort of a leisurely canal cruise through its heart.  The Kremlin  Some visitors are surprised that there's any access at all to the Kremlin – there's actually enough to see to warrant more than one visit. Most famous of its attractions is the Armoury Museum, a treasure-trove of Fabergé eggs and imperial bling.  Trans-Siberian Railway  The Trans-Siberian railway is perhaps the single most iconic rail journey in the world. The week-long voyage from Moscow to Beijing is the most popular route, and takes you through some of the planet’s most remote wilderness. The sheer length of the trip gives you an idea of the scale of the area you’re covering – over 9,000km (5,600 miles).  Vladivostok  If you've made it this far east, congratulations. Fringed by hills and overlooking the Golden Horn Bay, Vladivostok is actually one of the country's most attractive cities. There's a number of diverting historical sights, as well as good access to beaches.  Volgograd  Renamed Stalingrad during the socialist era, Volgograd has the dubious honour of being the site of one of WWII's most infamous battles. The city was levelled by the conflict, but has recovered to become an interesting destination for history buffs.  Yusupov Palace  Your jaw will no doubt drop at St Petersburg's gorgeously decorated Yusupov Palace (www.yusupov-palace.ru). Its rooms are sumptuously decorated in 19th-century style and include a gorgeous mini-theatre. A waxwork exhibition also commemorates Rasputin, who was murdered here.  Zero-gravity flight  Ever wanted to experience complete weightlessness? Join a zero-gravity flight at Star City, part of the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Centre (http://www.gctc.su), 40km (25 miles) from Moscow. Guests can in a modified cargo plane, which rises to 6000m (19685 ft) before a further steep ascent allows passengers to float weightlessly around the plane. It’s not cheap, but then, this isn’t your average tourist activity.",europe,,
venezuela,"With its reputation for violence and political instability, many travellers opt to give Venezuela a wide berth. But those brave enough to visit this feisty South American nation will discover a country of extraordinary diversity and abundant natural beauty; a land of lofty Andean peaks, mysterious Lost World plateaus, wildlife rich rainforests, vibrant cities and idyllic Caribbean islands.     At the heart of all this lies Caracas, Venezuela’s thronging capital. A hotchpotch of hillside favelas, crumbling colonial buildings and glistening skyscrapers, the city has much to offer visitors; there’s a fine collection of museums, galleries and historic monuments, not to mention a pulsating nightlife. Even the food’s good, nowadays. But for all its appeal, most of Venezuela’s attractions lie beyond the capital city, hidden away in national parks and reserves which cover an impressive 40% of the country.      The lush tropical lowlands of Los Llanos harbour abundant wildlife, with eco-conscious hatos (ranches) offering safaris to view caiman, puma, anaconda, capybara, hundreds of birds and much more. Then there are the table-top mountains of the Guyana Highlands, whose summits loom over golden savannahs and bristle with prehistoric flora and fauna. These towering peaks spawn dramatic waterfalls, including the awesome Angel Falls, officially the world’s highest.      Those with an appetite for adventure can be sated with an excursion into the virgin rainforest of Amazonas, Venezuela’s least-visited region, where indigenous communities cling onto traditional lives in the jungle. Alternatively, head to Mérida to tackle the soaring Andean peaks or go piranha fishing in the Orinoco, South America’s second longest river, which empties into the wildlife-rich wetlands of the Orinoco Delta.      Beyond that, the clear waters of the Caribbean lap onto Venezuela’s stunning coastline, where numerous offshore islands provide ample opportunities for reef diving, partying and pandering to pleasure. Amongst them the Los Roques archipelago, which is the epitome of Caribbean island idyll and a very long way from the unsavoury headlines of the mainland.","Venezuela  Attractions in Venezuela  Climb Mount Roraima  Marvel at the eerie majesty of Mount Roraima, the inspiration for Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's The Lost World. Spanning the borders of neighbouring Brazil and Guiana, Roraima is the tallest of the Gran Sabana's tepuis (table-topped mountains). Its sheer rock faces are pierced by graceful waterfalls and its ancient crags are lined with endemic, insect-eating plants. Adventure companies take organized treks up Roraima, a challenging but thrilling expedition requiring a minimum of five days.  Dance with the devil in San Francisco de Yare  Every year as part of the Corpus Christi celebrations in May or June, up to 100 dancers in ghoulish devil masks perform a colourful ceremony in the small town of San Francisco de Yare, south of Caracas. Based on a Catholic tradition dating back to the Middle Ages, the ""Diablos Danzantes"" can also be seen in several towns along the central coast, including Cata, Chuao, Cuyagua, Naiguatá, Ocumare de la Costa, and Tinaquillo.  Dive at Parque Nacional Mochima  Snorkel, swim, dive or fish at Parque Nacional Mochima on the northeast coast, with hundreds of offshore islands and islets. Some – like the popular Isla de Plata – are surrounded by coral reefs; and there are countless beautiful beaches for just lazing around. The archipelago Los Roques is another underwater wonderland, fantastic for birdwatching, diving and snorkelling off its gorgeous white-sand beaches.  Enjoy a slice of German life in Colonia Tovar  Check out Colonia Tovar, a slice of Deutschland in the forested mountains west of Caracas. Settled by German immigrants from the Black Forest in the mid-19th century, the town retains its Old World traditions, food and architecture. With its quaint rustic hostels and homemade culinary specialities, Colonia Tovar makes for a touristy but surreal excursion from the capital.  Explore downtown Caracas  The capital, Caracas, is a modern metropolis set in the foothills of the Ávila range. Besides a fabulously varied culinary landscape, a vibrant cultural life and throbbing nightlife scene, the city also boasts an array of world-class museums. The city is one of South America's most dangerous, but it offers a loud and brash welcome for first-time visitors, most of whom escape to the countryside's gentler attractions after a couple of days.  Go on safari in Amazonas  Get up close to birds, monkeys and caiman on a jungle safari in the far south Amazonas region. Based in the largest town of Puerto Ayacucho, specialist tour operators take river trips to lodges deep in the jungle, where you can go wildlife watching. Treks to see spectacular tepuis (table-top mountains) such as Auyan-Tepui and Cerro de la Neblina are also available.  Head underground in Cueva del Guácharo  Burrow down into the Cueva del Guácharo, the most spectacular of Venezuela's many cave systems. Here you can discover the fascinating guácharos (oilbirds), the nocturnal birds that inhabit this subterranean dwelling and which flock out of the cave mouth at dusk in their thousands, screeching eerily.  Kick back in Coro  Linger in the beautifully preserved centre of Coro, an early colonial settlement near the Caribbean coast. The town is on UNESCO's list of World Heritage Sites and is also the gateway to the Paraguaná Peninusula, a prime windsurfing destination. Surrounding Coro are the Médanos de Coro, a national park composed of huge sand dunes, the country's only desert landscape.  Make your way to Mérida  Get to know Mérida, a delightful university city perched amidst snow-capped Andean peaks. More than just an excellent base for hiking, wildlife watching and whitewater rafting, Mérida has a rich cultural history, with several fine art and archaeology museums and buzzing nightlife.  Marvel at Angel Falls  Angel Falls is the tallest waterfall in the world, and, for many, it is also the most stunning. Its glistening waters spill from the rim of an ancient sandstone tepui (table-topped mountain) into a freefall of nearly one kilometre (0.6 miles) before crashing into a pool. Double rainbows can often be seen in the spray-drenched air above. Located in Canaima National Park, 600km (373 miles) south of Ciudad Bolívar, the waterfall is a sacred site for the local indigenous people.  Move to the sound of Joropo  Catch a display of Joropo, Venezuela's national dance, in Los Llanos, the vast plains region where it originated. The flamenco-influenced step is accompanied by musicians playing harp, guitar and maracas and singing in a high-pitched nasal style. Local Joropo groups perform at family parties and street concerts throughout the country, but the best places to see it in Los Llanos are in Guanare and San Fernando de Apure.  Observe perpetual lightning at Lake Maracaibo  Marvel at the magical natural phenomenon of lightning minus the accompanying thunderclap at the Parque Nacional Ciénagas del Catatumbo, along the southwest shore of Lake Maracaibo. The spectacular displays of forked lightning storms over the water can be witnessed daily throughout the year. The park is also rich with birdlife and animals, including capybara and manatees.  Pick up your binoculars in Cuare Wildlife Refuge  Admire large colonies of pink flamingos and scarlet ibis at the Cuare Wildlife Refuge, a coastal reserve adjoining the Parque Nacional Morrocoy, about four hours north of Caracas. Best glimpsed in September, the flamboyant fowl are among many water birds that congregate in the lagoons near Chichiriviche and along the mangrove canals.  Ride the Teleferico de Mukumbari  Ride the world's longest and highest cable car, which runs a staggering 13km (8miles) from Mérida to the top of Pico Espejo, which kisses the sky at 4,765m high (15,629ft). Called Mukumbari, which means ""the place where the sun is born,"" the cable car offers easy access to starting points for carious mountain treks, though it's worth riding just for the sake of it.  Ski in the Andes  Enjoy the novelty of skiing in the tropics: the highest Andean peaks of the Cordillera de Mérida have a permanent snowline and can be skied between November and June, though at an altitude of 4,270m (14,000ft) this is recommended only for the hardiest. Several of the country's highest peaks are located here and specialist local agencies offer experienced guides and equipment in the nearby city of Mérida.  Spot wildlife in Parque Nacional Henri Pittier  Train your binoculars on hummingbirds, herons, tanagers, toucanets, and curassows; just a few of the 580-plus exotic bird species at the Parque Nacional Henri Pittier a birdwatchers' haven on the central northern coast. This is the oldest national park in the country, and also home to jaguar, puma and monkeys. The main entrance is at Rancho Grande, between Ocumare and Maracay.  Take a break on Isla de Margarita  Swim, soak up the sun and savour superb seafood on Isla de Margarita, Venezuela's largest Caribbean island. With 168km (104 miles) of beaches, it offers everything from the full-on buzz of its principal town Porlamar, to mangroves, marshes and sand dunes. There are many national and international flights and charters to Porlamar, as well as daily air-shuttles from Maiquetía airport, and ferries from Cumaná, La Guaira (Caracas) and Puerto la Cruz.  Visit the indigenous people of “Little Venice”  Take a tour from Maracaibo north to the Guajira Peninsula, via the Sinamaica Lagoon, where the indigenous people of Venezuela live much as they did when the first Spanish settlers arrived, dwelling in houses that are raised above the lake on stilts. The stilt houses reminded the conquistadors of Venice, prompting them to name the country ""Little Venice"".",south america,,
latvia,"Officially known as the Republic of Latvia, this small nation remained tucked behind the Iron Curtain until the early nineties. Today it is one of the most visited countries in the Baltics and lures visitors with its dramatic landscapes, rich heritage and vibrant capital, Riga.      Declared European Capital of Culture in 2014, the city has one of the most impressive collections of art nouveau buildings in the world, not to mention a stunning UNESCO World Heritage downtown. The latter is home to medieval churches, grand Renaissance properties and a spectacular market, which is held inside defunct zeppelin hangers from WWI. The old town is dominated by Riga Cathedral, the largest medieval church in the Baltics and one of many attractions in Riga vying for visitors’ attention.      The path beyond Riga is, for now, not quite so well-trodden. However, riches await those pressing further into the country; there’s the rural paradise of Rundāle Palace, the recently renovated Turaida Stone Castle and the charming Latvian Ethnographic Open-Air Museum. The beautifully preserved historic towns of Kuldīga and Cēsis also warrant excursions.      Latvia is rich in natural attractions, too, like the Gulf of Riga and the windswept coastline along the Baltic Sea, which is home to seemingly infinite sandy shores. Jūrmala, a resort town just 40 minutes from Riga, boasts 26km (16 miles) of golden beaches lined with spas, thermal mud pools and seafood restaurants.      Inland, national parks and nature reserves abound, but Gauja National Park is the most famous. This picturesque river valley is a place of unremitting beauty: rushing rivers, ancient sandstone cliffs and, in spring, masses of white cherry blossoms. Gauja National Park is not only great for hiking, cycling and watersports, but also offers one of the best birdwatching sites in Latvia, after Pape and Cape Kolka.      While low cost air travel has opened Latvia to the masses, most visitors still struggle to venture beyond the capital. However, those who do find treasure in this country will, as the tourist board likes to say, discover it is “best enjoyed slowly.”","Latvia  Attractions in Latvia  Basilica of Aglona  A place of pilgrimage for Catholics from all over Latvia and beyond, this immense white cathedral near Daugavpils, with its twin spires, is worth visiting even if you are not religious (tel: + 371 2918 8740; www.aglona.travel). To see the basilica at its most atmospheric, visit during the Feast of the Assumption (15 August) when around 150,000 worshippers take part in a torch lit procession celebrating the Blessed Virgin Mary.  Birdwatching in Pape  Latvia's coast, wetlands and traditionally cultivated farmland attract significant populations of interesting and uncommon birds. Pape, near Liepāja along the Kurzeme coast, is on the migration route for seabirds, wildfowl and other species – 200 breeds total. It is also a haven for songbirds and raptors. Cape Kolka is another good spot for birdwatching. Local operators can arrange birdwatching trips upon request. For more information, contact the Latvian Ornithological Society (tel: + 371 6722 1580; www.lob.lv).  Cape Kolka  The windswept beach at Cape Kolka, part of the Slītere National Park, is a breathtaking spot where the Baltic Sea and the Gulf of Riga crash together. It’s also a good place for a brisk walk along the shore and a great spot for birdwatching. The skyline features the wooden Kolka Lighthouse, originally set aglow in June 1875 and still luring visitors to the cape today (tel: +371 2914 9105; www.kolkasrags.lv).  Cēsis  Old wooden buildings, cobbled streets, attractive churches and impressive castles transport you back through layers of history in Cēsis (www.turisms.cesis.lv). One of Latvia's oldest towns, it was first inhabited in the 13th century. Cēsu, one of Latvia’s best-known beers, has been brewed in the well-preserved medieval city since the 16th century. The town even has an annual arts festival that celebrates traditional and contemporary Latvian culture.  Daugavpils Mark Rothko Centre  The great 20th century abstract expressionist painter Mark Rothko was born in Daugavpils, in southeast Latvia. The Daugavpils Mark Rothko Art Centre, housed in a renovated arsenal building dated 1833, is a multi-functional institution of culture, arts and education. Featuring the main exhibition “Mark Rothko: Life and Art,” the centre houses original Rothko works and shows a digital exposition on the artist’s career. 2013 marked the 110th anniversary of Rothko's birth. (www.rothkocenter.com)  Ethnographic Open-Air Museum of Latvia  Just outside Riga and alongside Lake Jugla is the Ethnographic Open-Air Museum of Latvia (tel: +317 6799 4106; www.brivdabasmuzejs.lv). Established in 1924, it is one of the oldest and best preserved outdoor museums in Europe. It boasts historical dwellings, workers' homesteads, a tavern and windmills, all gathered from across Latvia. Masters of 18 different crafts demonstrate their work at this artisan community.  Fly high in Sigulda  The cable car from Sigulda to Krimulda features a birds-eye view of the Gauja River Gorge. For adrenaline junkies, bungee jumping can be arranged from the cable car when it stops some 42m above the river itself (tel: +371 2838 3333; www.bungee.lv). Krimulda also has a ruined castle and a sprawling landscape that can be absorbed on the seven-minute aerial ride (tel: +371 2802 0088; www.cablecar.lv).  Freedom Monument  Not only is this vaulting statue at the heart of Riga, it also commemorates the hardships that Latvian citizens have endured over the years and serves as a poignant symbol of nationhood. That it survived communist rule at all is a miracle. It stands over 42m tall and is topped by the figure of a woman holding three gold stars, symbolizing Latvia’s three cultural regions: Kurzeme, Latgale and Vidzeme.  Hiking in Gauja National Park  Latvia's national parks and protected areas boast myriads of hiking trails. Gauja is the country's biggest and oldest national park, covering an area of nearly 900 sq km (340 sq miles) around the River Gauja. It features caves, rocks and dense woods, and plenty of wildlife. One of the most popular trails is the 5km Līgatne nature trail, where visitors can see many species of wild mammals native to Latvia (tel: +371 2832 8800; www.visitligatne.lv). Visit in spring if you want to see the mass of wild cherry trees blooming along the Gauja River valley. Latvia has four national parks – the others are Ķemeri, Slītere and Rāzna (the country’s newest).  Kuldiga  This attractive town proudly promotes itself as the home of Europe's widest waterfall. While the gushing torrent is impressive when the Venta River runs high, Kuldiga (www.visit.kuldiga.lv) is an attractive historic settlement well worth exploring year-round. The city also hosts a “traditional nude run” every Summer Solstice.  Latvian Song and Dance Festival  Held only once every five years and dating back to 1873, the Latvian Song and Dance Festival is one of the country’s greatest musical and cultural events. Along with the Song and Dance festivals in neighbouring Estonia and Lithuania, this week-long celebration is inscribed on the UNESCO list of Intangible Cultural Heritage. From vibrant folk costumes to intricate choreography and harmonies, the event combines the talent of some 30,000 dancers, singers, artists and musicians.  Liepaja  Its old town buildings may be a little faded but Liepaja (www.liepaja.lv) still boasts attractive architecture, including many art nouveau buildings. It has the largest concentration of preserved wooden houses in Latvia, some dating back as far as the 17th or 18th centuries. The real highlights, though, are its seaside park and sandy EU Blue Flag beach. In Karosta, a former Russian naval base, you can take a tour of a KGB prison museum (tel: +371 2636 9470; www.karostascietums.lv).  Riga's art nouveau architecture  Riga boasts one of the finest collections of art nouveau buildings in the world, accounting for around a third of the properties in the city centre. Riga is also famous for its old town, which has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. With its attention to detail and push toward modern design, Riga’s art nouveau buildings are an architectural site to behold. Be sure to stroll down Alberta Street and visit Riga’s Art Nouveau Centre (tel: +371 6718 1464; www.jugendstils.riga.lv).  Skyline Bar  The chic, 26th-floor Skyline Bar at the Radisson Blu Hotel Latvija (tel: +371 6777 2282; www.radissonblu.com) offers epic 360-degree views over Riga. The same dramatic views can even be enjoyed from the toilets. An extensive drinks menu with over 100 cocktails complements the vistas, and weekend DJ performances feature the newest dance music.  Spas in Jūrmala  Spa holidays are all the rage in Latvia, especially in Jūrmala (tel: +371 6714 7900; www.visitjurmala.lv). The ever-growing number of spa hotels in this Baltic resort are backed up by a seemingly endless sandy beach. Indulge in an aromatherapy massage or something a bit more unusual, like a salt chamber.  Stay in the land of the Blue Lakes  It’s possible to rent log cabins amidst the Latgale forest, which boasts 2,000 of Latvia’s 3,000 total lakes. Some properties are located next to lakes where the hearty can take a swim, while others have their own saunas. The peaceful retreat of “Laimavoti” – meaning the spring of happiness – offers an intimate look at Latvia’s natural beauty (tel: +371 2755 9999; www.laimavoti.lv).  Built on a peninsula and surrounded by Cārmanis lake, the resort sits along the borders of Belarus and Russia.  Turaida Museum Reserve  One of Latvia's most popular attractions throngs with tourists and Latvian school children who come to ramble around Turaida Castle, one of the country’s most attractive citadels. There are striking views over the Gauja National Park from its ramparts, while the landscaped grounds boast several oversized esoteric sculptures. It was specially commended in the European Museum of the Year Awards in 1996 (tel: +371 6797 2376; www.turaida-muzejs.lv).  Watersports on the Gauja River  The winding Gauja River in beautiful Gauja National Park offers plenty of opportunities for watersports, from white-water kayaking to river rafting. Anyone seeking an extended watery adventure can stay at one of the national park's 23 campsites.

finland,"Finland is the big surprise of the Nordic countries, a natural wonderland with over 179,000 islands and more trees than people. With miles of empty wilderness, the Finns are uniquely in tune with their natural surroundings. This is a nation where people can flip from office work to foraging for wild mushrooms in a heartbeat.      The culture of the Finns has been shaped by the historic tug-of-war between Sweden and Russia, leaving dotted enclaves such as Russian-tinted Karelia, and the Swedish-speaking regions of Åland and Ostrobothnia. Even the Finnish language is an anomaly, curiously related to Hungarian.      For most, the gateway to Finland is Helsinki. A friendly and surprisingly small capital city, here historic churches rise above tidy public squares and stone wharfs are crowded with market traders and ferryboats. It’s probably the best place to encounter Finland’s famous party spirit, especially during the light nights of midsummer.      Vast areas are protected by Finland's 40 national parks, providing fantastic opportunities to spot birds, reindeer, elks and bears. Around 10% of Finland is covered by water and 75% of the country is covered by forests, providing a natural adventure playground for trekkers, mountain-bikers, cross-country skiers, dog-sledders, as well as fishing and watersports enthusiasts. No wonder sisu (meaning ‘hardiness’) is seen as integral to the Finnish character.      The cosmopolitan south, with its bustling cities and sleek, modern design sensibilities (this is, after all, the home of Alvar Aalto and Marimekko) seems a long way from rugged Lapland, where the Sámi people have been herding reindeer for millennia. For tourism purposes, Lapland is also the home of Father Christmas, ensuring a busy Christmas season at the Santa theme park near Rovaniemi.      Perhaps Finland's most famous contribution to world culture is the sauna – with an estimated 2 million of them, there are more saunas than cars in Finland. Enjoying a visit to the sauna, ideally after a bracing dip in a wilderness lake, is practically mandatory for all visitors.","Finland  Attractions in Finland  Admire modernist masterpieces  The Finns are rightly proud of Alvar Aalto, a giant of 20th-century architecture, and Jyväskylä, an appealing Lakeland university town, contains many of his most famous buildings. Come August, Jyväskylä revs into action as it hosts the Finnish round of the World Rally Championship.  Brave the cold for ice fishing  Every winter, thousands of Finns drill holes in the ice and try their luck at the masochistic sport of ice fishing, with a bottle of Kossu (Finnish vodka) on hand to keep the chills at bay. Of course, if you want to avoid hypothermic conditions, you could always go fishing during the summer by a lake or the shore.  Celebrate Midsummer  Go up north and you will find the sun never truly sets during the summer months, and Finns take full advantage of the 24-hour daylight to party through the night. Midsummer is also the time when thousands of locals retreat to their mökit (summer cottages) in the countryside to enjoy the great Finnish outdoors.  Delve into Sámi culture  The capital of Sámi culture in Lapland, the tiny village of Inari is home to the wonderful Siida museum and the Pielpajärvi Wilderness Church, a meeting place for reindeer herders since at least 1646. Nearby Lemmonjoki National Park is the largest in Finland, and a popular destination for trekkers and gold-panners.  Discover Karelian culture  Split in two by the Russian border, the district of Karelia marches to the beat of its own drum. It’s famous for its Orthodox Christian culture, unique cuisine, distinct language, traditional villages and its centuries-old religious festivals. It is also the setting of the Finnish national epic, the Kalevala.  Don your skis  During the icy Finnish winters, cross-country skiing is not just the most efficient but often the only way to get around. There are marked tracks all over the country, including in many national parks. Fans of downhill skiing and snowboarding should head to the hills of Lapland for an exhilarating time.  Eat and drink al fresco in Oulu  Famed for its beer terraces and technological whizz-kids, Oulu is one of the most appealing cities in Finland, particularly in summer, when stalls selling wild berries and seasonal foodstuffs fill the marketplace. Stock up on supplies for a picnic on the bird-filled wonderland of nearby Hailuoto Island.  Enjoy culture and nightlife in Turku  The oldest town in Finland, Turku gazes across the archipelago towards Stockholm in Sweden. The main attractions include the town’s magnificent medieval castle, stately cathedral and intriguing museums, while the lively nightlife, centred on the floating 'boat bars' moored along the Aura River, provides ample light relief after dark.  Escape to the snow-covered wilds  Point your nose northwards and keep going until you reach Finland's Arctic wilderness. Mystical and awe-inspiring Lapland is home to traditional Sámi reindeer herders, around 300,000 reindeer and three spectacular national parks, as well as, of course, the region’s most famous resident: Santa Claus.  Explore handsome Helsinki  The Finnish capital is aesthetically pleasing; its architecture reflects its Russian and Swedish past as well as the more recent Scandi-style modernism of famous Finnish architects. Good design is ubiquitous; almost every café and shop will have a quirky chair, chic lamp or covetable coffee cup you’ll wish you had in your own home.  Go climbing in Kilpisjärvi  In the far northwest corner of Finland, a tiny spit of land juts out between Sweden and Norway. Climb from the village of Kilpisjärvi to picturesque Saana Fell or Halti Fell, the highest peak in Finland, and look out over three countries from one spot.  Harness up huskies  There are few more thrilling experiences than whizzing across the snow on a traditional Arctic sled. After some expert instruction, you’ll be put in the driving seat to mush your very own dog sled through the wintery Finnish landscape. There are numerous dog-sled centres in Lapland, such as Hetta and Äkäskero.  Hit the waters of Lakeland  ‘Land of a thousand lakes’ may be Finland’s nickname, but also an understatement; there are in fact 187,888 of them. They provide a natural adventure playground for swimmers, canoeists, fishermen and boating enthusiasts, as well as people who just appreciate the soothing calm of still waters. With one lake per 26 Finns, there is more than enough space for everyone. The heart of the lake country is Lakeland in eastern Finland.  Meet Santa Claus  Nudging into the Arctic Circle, Rovaniemi is home to Santa Claus Village, where there are child-friendly, Santa-themed attractions and the opportunity to meet Santa Claus himself. Explore SantaPark, where you can take part in Elf school, make gingerbread biscuits with Mrs Gingerbread and even send greetings from the Post Office.  Party at Finnish Festivals  Some of Finland's festivals are just plain bizarre. Attendees engage in rock mimes for Oulu’s Air Guitar World Festival, husbands haul their wives like sacks of potatoes for the Wife-Carrying World Championships in Sonkajärvi, Naantali's laziest resident is tossed into the sea on Sleepyhead Day, and thousands of people go down the Vantaa river and drink beer in rubber boats during the annual Kaljakellunta, or Beer Float festival. It’s safe to say festivals and parties in Finland are very unique.  Scan the night skies  Searching the Arctic skies for the spectacular Northern Lights (Aurora Borealis) takes a lot of dedication but is definitely worth it in the end. Watch the spectacle transform the skies over Finland into a psychedelic light show during the polar night (kaamos) from November to May.  Sleep outdoors in Savonlinna  Famous for its medieval castle and its summer opera festival, Savonlinna is an enchanting jumping-off point for exploring Lakeland. The surrounding lakes and forests are full of camping grounds that provide a perfect base for watery activities and birdwatching.  Stay overnight in a lighthouse  The southernmost destination in Finland, Bengtskär lighthouse is an impressive building perched alone on an island of bare rocks. The tallest lighthouse in the Nordics, Bengtskär functions as a home to lighthouse keeper Paula Wilson, and she runs it as a hotel between June and September. The granite sauna dating back to 1907 is available for guests to use.  Sunbathe on the beaches of Pohjanmaa  See a different side of Finland in the Swedish-speaking villages that sprawl along the west coast near Vaasa. Also known as Ostrobothnia, this region offers long sandy beaches, warm summer weather, forested islands full of swimming elks, and quaint wooden villages such as Jakobstad and Kristinestad.  Sweat it out in a sauna  Sweating your troubles away in a steamy sauna is one of the quintessential Finnish experiences. Most hotels and holiday cottages have saunas, but there is a special magic to the Jätkänkämppä smoke sauna just outside Kuopio, and the super-modern architecture of Löyly in Helsinki’s Hernesaari district is sure to impress.  Try exhilarating watersports  When the Finns can't ski on snow, they do the next best thing: ski on water. The 1,000-plus lakes of the Lakeland region provide some fantastic opportunities for water-skiing, jet-skiing and sailing. Many holiday cottages and outdoor centres offer water-sports facilities.",europe,,
turks and caicos islands,"Blessed with an abundance of natural riches – white powdery beaches, pellucid waters and some of the best reefs in the Caribbean – the Turks and Caicos Islands have a reputation for exclusivity. That may not be entirely fair, but this 40-island archipelago is certainly skewered towards the well heeled, with its credit card-melting hotels and private island resorts, where the rich and famous go to escape the hoi polloi.      If your bank balance can’t stand the heat, there are affordable options to be found on the likes of Grand Turk, the largest island, where visitors can take in the delights of Governor’s Beach or head offshore to bathe on Little Sand Cay, a tiny island comprised of white sand and a handful of swaying palms.      A visit to Salt Cay off Grand Turk offers a rare opportunity to view migrating humpback whales. Come on a full moon and you could also be treated to a natural light show courtesy of the bioluminescent glowworms, which inhabit the local waters. Swimming with stingrays off Gibbs Cay and kayaking through nearby salt marshes are just some of the other diversions.      It’s not all about the coast, though. There are numerous parks, reserves and historic attractions inland, such as Cheshire Hall, a crumbling colonial plantation where guides regale visitors with historical anecdotes about the islands.      Those seeking culture should head to Grand Turk, where you will find the archipelago’s capital, Cockburn Town, which is home to exquisite colonial era buildings, a smattering of museums and a handful of restaurants. A sophisticated, more upbeat vibe prevails on the island of Providenciales, which boasts lively beach bars, some excellent restaurants and the venerable Provo Golf & Country Club, one of the Caribbean’s finest. Those who fancy escaping the crowds can hop on a ferry to nearby North Caicos, an island of few people and many flamingoes.","Turks and Caicos Islands  Attractions in Turks and Caicos Islands  Bask on the beaches  Powder-fine, soft and white, the sands of the Turks and Caicos Islands are the stuff of romance. Chill out on the beaches that line Providenciales' renowned Grace Bay, or seek out your own private spot; there's plenty of choice, with some of the best on North and Middle Caicos.  Dive on pristine coral reefs  Exquisite coral reef formations and excellent underwater visibility have brought diving fame to the islands, especially Providenciales, West and South Caicos, and the Turks Islands. Marine species that can be observed include turtles, spotted eagle rays and manta rays, as well as numerous colourful reef fish.  Escape it all on North Caicos  Known as the ""Emerald Isle,"" North Caicos has miles of deserted white sandy beaches with gentle surf and excellent snorkelling, along which hotels providing luxurious accommodation… and all just a short ferry ride from Providenciales. Flamingos, ospreys, iguanas and various other wildlife can be seen at the island's nature reserve. The ruins of the Wade's Green Plantation, built in 1789 to raise cotton and sisal, are also a popular destination for visitors.  Explore Cockburn Harbour  The town of Cockburn Harbour on South Caicos is situated on a small ridge at the extreme southwest of the island of South Caicos. It was once the chief port for the shipment of salt from the islands. The town is a quiet and pleasant place to potter around in the evening, with some interesting remnants of the salt industry and a few local restaurants serving fresh fish. It's also a jumping off point to discover the island's excellent beaches and reefs.  Go birdwatching  Rare birds and butterflies are bountiful on the archipelago… and so are the twitchers who come to seek them. Visitors can see wild flamingos in Grand Turk, North Caicos and Provo, where there are designated birding trails. On Provo, Northwest Point National Park offers some of the best birdwatching opportunities and you may see ospreys, pelicans, egrets, herons, and more.  Grand Turk  A few minutes from South Caicos by air, with the small metropolis of Cockburn Town, Grand Turk is the islands' seat of government and commerce, as well as their historic and cultural centre. Front Street has a number of colonial buildings, dating from the early 19th century. Visit the lighthouse overlooking North Creek on the north coast - it was shipped to Grand Turk from the UK in pieces in the 19th century and reassembled. Heritage walks and guided tours are available.  Kick back in Providenciales  Boasting luxury resorts, fine dining restaurants, coral reefs and beaches as pure as the driven snow, the island of Providenciales is the epicentre of the country's tourism industry. Most of the action takes place around Turtle Cove, with its peaceful yacht basin, and Grace Bay, which has a 19km (12-mile) beach. The island is also home to Princess Alexandra National Park, the Caicos Conch Farm (the only one of its type in the world) and the Bamboo Gallery (an arts centre).  Make friends with migrating whales  Between February and April, whale watching enthusiasts are able to observe large numbers of the North Atlantic humpback whale population passing very close to the western shores of Grand Turk and Salt Cay en route to their breeding grounds at Mouchoir Bank nearby. During this period, divers can listen to an underwater concert of whale songs; charter boats equipped with hydrophones also allow visitors to see and hear whales.  Pedal your way around the islands  A network of field-roads across North, Middle and East Caicos makes for great walking and cycling across these unspoiled islands, sometimes joining up the dots between plantations, beaches and other attractions. On Provo, the Grace Bay and Turtle Cove areas are the safest for on-road cycling, and Grace Bay has pavements for safe strolling. Of course, walking beautiful Grace Bay Beach is also very popular.  Relax on Middle Caicos  Also known as Grand Caicos, Middle Caicos is sparsely developed. The three main settlements on the island are Conch Bar, Banbarra and Lorimers. The island is blessed with a spectacular coastline, which is blessed with bluffs, small coves, limestone cliffs, sandy beaches, swampland and caves. There is a causeway linking Middle Caicos and North Caicos, so it's easily accessible for visitors.  Set sail to West Caicos  The westernmost island has an abrupt coastline leading to deep water that is ideal for fishing and scuba diving. Uninhabited, it is currently only visited by sailors, fishermen and thousands of seabirds. An ideal place to see a variety of birdlife is Lake Catherine. Ruins of Yankee Town, a railroad and a steam engine are remnants of the time when the island was habited; a more modern 'ruin' is that of the unfinished Ritz-Carlton Molasses Reef resort on the island's north end.  Step back in time on Salt Cay  The tiny Salt Cay is home to just 70 people, and a handful of self-catering villas for visitors. Uncluttered and unspoilt, its timelessness is accentuated by disused salt ponds and an almost total lack of motorised transport. Island Thyme makes a great venue for lunch or dinner.  Take a glow-worm cruise  Once a month following the full moon, the waters around the islands light up with glow worms as part of an elaborate mating ritual, and evening cruises are laid on to see this magical display.  Wander the ruins of cotton plantations  For a short time at the end of the 18th century, the cotton plantations of Cheshire Hall on Providenciales and Wade's Green on North Caicos were worked by numerous slaves owned by Loyalist refugees from the former American colonies. Now in ruins, the plantations remain evocative places to visit, and through a degree of restoration, their story lives on.",caribbean,,
syrian arab republic,"Until the recent civil war, Syria was a diverse destination that revelled in its antiquity. Inhabited for tens of thousands of years, the country accumulated all the cultural riches afforded by such a long history and was rightly considered one of the Middle East’s top destinations. Sadly, the war-ravaged nation is now struggling to preserve its ancient relics, which document the rise and fall of myriad civilisations.      Like its history, Syria’s landscapes are varied. Vast steppes cover much of the country, but mountains soar in the west, deserts stretch in the east and volcanic fields spread across the south. Meandering through this dusty land is the great Euphrates River, which also flows through neighbouring Iraq.      Syria was once regarded as a frontier region, bordered to the east by Persians and west by the Arabs. The country fell to the Persians in the sixth century and though it retained Christian and Jewish populations, Syria was from then on a Muslim nation.      The country’s story is littered with dramatic episodes. Syria was subsumed by empires from Babylon to Canaan, Assyria to Phoenicia; it was conquered by the Ottomans, endured a campaign by Napoleon and was invaded by the Egyptians. During the height of pan-Arabism in the 1950s, the country briefly joined with Egypt in the United Arab Republic, but seceded to form the Syrian Arab Republic in 1961.      The battles and territorial scrambles of the past have translated into a catalogue of staggering cities, such as Damascus and Aleppo, which are chock-full of stunning monuments and ancient mosques.      The uprising against the ruling Baath Party in 2011 gave way to a civil war, which continues to rage and is further complicated by the formidable presence of the jihadist militant group Islamic State. Travel to Syria is ill-advised (it is probably the most dangerous country on the planet right now) and the future remains uncertain.","Syrian Arab Republic  Attractions in Syrian Arab Republic  A quick update  As Syria's civil war continues to rage, the country remains a no-go for tourists. Updates on the attractions below, which once lured millions of tourists to this country, were added to this guide in 2015 and will be reviewed by our foreign correspondents when the war has finished and the dust has settled – whenever that may be.  The Crac des Chevaliers  Crac des Chevaliers is the most famous crusader castle in the world and was a stronghold of the Hospitallers during the days of the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem (1100-1290). The castle, rising from an altitude of 670m (2,200ft), was protected by watchtowers and supplied with food from the surrounding fertile countryside. The castle fared well during previous military campaigns, but is sadly being destroyed during the current conflict.  The River Orontes in Hama  Situated on the River Orontes, 45km (28 miles) from Homs, Hama has fared better than most in the civil war. Dating back to around 5,000BC, Hams is famed for its norias, gigantic wooden waterwheels, which are still used to provide water for the city and to irrigate the many public gardens. The orchards, the Great Mosque and the Al Azem Palace's Museum are also of interest.  The Royal Palace in Mari  Mari's Royal Palace was built by Zimrilim, the ruler of this important city-state some 2,000 years ago, and boasts 300 rooms and hallways. It was rediscovered in the course of excavations during the 1930s, but has been systematically looted by IS militants. Mari itself was built at a strategic point on the trade routes from the Syrian Arab Republic to Mesopotamia. The town's oldest ruins date back 5,000 years, but are currently a no go area.  The ancient city of Aleppo  A high-profile victim of the civil war, fierce fighting has taken place in the city of Aleppo, much of which has been reduced to rubble. The city contains a massive citadel, which stands on the site of a Hittite acropolis. This UNESCO World Heritage Site is one of the most magnificent examples of Islamic military architecture in Syria, but it's future is decidedly uncertain.  The ancient city of Damascus  One of the world's oldest inhabited cities, the Syrian capital has fared much better than other parts of the country during the civil war, but the security situation there is precarious. In more peaceful times, visitors flocked to the city to admire attractions such as Ummayyad Mosque, the 16th-century Tikiyeh Mosque and Al Azem Palace, which houses Islamic art and ancient copies of the Koran. Sadly, it will be a case of seeing what's left after the civil war.  The ancient city of Palmyra  Famed for its ancient Byzantine ruins, Palmyra has been plundered of its ancient treasures by IS militants and its temples (most famously that of Baalshamin) have fallen victim of the group's campaign of iconoclasm. Satellite images suggest much of this ancient city has fallen, but the true extent of the damage will not be known until the end of the war.  The minarets of Mecca  Home to some of the oldest minarets in the world, Bosra has become a battlefield in recent years. The first city in Syria to become Muslim, it was used as a stopover on the pilgrimage route to Mecca and prospered until the 17th century. By then the region, as it is today, was becoming unsafe and the pilgrims began to take a less dangerous route further west.  The seaside town of Latakia  A stronghold for president Assad, Latakia is located on Syria's Mediterranean coast. Once a major holiday resort, the town stands at the foot of forested mountains overlooking the beach and the edge of the Fertile Plains (also known as the 'Cradle of Civilisation'). There are a number of antiquities, including the ruined Temple of Bacchus and a triumphal arch.  The souks of Syria  Before the civil war broke out, visitors came to Syria in their droves and one of the many highlights for sightseers was to explore one of the country's many souks (markets). Particularly recommended was the one at Aleppo, made up of 16km (10 miles) of meandering low corridors lined with shops and bustling with activity, but that city has been a high-profile casualty of the war. Damascus' Long Souk was also wonderful.  The steamy hammams  Though the country is in a mess, parts of Syria try to cling on to some semblance of normal life. One facet of local life is to kick back and relax in one of Syria's well-preserved hammams (public baths).  The ‘Pear of the Euphrates’  Sadly the city of Deir ez Zor, once known as the 'Pearl of the Euphrates,' has been the scene of fierce fighting during the civil war. Neighbourhoods have been reduced to rubble and much of the population has been displaced. Located on the bank of the Euphrates, the city was revered for its manicured gardens and orchards, which contrasted beautifully with the golden desert hues and the silver thread of the river.",middle east,,
niger,"One of the world’s poorest nations, Niger might be a challenging destination to travel around, but rewards abound for those willing to persevere. And with political stability returning to this West African nation, it is slowly opening up to tourists.      A country shaped by Saharan trade routes, visitors came and went through this land for centuries, leaving behind them a wonderful fusion of Arab and African traditions.      Agadez and Zinder sprung up along these now defunct routes and today these cities retain their ancient mercantile charm. Comprised of beautiful adobe dwellings, their labyrinthine streets are home to bustling markets, which sell pottery, leather and other decorative pieces. Zinder is also renowned for its extravagant Ramadan festival, during which horsemen can be seen riding through the streets in the most flamboyant fashion.      Unlike Agadez and Zinder, Niger’s capital, Niamey, was never a site of trans-Saharan trade, and remained relatively unimportant until the 20th century. It continues to be possibly the least-hurried and most relaxed capital in the region. Situated on the lush banks of the Niger River, from which the country takes its name, Niamey is the commercial centre and a great place to delve into local life.      Niger’s biggest cultural event, however, occurs out in the desert town of Ingall. At the end of the rainy season the town’s population of 500 swells to several thousand as Tuareg and Wodaabe nomads attend the annual Cure Salée festival. The centrepiece is the Wodaabe gerewol, during which unmarried men adopt extravagant makeup and sing rhythmic chants in the hope of impressing a future bride.      Naturalists are also well catered for in Niger, which is home to a number of national parks, most famously W Regional Park, a haven for lions, leopards, elephants, baboons and much more. Ultimately, though, it’s Niger’s ancient cities, time-honoured festivals and nomadic culture that make this friendly country so beguiling.","Niger  Attractions in Niger  Buy a camel at Ayorou market  Trawl the animal market in Ayourou, an ancient trading station located on an island in the Niger River, close to the Malian border. While in the region, use the town of Tillabéri as a jumping off point for reaching W National Park, where you should keep your eyes peeled for the endangered West African giraffe, which clings on in the park.  Catch a tribal festival  Celebrate the end of the rainy season with the Peulh people, who mark the change in weather with a lively knees up. Alternatively, witness the Cure Salée at Ingall, when nomads gather their cattle to go to new pastures. Not to be missed is the Wodaabé tribe's gerewol, an annual courtship festival, the largest of which takes place at Ingall.  Discover Niger’s desert landscapes  Arrange an expedition through the mountains to relax at the springs at Igouloulef and Tafadek or the oasis town of Iferouane. Beyond, the Ténéré Desert offers a charismatic landscape of dunes and open plains, while the Djado Plateau is rich in prehistoric rock painting and engraving.  Experience Zinder’s labyrinthine alleyways  The Old Town in Zinder, which was the capital of Niger until 1927, is a compact maze of alleyways, typical of a Hausa settlement. Near the centre is the adobe Sultan's Palace, while the central market impresses with its sheer size alone. Artefacts in the small museum help to explain the history of the town.  Explore the Aïr Mountains  Within the Sahara Desert, the rugged Aïr Mountains rise steeply out of the desolate landscape to more than 1,800m (6,000ft), and extend over some 85,000 sq km (32,000 sq miles). A region traditionally roamed by Tuareg nomads, it is home to a surprising array of wildlife, including hyena, baboon and desert specialists such as the fennec.  Go souvenir shopping in Maradi  Niger's third largest city, Maradi is one of the country's economic hubs. As a centre for Hausa culture, Maradi hosts an artisan market for handicraft purchases in the Solitan quarter, as well as the historically important Katsinawa Provincial Chief's Palace and Dan Kasswa mosque which are well worth visiting.  Kick back in the capital, Niamey  Niamey is the country's sprawling capital, situated on the east bank of the Niger River. The Small and Grand Markets are worth a visit, as is the Great Mosque, the National Museum (including botanical gardens and a zoo) and the Hippodrome, where horse and camel races often take place.  Observe wildlife in W National Park  Named so because of the W-shaped meander in the River Niger, W National Park is the country's most important conservation area. Spanning 10,000 sq km (4,000 sq miles) across three countries, its abundant wildlife including buffalos, elephants, lions, hyenas, jackals, baboons and giraffe. The birdlife is also prolific, with over 350 species identified.  Pay your respects to the King of Dosso  Royalists may want to swing by Dosso, seat of the Dosso Kingdom, which came to dominate the region before colonialism and continues to perform a ceremonial role. The city in southwest Niger is home to an exceptional palace, museum, and lively town square. Many festivals with parades and official ceremonies are celebrated here.  Sail the Niger River  Take a canoe for a sunset sail along the Niger River, one of Africa's most important waterways and Niger's lifeblood. Fishing for some of the 250 species in the river is possible throughout the year, the main season being from February to July.  Visit the ancient trading city of Agadez  Climbing the pyramidal minaret of the mud-brick Grand Mosque at sunset provides spectacular views of Agadez, the old Tuareg capital and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Still a caravan trading city, it has a thriving camel market, but also a lively handicraft trade. Beautiful silver and leatherwork can be bought all around the city.",africa,,
sweden,"Sweden is a land of incredible contrasts, from the dense pine forests and craggy mountains of the north, to the rolling hills and glossy golden beaches of the south. But the diversity doesn't stop at the suburbs, with each of Sweden's seven major cities boasting its own character, history and unique architectural style.      Bordered by Denmark to the south, Norway to the west and Finland to the east, Sweden, the largest of the Scandinavian countries, boasts a long mercantile history that has made it one of the most culturally open and welcoming in Europe.      The instantly likeable capital Stockholm has long been synonymous with style and its sharply tailored brand of chic has percolated throughout the wardrobes of the world. Hipsters notwithstanding, Stockholm, with its 14 islands and medieval beauty, has much to offer those in search of culture, art and historical treasures. However, perhaps the most surprising city is Malmö, which has belied its unfairly grim reputation to become one of the country's liveliest destinations.      Beyond the cities, Sweden's countryside has a gentler charm than the rugged landscapes of neighbouring Norway. Much of Sweden is forested and there are thousands of lakes, including the large stretches of water between Gothenburg and Stockholm. The border with Norway is home to the spectacular Skanderna (Scandinavian) mountain chain, while in the far north you'll find wonderfully bleak Arctic tundra, where you can see the Northern Lights.     The south is dominated by emerald forests, the cerulean waters of the Gulf of Bothnia and the jagged Baltic coastline. Of all the lovely spots in Sweden though, the awe-inspiring panoramas of the Stora Sjöfallet National Park take some beating. Part of the UNESCO-listed Laponian region of northern Sweden, the park's majestic waterfalls, soaring peaks and crowded clumps of fir trees make it one of the country's greatest natural treasures.      The Swedes are proud of their green country and believe the great outdoors should be available to everyone. Allemansrätten – the everyman's right – is a constitutional right that allows the public access to public and privately owned land for recreation. As long as you do not disturb or destroy nature, or infringe on the privacy of others (such as by walking too close to their house), you are free to roam the countryside. This right even allows people to pick wildflowers, berries and mushrooms – unless they are endangered.","Sweden  Attractions in Sweden  Ancient Swedish civilisation  For history buffs, the southwestern Bohuslän province (www.vastsverige.com/bohuslan), one of the most important centres of ancient Swedish civilisation, is a must-visit. The region is also packed with museums displaying the many archaeological relics found in the area – many of which date back to the Bronze Age and Viking era.  Astrid Lindgren's World  Immerse yourself in Astrid Lindgren's fantasy world in Vimmerby in the province of Småland: Pippi Longstocking, Ronja the robber's daughter, Emil, Karlsson on the roof and many more of Astrid Lindgren's famous characters gather in Astrid Lindgren's Värld (alv.se). In summer, there are about 50 different daily theatre performances in the park. Spend the night in one of the houses in Den Lilla Staden (The Tiny Town) and relive the life of the Bullerby children.  Beaches  In summer, make the most of Sweden's hundreds of miles of beaches, particularly on the west coast, and its 96,000 lakes. The beaches of Gotland are a popular destination, with their blue waters and white sand reminiscent of the Mediterranean. If swimming and sunbathing isn't enough, head to one of the numerous waterskiing and windsurfing centres.  Boat trips  Take a boat trip from Stockholm city centre among the islands to Drottningholm Palace (www.kungahuset.se), where the Palace Theatre opera house has been preserved in its original 18th-century form, and stages productions in period costume and using authentic instruments.  Canal cruises  If you have a couple of days to spare, take a cruise on the MS Ceres along the historic Göta Canal. Constructed in the early 19th century, the canal’s 614km (382 miles) stretch from Gothenburg in the west to Söderköping on the Baltic Sea. Tours start in Stockholm and Gothenburg (www.gotakanal.se).  Christmas  Finland might be the official home of St.Nick, but Sweden, which also possesses a large chunk of Lapland, has an ultra cool take on Christmas of its own. Take the kids (or just yourself) to Mora in the heart of the Swedish Lakeland region, where you can meet Father Christmas at the Santaworld theme park (www.tomteland.se).  Cycling  One of the nicest ways to get to grips with the Swedish capital, seeing the city on two wheels lets you get close to the magnificent Stadhuset (City Hall) and navigate the winding streets of Gamla Stan (The Old Town) with ease. For bike rental, try Stockholm City Bikes (tel: +46 (0) 77 444 2424; www.citybikes.se).  Djurgården  Take a ferry to Stockholm's Djurgården Island area, to see the world's oldest open-air museum Skansen (www.skansen.se), showcasing historical houses and farmsteads, as well as a zoo of farm animals and wild Nordic animals like wolves, brown bears and the elusive lynx. The fairground Gröna Lund (www.gronalund.com) has its entrance next to the ferry port, and is full of rollercoasters and other rides with a view over the Stockholm islands. You can also head to the Nordic Museum (www.nordiskamuseet.se), Waldemarsudde House (www.waldemarsudde.se) – until 1947, the home of royal artist Prince Eugen - and Liljevalchs Konsthall (www.liljevalchs.com) art gallery.  Fishing  Norrbotten is an angler's paradise with plenty of mountain streams and excellent sea fishing. It is situated on the so-called Midnight Sun Coast, which is a 1,500km (900-mile) stretch of Baltic coastline that runs all the way to the Finnish border.  Glassworks  German immigrants founded Sweden's crystal and glass-making industry in the southern province of Småland in the 16th century and 16 glassworks in the area are open to visitors. The Småland Museum (www.kulturparkensmaland.se/1.0.1.0/13/2/) in Växjö also has permanent exhibitions dedicated to the region’s glassmaking past, or why not try making your own glass artwork at the Stockholm Glassworks in Skansen (www.stockholms-glasbruk.se).  Golfing  Sweden has more than 400 golf courses: one situated north of the Arctic Circle enjoys 24-hour daylight during the summer months, with the interesting result that many midsummer championships take place at night.  Gothenburg  Gothenburg (Göteborg) is the home of Volvo cars and they have a museum to prove it (www.volvomuseum.com). If cars aren’t your thing, relive the city's seafaring past at the Maritime Museum (Sjöfartsmuseet) (www.sjofartsmuseetakvariet.se) or head to the pretty Nordstaden Kronhuset area, home of the fascinating City Museum (goteborgsstadsmuseum.se).  Island hopping  Head offshore - Gotland and Öland are Sweden's biggest islands, in the southeast of the country. On Gotland are the Lummelunda Caves (www.lummelundagrottan.se) with spectacular stalactites and stalagmites, and a preserved medieval town at Kattlundsgård.  Malmö  Much maligned and unfairly ignored, Sweden’s third city, Malmö (malmo.se), has undergone a renaissance in the years since the construction of the Öresund Bridge. Key sights include Malmöhus Castle and the St Petri Church. Also see Konsthallen (www.konsthall.malmo.se) and the remarkable Turning Torso skyscraper.  Medieval and modern  Founded by King Sven Tveskägg more than 1,000 years ago, the pretty town of Lund is home to a lovely 12th-century cathedral, 14th-century astronomical clock and hordes of 21st century students. The huge open air museum, Kulturen (www.kulturen.com) is in the heart of the city centre, and includes row after row of perfectly preserved mediaeval streets. There is also the spectacular Öresund Bridge, the world's longest single span bridge, between Denmark and Sweden, close to Malmö.  National collections  The Historical Museum (historiska.se/home) in Gothenburg is home to Sweden’s most important historical treasures, including prehistoric artefacts and stunning medieval art. Stockholm’s National Museum of Fine Arts (www.nationalmuseum.se) meanwhile, houses the country's stunning collection of fine art.  Naval and folk history  Delve further into Sweden's history at the Vasa Museum (www.vasamuseet.se), which contains a restored 360-year-old wooden warship recovered from Stockholm's harbour in 1961, or head to the Medieval Museum (medeltidsmuseet.stockholm.se) to see Riddarholmsskeppet, a wooden ship dating back to the 1520's.  Sami experience  Meet the Sámi people at Jokkmokk (www.jokkmokk.se), where you’ll find collections of Sámi art and cultural artefacts along with Lappstaden - an old-fashioned village of 70 cone-shaped traditional huts called Lavvu. Arjeplog also has an interesting Sámi museum, Silvermuseet (silvermuseet.se), home to an extraordianry collection of Sámi silver jewellery.  Staying fit  Whatever you're into, Sweden's many wide open spaces and endless coastline means that sporting activities are on offer just about anywhere you go. Winter sports such as skating, tobogganing, snowmobiling, ice climbing and dog sledding are particularly popular.  Stockholm Old Town  Explore the historic Gamla Stan (www.visitstockholm.com), with its collection of beautifully-preserved historic buildings bisected by winding cobbled streets. Slottsbacken, Gamla Stan’s highest hill, is home to the Royal Palace and a jumble of baroque buildings. The suburb’s main streets, Österlånggatan and Västerlånggatan, are prime shopping spots with plenty of fashionable boutiques.  The Lakelands  Sweden has more than 97,500 lakes to choose from, but the prettiest are to be found in the huge Swedish Lakeland area. Stretching from Gothenburg in the west and taking in large chunks of Uppsala and the Baltic coast; the region is rich in stunning scenery, wonderful old castles and picturesque tiny villages.  Wildlife  One of Sweden's prime wildlife watching spots, the Härjedalen Valley is the home of the country's only herd of musk oxen.      Lapland has abundant reindeer, buzzard and beaver. Lynx, wolves, brown bears and wolverines are around but rarely spotted as they prefer to stay away from humans.      Elk and deer are common around the country, and can be spotted even in urban areas.  Winter refreshment  Experience the 'ice beds' (thick sleeping bags included) and enjoy a well-earned thirst quencher in the Absolut Icebar at the igloo-esque Ice Hotel (www.icehotel.com) in the small northern village of Jukkasjärvi in Lapland. Only open during the winter, the hotel has to be rebuilt every year, as it melts during the summer. Or opt for the Ice Hotel 365 which is open year round.",europe,,
south australia,"It’s a mystery why sun-soaked South Australia is so often overlooked by travellers. Endowed with generous helpings of culture, vitality and natural beauty, not to mention some of the best wine in the Antipodes, it’s a region that waylays those who do visit for far longer than they anticipated. It’s packed with variety too, from the wildlife-clustered greenery of Kangaroo Island to the harsh desert outback of the north.      Arty state capital Adelaide is the natural focal point. Consistently ranked among the most liveable cities in the world, it’s renowned for its festivals, museums and live music scene. Locals still semi-jokingly take pride in the fact that it was founded by free settlers (there’s no convict past here) and it’s a genuinely cultured city, from its characterful cricket ground to its boulevard-style streets.      It is the wider state, however, that holds the most surprises. Visitors can stay in houseboats on the Murray River, hike the mammoth folds of the Flinders Ranges, visit subterranean houses in the wild-eyed desert town of Coober Pedy or take their time evaluating the wines of the Barossa Valley. South Australia’s long coastline draws everyone from naturalists to surfers, while the region’s much-lauded seafood includes specialities such as oysters, crayfish and prawns.      And while leaving the state isn’t likely to be a priority, when you do have to depart it’s worth knowing that Adelaide sits on two of the country’s most fabled train lines – catch the Indian Pacific east to Sydney, west to Perth or hop aboard The Ghan and venture through the Red Centre to Darwin. Or just stay a bit longer.","South Australia  Attractions in South Australia  Cage dive with sharks  Put away your fears and come face-to-face with one of nature's supreme hunting machines – a great white shark – by cage diving at Port Lincoln or nearby Neptune Island. It's an area with pedigree where sharks are concerned: scenes from Jaws were filmed here.  Cross the Nullarbor Plain  Flat, moody and massive, the Nullarbor Plain stretches for some 1,200 km (750 miles) across the bay known as the Great Australian Bight. Catch the train across its middle to understand its size, or ponder the edge of a continent as it suddenly drops 90m (300ft) to form the Bunda Cliffs, which tower above the Southern Ocean.  Delve into the past at the SA Museum  Tracing multiple millennia of local history, Adelaide's South Australian Museum includes exhibits as diverse as 10,000-year-old boomerangs, whale skeletons and gold nuggets. Its Australian Aboriginal Cultures Gallery has a superb collection of artefacts, and there's also an excellent fossils gallery.  Dive with a difference at Mount Gambier  Take the time to visit Mount Gambier, a city built around an extinct volcano. The sights here include sinkholes, limestone coastal area and the Blue Lake, which boasts crystal-clear waters that change in colour with the seasons – for qualified divers, meanwhile, there's also the chance to dive in winding limestone caverns.  Find a gem in Coober Pedy  Fossick (sift dirt from working mines) for semi-precious stones at Coober Pedy, which produces 90% of the world's supply of opals. Fortunes have been made and lost in this extraordinary outback town where half the population lives underground to escape the extreme heat.  Go underground in the Naracoorte Caves National Park  Step into the Naracoorte Caves National Park near the southeast border with Victoria and see stalagmites, stalactites, bats and fossils. The Wonambi Fossil Centre – where you'll need to go to book a tour – also has exhibits that shed light on the underground features. The remains of giant prehistoric wombats have been found in the caves.  Go whale watching  Spot whales on the Fleurieu Peninsula around Victor Harbor and on the Nullarbor coast, where large colonies of Southern Right whales breed from June to September. And if you take the horse-drawn tram across the causeway to Granite Island, you'll have the chance to see penguins too.  Head into the Adelaide Hills  The part of the Mount Lofty Ranges nearest to the city is known as the Adelaide Hills, and a trip here gives the chance to take in wineries, wildlife parks and walking trails – as well as some cracking views. The one-time German settlement of Hahndorf is the main tourist hotspot.  Look out onto Lake Eyre  Australia's lowest natural point is found at Lake Eyre, the enormous salt lake in the north of the state. Given its desert environment it's usually dry, but after heavy rainfall becomes a vast inland sea. Its bright salt crust makes it spectacular at any time.  Meet Kangaroo Island’s fauna  Spot wildlife in its natural environment on Australia's answer to the Galapagos: Kangaroo Island. You might see anything from penguins, koalas and wallabies to kangaroos, seals and sea lions. While you're here, try local produce such as marrons (freshwater crayfish) and the honey from Island Beehive.  Sail the Murray River  Strap on some waterskis, jump onto a cruise or take to the tiller yourself – there's no bad way to experience the Murray River, which meanders for 650km (400 miles) through South Australia, having travelled from New South Wales and Victoria. River red gum trees line the banks, and along its length orchards and vineyards flank the waters.  Sip wine in the Barossa Valley  The Barossa Valley attracts around 60% of Australia's wine-tasting tourists – and you'll understand why when you're here. As well as producing a very nice drop (the Shiraz is particularly renowned), it's also a strikingly attractive area, with ample potential for cellar door visits and wine-based road trips.  Step out into the Flinders Ranges  Set eyes on South Australia's immense belt of peaks and bushland, the ancient Flinders Ranges. It's a region of spectacular granite peaks and colourful gorges dotted with eucalyptus trees – there are countless great hikes on offer, with some picturesque villages serving as good bases for walkers.  Take in a festival  Indulge in a plethora of world-class festivals in Adelaide, including the Adelaide Festival of Arts, which features everything from jazz to classical theatre, and the diverse Edinburgh-style Fringe Festival. On a similar note, WOMADelaide showcases musicians from around the globe – Jimmy Cliff and Peter Gabriel are among past performers.  Try surfing  Surf excellent waves off uncrowded beaches, particularly at Victor Harbor, Kangaroo Island and the more remote Yorke and Eyre Peninsulas (Eyre's Cactus Beach attracts surfers from all over the world). Elsewhere, Moana Beach is a surfing favourite along the Fleurieu Peninsula, while neighbouring Maslin Beach became Australia's first nudist beach in 1975.",oceania,australia,
bahamas,"The quiet coves and crowd-free beaches of the Bahamas offer visitors the intimacy of a secluded retreat within a paradisiacal expanse of some 700 palm-fringed isles.      Christened baja mar (meaning 'shallow sea') by Christopher Columbus, these islands, with their astonishing hues of sand and sea spanning the colour spectrum from twinkling turquoise to rose pink, are the personification of paradise.      Crystalline waters secrete ancient shipwrecks and a rainbow of coral reefs, while pastel-coloured seashells and vibrant clapboard houses perch atop a tropical landscape that resonates with exotic birdsong.      There’s the over-riding feeling that the Bahamas has got tourism just right: a range of resorts cater for holidaymakers, including a growing range of eco-hotels, yet their impact on the islands’ natural beauty remains, by in large, minimal.      The full gauntlet of watersports beckon for the active holidaymaker: from scuba diving and snorkelling to parasailing and sailing, there’s more than enough to get the pulse racing here. Then there are the glitzy golf courses, designed by the game’s best, whose vistas are enough to compensate for a bad day on the fairways.      Pack your hiking shoes and explore the clutch of nature reserves that are scattered across the archipelago. Pack your binoculars too and look out for the myriad of bird species that call the Bahamas home: from bright pink flamingos to multicolored parrots, you can’t miss some of the more flamboyant species.      Come sundown, Bahamian bars and clubs pulsate with island rhythms; discover riotous dance festivals that mix African slave-trade rituals with Bahamian tempo and American hip-hop twists, or head to one of the archipelago’s bustling straw markets to haggle over spices, and ceramics.      If it all gets too much, recharge your batteries at one of the wonderful seafood restaurants or with an infamous rum cocktail. Whatever you do, the vividness of the Bahamas never ceases to assault your senses.","Bahamas  Attractions in Bahamas  Bathe on beautiful white sand beaches  The pale pink sands of Harbour Island are a sight to behold, while the powder-fine alabaster beaches of Paradise Island are home to soaring seabirds and gently rustling palms. Cable Beach, Nassau, is a prime spot for watersports and beach bars, whilst visitors wanting a bit of peace should take a boat to Stocking Island for less-crowded options.  Be drawn by horse and cart around Nassau  Explore the 18th-century forts and pastel-coloured Georgian architecture of the Bahamian capital on foot or, better still, by horse-drawn cart. Get the steeds to stop while you climb the Queen's Staircase, which is carved out of solid rock and offers superb city panoramas. For fascinating history and culture visit the Pompey Museum and its fine collection of island artefacts and exhibits.  Catch a haul in the Abacos Islands  Fishing is possible almost anywhere in the Bahamas but the Abacos has become the angler's choice. On hand are top-quality guides (the incomparable Edward Rolle boasts 20 years' experience) to show you tricks of the trade. For bone-fishing Andros can't be beaten and Bimini boasts the best big game. Try the Tongue of the Ocean for a deep-water haul.  Dance away at the Junkanoo festivities  With street processions, dance bands and a full-on party crowd, the Bahamian Junkanoo festivities on Boxing Day and New Year's Day are the nation's number one party. Nassau's Junkanoo is the liveliest as revellers in elaborate costumes made from crepe paper and cardboard wheel through the streets. There are other great processions in Eleuthera, the Abacos and Grand Bahama.  Discover Eleuthera's colonial charm  Eleuthera, the jewel of the Out Islands, is where the first colony on the Bahamas was established, so wandering the streets of its charming colonial villages and rolling pineapple plantations is certainly a scenic trip back in time. There are some memorable seafood restaurants to sample here too.  Dive to the lost city of Atlantis, Abacos  Amongst the wrecks strewn off the coast of the Abacos lies America's first steamship, the San Jacinto. Some of the best dive instructors in the Bahamas are on hand in the Abacos to make your dive experience first class. There are also the stone ruins off Bimini, said to be the remains of the lost city of Atlantis, to explore.   Explore the eco islands of Inagua  Inagua, the two islands making up the southern-most part of the Bahamas archipelago, is an eco-lovers paradise, with much of Great Inagua being taken up by the huge Lake Windsor. This is an internationally important bird reserve with an 80,000-strong population of West Indian flamingos. Besides birds, there's limestone caves to explore and excellent scuba diving.   Gossip with the locals  The Bahamas' People-to-People scheme helps visitors learn about the cultures, music and oratory traditions of the islanders. Get paired with Bahamian locals of a similar age to enjoy rocking-chair tales, family lunches, church meetings, local bands or just plain out-fashioned sip-sip (local gossip).  Kayak through the Lucayan National Park  This 16-hectare (40-acre) protected reserve on Grand Bahama secretes one of the world's longest underwater cave systems which (incredibly given the diminutive size of the park) boasts its own unique wildlife including the Remipedia bat. A great way to see the park's highlights is from a kayak as much of it is made up of navigable waterways.  Make friends on Grand Bahama Island  Outside fancy Freeport and Lucaya, the smaller settlements of Grand Bahama are surprisingly low-key. With their wide tree-lined streets, restaurants and cruise port facilities, they are also among the friendliest places in the country. Towns like Eight Mile Rock and McLean's Town are fabulous places to get to grips with real Bahamian culture.  Mount Alvernia, Cat Island  Climb to the highest point in the Bahamas on Cat Island's Mount Alvernia, 63m (206 ft) above sea level. Straddling the summit is a photogenic medieval-style monastery, a labour of love by one Father Jerome, who had the steps carved out of solid rock. With high cliffs and emerald forests there's plenty of opportunity for solitude seeking on Cat Island too.  Paddle with pigs around Big Major Cay  It is not known exactly how feral pigs came to inhabit Big Major Cay. All we know is that paddling with these water-loving porkies is one of the more surreal ways to spend a day in the Bahamas. The friendly pigs can be visited on boat trips to the island, which is uninhabited by humans.  See the sun go down with a rum cocktails (or two)  There are few pleasures in life as simple as sipping rum-laden cocktails (a Bahama Mama is an essential experience) on Abaco Beach at sundown, watching the golden sky turn a dramatic pink-crimson. To add to the magic, fairy lights illuminate the shore as dozens of boats gently bob out in the harbour.  Spend some time shopping in Nassau  Dozens of colourful stalls at Nassau's bustling straw market produce a melee of crowds bartering over handcrafted goods. You can join them, or, for a more sophisticated shop, splash some cash in the swish stores at Bay Street, the brightly-coloured buildings are a haven of designer brands.  Swim with dolphins at Blue Lagoon Island  At Blue Lagoon Island you can interact with sea lions displaced by Hurricane Katrina and frolic with bottle-nosed dolphins in waist-high pools – many played starring roles in the movie Flipper. Whilst dolphin shows in much of the Caribbean have notoriously dubious ecological credentials, this experience is a class above: it's interaction, rather than getting dolphins to perform.  Test your swing on some fine fairways  The islands have some memorable golf courses, though the Reef Club is perhaps the prettiest. There are five other world-class courses on Grand Bahama Island to choose from including Exuma's Emerald Reef course which was designed by golfer Greg Norman, and the Abaco Club which boasts a Scottish links-style course. For a cheap round on the beautifully kept fairways, play at twilight.  Visit untouched Andros  Revel in the natural creeks, bird-filled forests, thick mangroves, and pastel-coloured coral on unexplored Andros – the world's third-longest barrier reef, set amongst the Out Islands. At nearly 6,000 sq km (2,300 sq miles), it is also the largest island in the Bahamas. Whether you snorkel, hike or fish, visitors will delight in this untouched gem.",caribbean,,
costa rica,"Steaming rainforest, iridescent hummingbirds, smouldering volcanoes, tumbling rivers, and miles of palm-fringed sandy beaches: if Mother Nature can ever be accused of showing off, it is in Costa Rica. Sat just north of the equator, this verdant chunk of the Central American isthmus is one of the most bio-diverse spots on the planet. Added to this, as the only country in the region with no standing army, Costa Rica is a beacon of peace and democracy.      A world pioneer in eco-tourism, Costa Rica has set aside more than a quarter of its territory as a protected natural area. Its 28 national parks are its greatest glory, comprising a stunning variety of landscapes, microclimates, flora and fauna. The forest canopy at Los Quetzales National Park is the haunt of the colourful resplendent quetzal (Pharomachrus mocinno), the sacred bird of the ancient Mayans and Aztecs. The Las Baulas National Marine Park is home to the world's largest nesting ground of leatherback turtles. The Rincón de la Vieja Volcano National Park is alive with bubbling fumaroles and commanding waterfalls, making it a fantastic place to enjoy hiking, horseback riding, or simply having a soak in hot springs to soothe body aches.      Alternatively, if you are looking for an adrenalin kick, diving, surfing, rock climbing, whitewater rafting and tree-top ziplining are just a few of the extreme activities on offer. You can also hike around the country – choose from easy countryside rambles to epic coast-to-coast hike that takes you from the Caribbean side to the Pacific coast.      Costa Rica's cities may not win many architectural awards but they do offer a rich insight into the urban lives of Ticos, as the citizens call themselves. The capital, San José, has superb museums, specialty coffee shops and craft beer bars, while Puerto Limón, overlooking the Caribbean Sea, has a multi-ethnic flavour. Limón is also a popular stopover with surfers en-route to the big waves at Salsa Brava.      All in all, for those in search of an ethical adventure, Costa Rica's charms will have you under its spell all too quickly.","Costa Rica  Attractions in Costa Rica  Canopy tours  Born in the 90s in Costa Rica, canopy ziplining tours offer visitors a chance to glide above tree-tops and enjoy the up-close views of wildlife, including birds and monkeys. Tours are available in several locations, and some of the best places to experience a zipline thrill are Arenal, Braulio Carrillo and Monteverde. For those who prefer a gentler pursuit, try the Treetop Walk in Monteverde.  Eco-tourism  Costa Ricans like to point out that sustainability isn't just a practice, but a way of life. Apart from preserving some 25% of its natural treasure, the country also produces nearly 93% of its electricity from renewable sources and has various programmes measuring the level of sustainability within the tourism industry.  Flora and fauna  Covering just 51,100km² (19,730mi²), Costa Rica is a relatively small country, but it is bursting with wildlife at every turn, offering 234.8 plant species, 16.9 bird species and 4.6 mammal species per 1,000km² (386mi²). All in all, it packs nearly half a million species, representing 5% of the earth's biodiversity, within its borders.  Guayabo National Monument  Near Turrialba in the Central Valley, Guayabo is Costa Rica's most important archaeological site, populated by indigenous groups between 300 BCE and 1400 AD. The highlights include a 700-year old aqueduct, a stone walkway and several circular mounds said to be supporting conical structures in the past.  National Parks  Costa Rica's 28 national parks are the country's greatest glory, holding about 5% of the world's biodiversity. Each park offers something unique, from lofty volcanoes to white-sand beaches and extraordinary natural habitats for nearly half a million species. It is comforting to know that the country's natural wonders are never far away.  Rural tourism  Aiming to provide an authentic experience, rural tourism allows visitors to discover 'Pura Vida', referring to a simple, peaceful lifestyle that focuses on customs, traditions, and relationships while immersing in the country's natural diversity.  San José  San José, Costa Rica's vibrant capital city, lies in the Central Valley. It has fascinating museums, among them the Pre-Columbian Gold Museum, Jade Museum, and the National Museum are highly revered. Its bustling Central Market (Mercado Central) has over 200 stalls selling everything from cowboy boots to local bounty.  The Caribbean side  The Caribbean side of Costa Rica stretches from the San Juan River to the Sixaola River along the Panamanian border. The area is blessed with 322km (200mi) of coastline, including the beaches of the Tortuguero National Park, recognised for being the largest nesting ground of green turtles. Nearby, the Barra del Colorado Wildlife Refuge is home to many animals, including sloths, monkeys and crocodiles, while its many rivers and lagoons are known for sportfishing.  The Pacific side  Divided into several sections, Costa Rica's Pacific coast is packed with many riches, from must-see natural wonders to arguably the world's most beautiful beaches. Guanacaste, the northern section, is revered for its seaside towns, while the South Pacific coast, specifically its massive Corcovado National Park, is said to be the world's biologically richest place.  Volcanoes  As part of the Pacific Ring of Fire, Costa Rica is sprinkled with volcanoes, including five active ones. Volcanoes, most of which and their surrounding areas have been into national parks, attract thousands of visitors each year. For those who are interested, there are three volcanic ranges: the Guanacaste Range in the northwest, the Central Volcanic Range, and the Talamanca Range in the southeast.  Whitewater rafting  Costa Rica has some thrillingly turbulent rivers, where whitewater rafters take the plunge through the rapids. Two of the country's best rivers for rafting are the Reventazón and Pacuare. The latter is where many rafters enjoy a two-day trip in which they camp, swim, and check out toucans, sloths and monkeys in the surrounding rainforest.",north america,,
south dakota,"Shhh, don’t tell anyone, but South Dakota is something of a Midwest secret. A land of windswept prairies, pioneer towns, dramatic badlands and four gigantic presidents, the state has much to offer – but it doesn’t like to shout about it.      The Black Hills are South Dakota’s crowning glory, boasting a cluster of national parks, monuments and memorials. The most famous among them is Mount Rushmore National Memorial, where the faces of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln have been blasted and carved out of the mountain.      Equally curious is the Crazy Horse Memorial, which will be the world's largest mountain sculpture when completed. The 22-storey statue features Crazy Horse – a Native American war leader – riding a stallion and pointing into the distance. Work began in 1948 and the finish date is unknown.      If you want to shake off snap-happy tour groups, then trek among stripy canyons, spires and ragged buttes in Badlands National Park, home to bison, bighorn sheep and prairie dogs (alive and well), as well as sabre-toothed cats, ancient rhinos and three-toed horses (dead and fossilised).      Duck beneath the prairie and admire the intricate honeycomb formations in Wind Cave, one of the world’s longest caves. Or get a feel for US-Soviet Cold War tensions at Minuteman Missile, where a flick of a switch could have launched WWIII.      Slicing through the middle of the state, the Missouri River lures hikers, bikers, kayakers and anglers, who hook walleye, pike and perch. South Dakota is a big hunting spot too. Book a table in Sioux Falls, the state’s largest city, and gourmet game is likely to top the menu.","South Dakota  Attractions in South Dakota  Badlands National Park  Marvel at the scenery of Badlands National Park (www.nps.gov/badl), 98,785 hectares (244,000 acres) of striking rock formations including steep canyons, jagged spires, bands of colourful rocks and mixed-grass prairies. Camping grounds and cabins are available to visitors.

pakistan,"From the ancient Mughal city of Lahore to the snow-capped peaks of the Karakoram Mountains, Pakistan is a diverse nation defined not just by its natural beauty and architectural splendours, but by its friendly inhabitants, varied wildlife and rich culinary traditions.      Shame then, that political instability and sectarian violence has made large parts of the country a no-go for tourists, and prevented Pakistan from realising its potential as a top travel destination.      However, those daring enough to take a punt on Pakistan will be richly rewarded for their endeavours – particularly those with a penchant for the great outdoors. The North-West Frontier Province and Gilgit-Baltistan region are home to some of the world’s most famous mountain ranges, including Himalaya, Karakoram and Hindu Kush.      That explorers will have these sights more or less to themselves is another boon; gone are the well-marked routes and tea houses of India and Nepal, here lies real adventure.      From jaw-dropping mountain scenery to bustling conurbations, Pakistan’s vibrant cities each have their own distinct flavour. The super-sleek capital, Islamabad, is a modern metropolis bristling with contemporary architecture, world-class cultural attractions and some of the country’s finest restaurants.      Lahore is the very antithesis to Islamabad. Pakistan’s cultural capital, this ancient city abounds with UNESCO listed attractions, stunning shrines and ornate Mughal architecture. Its old town is a maze of bustling bazaars, which harbour mosques, museums and manicured gardens.      Karachi, the former capital and the economic powerhouse of the country, is a mega-city in every sense of the word, cramming 15 million or so into its boundaries. Meanwhile, Peshawar, in the North-West Frontier Province, remains a frontier town, sometimes dangerous and always intriguing.      Those seeking sun and seclusion, should explore Pakistan’s glorious coastline, which is home to some of the most pristine, crowd-free beaches in South Asia. While those looking to evoke the spirit a Kipling-style adventure should follow the ancient trade routes of the Khyber Pass, Grand Trunk Road and Karakoram Highway.     All of this and more lies in Pakistan, and all remains accessible to the more adventurous tourist.","Pakistan  Attractions in Pakistan  Drive on the world's highest highway  The Karakoram Highway is the world's highest paved road, reaching an elevation of 4,693m (15,397ft) as it meanders through the Himalaya, Hindu Kush and Pamir mountain ranges. Following the ancient Silk Road through breath-taking scenery, the highway offers views over the Indus River and of the beautiful Gilgit and Hunza valleys.  Explore Pakistan’s modern capital  With its cutting-edge architecture, leafy parks and world-class cultural sites, Islamabad is a modern metropolis that likes to surprise. Viewed best from Daman-e-Koh – a terraced garden with excellent panoramas over the city – Islamabad is home to some extraordinary sights, not least the magnificent Faisal Masjid, one of the most unusual looking mosques in all of Asia. The Pakistan Museum of Natural History, Lok Virsa Museum and National Gallery of Pakistan also warrant a visit. The latter is home to an impressive four-storey art gallery and a 400-seat auditorium.  Feast your eyes on Lahore  The capital of Pakistan's Punjab province, Lahore is home to some of the country's finest architecture. Must see sights include the UNESCO listed Shalimar Gardens and the magnificent Badshahi Mosque, which is a beautiful example of Mughal architecture rivalled only by the Taj Mahal. Other must see sights include the Gate of Chauburji, Mughal Jahangir's tomb and Gawalmandi Food Street, which serves some of the finest fare in the land.  Follow the iconic Khyber Pass  Travellers are currently not advised to visit the Khyber Pass. Readers have reported lately that they were refused a permit to travel along this iconic route, due to on-going security fears along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Those who are successful will experience the madness of this dusty trade route, where thousands of brightly coloured trucks jostle for space on what used to be part of the Silk Road.  Go on a pilgrimage to Ziarat  The beautiful city of Ziarat is located amongst juniper forests in the province of Baluchistan. Aside from the scenery, the most famous attraction here is Ziarat Residency, the wooded house where Pakistan's founder, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, spent his final days. Another popular pilgrimage site is the shrine of Baba Kharwari – a disciple of Indian revolutionary, Nana Saheb – who has been attributed with causing a number of miracles.  Hit the slopes at Malam Jabba  Blown up by the Taliban in 2006, Pakistan's Malam Jabba ski resort reopened in 2011 – and now it's better than ever. Perched some 2,804m (9,200ft) up in the Karakoram mountain range, Malam Jabba is equipped with state-of-the-art facilities and plans are afoot for a new hotel, cable car and piste.  Kick back in cosmopolitan Karachi  Situated on the shores of the Arabian Sea, Karachi is Pakistan's former capital and its largest city. The bustling port is home to the magnificent Quaid-e-Azam's Mazar, the mausoleum of the founder of Pakistan, which is made exclusively out of white marble. Other places of interest include the National Museum of Pakistan, Port Grand, Sadaar Bazaar and Clifton Beach; Karachi's answer to Venice Beach. A good spot for people watching, visitors can also ride camels and eat the local speciality – roasted corn on the cob.  Learn about Buddhism at the Taxila Museum  This museum has an extraordinary collection of art from the ancient kingdom of Gandharan, which incorporated modern day northern Pakistan and Afghanistan. The Kingdom of Gandharan (1500-500 BC) was a centre of Buddhist and Hindu culture and the museum showcases many fine exhibits from this period including temple friezes, Buddhist sculptures and ancient coins.  Marvel at Mohatta Palace Museum  In 1927, Shiv Rattan Mohatta, a successful Marwari entrepreneur, commissioned a palatial house in the affluent seaside neighbourhood of Clifton, Karachi. Mohatta made his fortune as a ship handler and enlisted the services of Ahmed Hussein Agha, one of the first Muslim architects of India. Today his palace has been converted into the Mohatta Palace Museum.  Peek at Pakistan’s peaks  Pakistan contains five of the world's highest peaks and several of the world's largest glaciers. The northern areas are the most popular for trekking, with Gilgit and Skardu being good starting points for trips. Those visiting Kashmir can see some of the highest mountains in the world, including the famous Nanga Parbat and the second-highest mountain in the world, K2. The Baltoro Glacier and the Batura Glacier are the largest outside the polar regions.  Roam the ruins of Mohenjo-Daro  Dating back to 2600 BC, Mohenjo-Daro is a fascinating, albeit somewhat dusty, archaeology site in Sindh province. Home to one of the world's first major settlements before it was abandoned in the 19th century, today only ruins remain and they are in a poor state – this UNESCO World Heritage Site is suffering the effects of erosion and poor maintenance. Despite that, it's still worth a visit.  Roam yet more ruins at Takht-i-Bahi  Another UNESCO World Heritage Site, the beautiful Buddhists monastic complex of Takht-i-Bahi is located approximately 80km (49 miles) from Peshawar in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Constructed in the 1st century BC, Takht-i-Bahi is the most complete Buddhist monastery in Pakistan.  Stimulate your senses at Anarkali Bazaar  One of the oldest bazaars in Asia, Anarkali is a place that will awaken your senses. Listen to the tinkle of glass bangles, feel the fine silk wares and smell the spices wafting from the traditional food stalls. And don't forget to tuck into the famous chaat of Anarkali Bazaar – the reason why many school children make a detour here on their way home.  Take in the Chitral Valley  Sitting in the shadow of the Hindu Kush, is Chitral Valley. A wild and beautiful place, most visitors to this rugged region base themselves in Chitral, a laidback, welcoming town that feels quite different to the rest of Pakistan. Chitral is also conveniently located for a visit to the Kalash Valleys, where the Kalash people, the last of the non-Islamic tribes of Kafiristan, live. This valley is noted for its hot springs and trout-filled rivers.  Visit Qila Bala Hisar fort in Peshawar  The ancient city of Peshawar is often overlooked due to on-going problems in the region. However, those travelling to this dusty metropolis will be rewarded for their perseverance by the magnificent sight of Qila Bala Hisar fort, which was used by King Timur Shah Durrani (1773-1793) as the winter capital of the Afghan Durrani Empire. The fort can be found in the old town, which is characterised by ubiquitous donkey carts, ancient bazaars and traditional Mughal architecture.  Watch a traditional polo match  Polo is a popular sport in the northern towns of Gilgit and Chitral, where they play a wild form of the traditional game: pomp and snobbery is replaced by live music and a lot of bravado from the crowd. The first game of the season tends to be after the Spring Festival, towards the end of March.",asia,,

Kings Canyon is the deepest canyon in the USA. Joshua Tree National Park was named as a National Monument in 1936. The Park is 234,000 acres of protected wilderness with a variety of hiking trails for beginners and experts, campgrounds, two deserts, and mountain ranges. Geologists believe the area is over a million years old. Joshua Trees themselves are giant members of the lily family. Bobcats, coyotes, and roadrunners call the park home.  Beaches  La Jolla is one of San Diego’s best and most popular beaches. Somewhat protected from the prevailing southwest wind, it's a safe, gentle spot to learn or enjoy surfing.

mali,"With a history blighted by political instability, it's hardly surprising that Mali is missing from most people’s bucket lists. But as peace slowly returns to this dusty land, travellers are trickling back to unearth the country’s cultural treasures – of which there are many.      Though it’s hard to see how one of the most remote nations in the world, located deep within the Sahara Desert, ever became a centre of world learning, Timbuktu is not only a byword for long distances, but also an internationally recognised centre of knowledge: its libraries contain seminal notes on astronomy, mathematics and philosophy dating back to the 16th century.      Closely linked to Timbuktu by the Saharan trade in gold, salt and slaves, Djenné is known the world over for its adobe architecture, in particular the Grand Mosque, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the largest mud-brick building in the world.      Bamako, Mali’s capital, may not have the cultural attractions of Timbuktu or Djenné, but it has a fascinating collection of architectural styles and an elegant location on the banks of the River Niger. What’s more, it is the centre of the country’s traditional music scene and Malians of all ethnicities throng to the nightclubs of Bamako to dance the night away to the sound of the kora, a lute-like instrument.      The most distinct of Mali’s people are the Dogon, whose secluded, cliff-side villages cling to sheer rock faces. Deliberately isolating themselves from the influences of neighbouring tribes they have developed a culture with no similarity in the region.      A land of faraway cities, intriguing civilisations and architecture like nowhere else on Earth, Mali’s position as a cultural juggernaut is well founded and its tentative steps towards stability have opened up an avenue of discovery for intrepid travellers.","Mali  Attractions in Mali  Admire the traditional architecture of Djenné  Often considered the 'Jewel of the Niger', Djenné is home to the world's largest mud-brick building, the Grande Mosquée. Almost every building in town follows the same traditional adobe architecture. About 5km (3 miles) to the south is the archaeological site of Djenné-Djeno (Old Djenné), founded around 250BC and one of the oldest towns in sub-Saharan Africa.  Explore Gao’s traditional architecture  An important town on the trans-Saharan trade routes, Gao had its heyday in the 15th century when it was capital of the Songhai Empire. The mosque of Musa I (considered the richest man who has ever lived) and the tomb of Askia, both traditional Sahelian mud-brick structures, can be found here.  Go on safari at Boucle de Baoulé National Park  With a number of permanent water sources Boucle de Baoulé National Park permits an array of southern Sahelian species to thrive even during the dry season. Giraffe, leopard, lion, elephant, buffalo and hippo are all present in the park. Mostly comprising a savannah landscape, this natural wonder is also known for its prehistoric tombs and rock art.  Marvel at Mount Hombori  Located close to Mopti, flat-topped Mount Hombori is not only Mali's tallest mountain at just over 1,150m (3,800 feet), but also an important ecological and archaeological site. Its steep sides have protected its flora and fauna from degradation and its caves have been inhabited for more than 2000 years.  Reach the fabled city of Timbuktu  The city of Timbuktu, straddling ancient trans-Saharan caravan routes, remains the centre of a lucrative trade in salt and gold that dates back centuries, as well as being an important centre of Islamic learning. The Tuareg presence gives the city an Arabic feel that contrasts Mali's other cities, and many historic mosques and tombs remain.  Sit by the Niger at Mopti  Located at the confluence of the Bani and the Niger rivers, Mopti is built on three islands joined by raised causeways. The mud-brick Grand Mosque is a good example of Sahelian architecture. The town's central market, Marché des Souvenirs, and the area surrounding the port are also worth visiting.  Swing by Ségou  Located on the banks of the River Niger, Ségou is known for its pottery and the production of bogolan cloth, dyed using fermented mud. The nearby village of Ségou-Koro (Old Ségou), lying 10km (6 miles) upstream, became the capital of the Bambara Empire in the 17th century, and was visited by explorer Mungo Park in 1796.  Take in the capital’s culture  Mali's capital, Bamako, is a modern-looking city on the River Niger and the educational and cultural centre of the country. Not to be missed are its markets, the botanical gardens, the Musée National and the craft centre at the Maison des Artisans. The nearby Point G Hill houses prehistoric cave paintings and offers great views of Bamako below.  Trek Dogon country  A trek between the traditional villages of the Bandiagara escarpment, which are cut into pink sandstone cliffs, offers exquisite views. Inhabited by the Dogon, whose ancient beliefs have remained largely untouched by Islam, the unique architectural style of these villages has helped them become listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site.  Watch sunset over La Dune Rose  A short distance from Gao, La Dune Rose lies on the right bank of the Niger. Come sunset, Koïma – as it is known locally – turns a wondrous pink. To take maximum advantage of the atmosphere, head upstream to Quema and Hondo, where the sunset ignites similar colours on more dunes.",africa,,
chad,"From the natural wonders of the Sahara Desert and Lake Chad to the tribal culture and hospitality that flourishes across the country, Chad quietly gets on with creating unforgettable experiences, while the rest of the world looks on unaware.      With a predominantly rural population, urban life is restricted to N’Djamena, the capital. As Chad’s commercial hub it attracts people from over 200 different ethnic groups. The result is a diverse set of social structures rubbing alongside one another and stark contrasts between the capital’s modernist heart and the ancient ways of nomadic tribespeople such as the Tuareg and Toubou.      Ethnicity remains far more important than Chadian identity and tribes hold dear a rich cultural heritage that remains largely unchanged by time or the outside world.      Chad’s prehistoric cave paintings, found amid gnarled rock formations in the Sahara Desert, document the existence of large animals in the region for millennia, so it is therefore unsurprising that even today the country is home to some of Africa’s most iconic species, including elephant, rhino, giraffe, leopard and lion.      Birdsong, made all the sweeter by the desert landscape, is near constant in the hidden palm-fringed oases of the Sahara, while the clear blue waters of Lake Chad form the second largest wetland in Africa and an important source of water for not only birds but reptiles and larger mammals too.      Whether it is to experience the solitude of the Sahara, seek out the hospitality of the Tuareg or witness animals surviving in the one of the most extreme landscapes on Earth, Chad offers hardy travellers an extraordinary experience. It may be nicknamed the “dead heart of Africa,” but as anyone who knows this country will tell you, that moniker couldn’t be further from the truth.","Chad  Attractions in Chad  Admire the artefacts at the National Museum  Housed in a purpose-built structure on the edge of the city, the National Museum at N'Djaména features a range of fine collections, which explore everything from folk art and to the traditions of the country's people. Outside stands an elegant modern sculpture of a tribesperson with the world in the palm of their hand.  Head to the camel races  Catch a glimpse of some of the best camel racing in the world in the Tibesti Mountains, home of the fierce Toubou tribe. This astonishing Saharan region of chasms and crags contains palm-fringed oases, ancient rock art, hot springs, and Emi Koussi, the country's highest peak, at 3,450m (11,300ft).  Marvel at an inland sea  Lake Chad must be seen to be believed. Not only was the lake the centre of Africa's lucrative salt trade, but it is also one of the largest fresh water lakes in the world. It is best visited between August and December, when the water level is highest and the occasional hippo or crocodile can be seen drifting by. Though spectacular, there are fears for Lake Chad, which has shrunk dramatically over the last 30 years due to climate change and the demands of agriculture.  Quaff cold beers on a brewery tour  Take a glug of cold beer at the Gala Brewery in Moundou, Chad's second largest city. Produced since independence, it is the country's most popular lager, with over one million barrels produced each year. Located in Chad's far south, Moundou is also home to the Ngambai people.  Relax in Douguia  With its beautiful location on the Chari River, Douguia was designed as a tourist centre and has indeed become something of a hotspot. Boatman take visitors out on the water in traditional pirogue canoes to explore the region, witnessing the everyday lives of locals, large flocks of birds, and hippos.  See the coloured lakes of Ounianga  A UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2012, the lakes of Ounianga are a series of 18 interconnected lakes that help form a surreal waterscape within the depths of the Sahara Desert. The colours can be astonishing, with the lake waters ranging from blue and green to red as a result of their varying chemical compositions.  Trek to Guelta d’Archei  Located in the striking Ennedi Plateau in Chad's northeast, the Guelta d'Archei is a long-used desert waterhole vital for the survival of a number of species in the area. The small population of Nile crocodile that remain here is probably the last in the Sahara.  Visit the ancient city of Abéché  A former capital of the powerful Ouadaï sultanate, Abéché has retained much of its ancient charm. The old city and its somewhat rundown sultan's palace, mosques and dynastic tombs remain behind a protective wall, while the cobbled streets are walked by nomadic tribespeople visiting from the surrounding desert.  Wander N'Djaména's distinctive quarters  Chad's capital is slowly regaining its reputation as one of Central Africa's liveliest cities. The historic quarter, with its colourful daily market, is fascinating place to examine Chadian rugs and jewellery up close. The Arab quarter remains understated and quiet at night, while the African quarter is alive with bars.  Witness Chad’s wildlife at Zakouma National Park  Zakouma National Park is located on an immense plain, across which the Bahr Salamat River and its tributaries flow from north to south. Refurbished and restocked with wildlife, visitors can see herds of elephant, as well as giraffe and lion, either on game drives or on ranger-guided walks.",africa,,
papua new guinea,"Papua New Guinea is a fascinating country where travellers can explore remote villages, as well as enjoying spectacular diving, stunning wildlife, scenic surfing and myriad cultures. The tribal diversity of a country with over 800 languages and 600 islands cannot easily be summarised, although in Papua New Guinea it is the tribal life that is most fascinating to the visitor.  Beyond the dizzying array of ethnic groups to get to know, there are many unique attractions, excursions and activities on offer, from discovering wrecks of World War II aircraft that lie in the jungle, to peeking inside the sacred wooden haustambarans (spirit houses) of towns and villages in the country.  One of the largest draws for those visiting Papua New Guinea is the country's extensive wildlife and unique ecosystem. From the mountainous highlands to the Evian-blue waters, travellers can expect to discover weird and wonderful creatures, from tree-climbing kangaroos to spectacular birds of paradise; there are almost 700 bird species on the islands. Be sure to visit the National Botanic Gardens in Port Moresby, which is probably the capital's greenest, most beautiful sport. Most of the country remains undeveloped, with the largest island of Bouganville avoiding from resort hotels and commercialisation – ideal for the independent traveller.  Above all, though, it's the inhabitants that make Papua New Guinea truly unique. Many of the hundreds of languages spoken here are kept alive by a just a few dozen people. Each ethnic group has its own proud artistic traditions, with deft handicrafts, entrancing dance performances and bracing music. If you happen to visit during a festival – to be fair, there are many of them occurring throughout the year – prepare to be spellbound by tribal concerts and elaborate headdresses. Spend a bit of time here, and you'll feel as if you've gained access to a bygone era, although it would be wrong to describe the inhabitants as stuck in the past. Anyone welcomed into their embrace will say that they are thriving.","Papua New Guinea  Attractions in Papua New Guinea  Explore the Eastern Highlands  Rugged mountains and verdant valleys characterise the Eastern Highlands, making it popular with hikers. But it's not just about nature: the region is a fine place to explore Papua New Guinean heritage. Bena Village, near Goroka, is a sight to behold with its megalithic ruins and thatched houses, which are decorated with human skulls. Then there's Asaro, where men coat themselves with mud and re-enact their historic revenge on a neighbouring village.  Go scuba diving  Make the most of spectacular swimming, snorkelling and diving opportunities off the beautiful beaches of Papua New Guinea. From wrecks to reefs, Madang, Port Moresby and Rabaul offer a wide variety of dive sites. Diving excursions can also be arranged at Loloaka, Milne Bay and off the island of New Britain, where some of the region's finest sites can be found.  Kick back in the capital, Port Moresby  The Papua New Guinean capital nestles on Fairfax Harbour and is one of the least liveable cities in the world, according to The Economist. Don't let that put you off, though. Port Moresby has a fair share of attractions including the National Parliament, the National Museum, the Botanical Gardens and the Catholic Cathedral, built in the style of a traditional haus tambaran (meetinghouse). Nevertheless, most use it as gateway to the rest of the country.  Marvel at Madang  Once described as the ""prettiest town in the South Pacific,"" Madang is a popular launching pad for travellers looking to explore Papua New Guinea's extraordinary underwater world. As well as being a gateway to reefs, wrecks and crystalline waters, Madang has a variety of shops and markets, where local crafts can be bought. The scenery is also unremittingly beautiful.  Shop for crafts in Kanganaman  Visit Kanganaman, a traditional Papa New Guinean village, where carvers of exceptional talent whittle wood into elaborate masks, totems and figurines. The village is also home to a beautiful haus tambaran (meetinghouse), which is perhaps one of the finest examples of such a building in the country.  Soak up the scenery of the Mendi Valley  For a hair-raising experience with spectacular scenery, take a trip to the Mendi Valley in the Southern Highlands, also known for its limestone caves and sheer rock faces. It is also home to the Huli wigmen, who decorate themselves with face paint and elaborate wigs made of human hair.  Spot birds-of-paradise  Witness the beauty of the famous birds-of-paradise at Baiyer River Wildlife Sanctuary in the Western Highlands. Located 55km (34 miles) north of Mount Hagen, this beautiful nature reserve is also home to possums, tree kangaroos, parrots, cassowaries and bandicoots. The area boasts some great trekking opportunities.  Take a hike on the Kokoda Trail  Starting just outside Port Moresby, the Kokoda Trail offers magnificent views as it wends through ravines, rainforests and rubber plantations. The 96km (60-mile) route is not for the fainthearted: hikers must endure extreme humidity, mosquitoes and torrential rail. Other places of interest include the Wairiata National Park, Moitaka Crocodile Farm and Loloata Island.  Trek through Chambri  Take a river or jungle tour in the Chambri region, stopping at remote villages where houses are built on stilts, and the dugout canoe is still the main means of transport. Hear villagers play slit drums and see elaborate local carvings.  Wake early for birdwatching  Pack your binoculars and head to Chambri Lakes, which are home to myriad species from brahminy kites to kingfishers. Go on an early morning jungle excursion to experience a wonderful cacophony of bird song, which brings in the new day.  While away the day in Lae Botanical Gardens  Stroll through the beautiful botanical gardens in Lae, a verdant oasis in the capital of Morobe Province. The grounds are home to roughly 2,000 different plant species and are crisscrossed by various creeks. Adjacent to the botanical gardens is the Lae War Cemetery, which holds the remains of some 2,800 soldiers who gave their lives in WWII.",oceania,,
bulgaria,"Bulgaria's spectacular mountains, golden beaches and vibrant cities have begun attracting hordes of eager-eyed tourists over the past few years. As a result, beautiful ski and beach resorts are expanding quickly.      The main cities have shrugged off the weary Communist-era image and have become vibrant and attractive, with a string of cultural attractions, varied shopping and lively nightlife keeping visitors entertained. In contrast, many towns and villages have preserved the authentic Bulgarian spirit and hospitality -  the country is especially proud of its rich folklore traditions.      Hikers will find a variety of mountain ranges covering much of the country, with plenty of extraordinary wildlife to be glimpsed along the way. The walking trails are well mapped, taking hikers through forests, past lakes and waterfalls, with the chance to spot bears, wolves and lynx.  Those keen on caving and kayaking will also find plenty to entertain them, while skiing and snowshoeing are also popular here.      Of course, the attraction that brings most visitors to Bulgaria is its remarkably unspoiled beaches strewn along the Black Sea coast. Less-visited, less-developed and with lots of facilities for water sports, Bulgaria's sandy beaches are the equal to almost any of the more popular coastal spots in the Mediterranean. What's more, you'll find many aged seaside towns complete with cobbled streets and historic buildings.      Bulgaria is home to seven UNESCO World Heritage cultural sites including:    • Ancient city of Nessebar, a 3,000-year-old site which was originally a Thracian settlement and became a Greek colony in the 6th century.    • Boyana Church, a medieval Bulgarian Orthodox church on the outskirts of Sofia.    • Madara Rider, a large rock relief depicting a knight triumphing over a lion in Madara.    • Rila Monastery, the largest and most famous Eastern Orthodox monastery in Bulgaria.    • Rock-hewn churches of Ivanovo, a series of chapels, churches and monasteries within the Rusenski Lom Nature Park.    • Thracian tomb of Kazanlak, a richly decorated burial chamber from the Hellenistic period.    • Thracian tomb of Sveshtari, an amazing historical site reflecting the fundamental structural principles of Thracian cult buildings.      In addition, Bulgaria also has three natural sites that are also UNESCO-listed including ancient and primeval beech forest of the Carpathians, Pirin National Park and Srebarna Nature Reserve.","Bulgaria  Attractions in Bulgaria  Belogradchik  Explore the age-old town of Belogradchik, nestled in the foothills of the Balkan Mountains in northwest Bulgaria, near the Serbian border.

Rila Monastery  Be fascinated by the vast collection of murals, woodcarvings, old weapons and bibles written on parchment at Rila Monastery, 121km (75 miles) from Sofia. Fire has destroyed most of the early 10th-century architecture, and the present buildings date from the 19th century, with the exception of the 14th-century Khrelio's Tower.  Ski the slopes  Skiing in Bulgaria is considerably cheaper than other popular resorts in Western Europe. The best-developed ski resorts are Bansko, Borovets and Pamporovo.  Sofia  Discover different architectural styles from Greek, Roman, Byzantine to Ottoman in Sofia. The capital of Bulgaria boasts a string of museums, monuments, churches, art galleries and opera houses. The stunning gold-leaf domed Alexander Nevski Cathedral is the most famous sight. Visit the Sofia travel guide for more information.  The Rose Valley of Kazanlak  For centuries Bulgarians have planted roses in an area known as the Rose Valley (a narrow band in the centre of the country), and extracted their heavenly essence - attar of roses. The Rose Valley is magically transformed with breathtaking blooms in May and early June each year when The Festival of Roses is celebrated in many towns of the region.  Trigrad Gorge  Spectacular Trigrad Gorge is in the Rhodope Mountains close to the town of Trigrad in Southern Bulgaria, and is flanked by vertical marble rocks rising to 300m (980ft). It is a popular place for hiking, biking, birdwatching and fishing. The Devil’s Throat Cave is a popular tourist destination with water from the Trigrad River feeding huge waterfalls down its 'throat', before cascading 42m (138ft) down into the abyss below.

seychelles,"Clichéd or not, the islands of Seychelles are about as close to paradise as you can get: once you have felt the sand between your toes and paddled in the crystal clear waters here, beach holidays will never be the same again.      Made up of 115 topical islands in all, the Seychelles archipelago is a destination where white, sandy beaches are as pure as the driven snow; where frothy turquoise waters harbour colourful coral reefs and bountiful marine life; where secret coves allow you to have your very own Robinson Crusoe moment with only birds and tortoises for company.      Mahé may be the biggest and the busiest of all the islands, but it has its fair share of secluded bays, which are accessible only by yacht, motorboat or on foot. Together with its sisters Praslin and La Digue, it attracts a constant surge of tourists.      More adventurous travellers, on the other hand, may prefer to take a flying boat to more remote islands such as Fregate or Bird Island and enjoy secluded beaches all to themselves. These islands are especially popular with birdwatchers and nature lovers due to their abundance of wildlife.      The absence of people on many of the islands means that rare plant life has thrived throughout this Indian Ocean archipelago. Tropical life abounds below the waves too, and is best viewed by going scuba diving or snorkelling, experiences which are made all the more memorable here thanks to the crystalline seas.      Seychelles is more than just a natural sanctuary, though. The country is a veritable melting pot of cultures: its inhabitants descend from African, Asian and European immigrants, who have brought their customs and traditions with them to the islands. This heady mix is particularly pleasing on the palate thanks to the archipelago's fabulous fusion food.      Seychelles is an extraordinarily alluring destination, and one that's guaranteed to whet your appetite for a return trip – assuming your bank balance can handle it.","Seychelles  Attractions in Seychelles  Aldabra: get close to giant tortoises  Aldabra, the world's second largest coral atoll and a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is home to more than 150,000 giant tortoises. To visit Aldabra, you must first get a permit from the Seychelles Islands Foundation, then you can either hire a private yacht or take a bi-monthly supply boat that is managed by the Island Development Company to Aldabra.  Birdwatching in Seychelles  With 238 species recorded, Seychelles offers fantastic birding opportunities throughout the year, though the period between October to mid-December is often considered the best. The islands of Aride, Bird and Cousin are some of the best places for birdwatching.  Denis Island: big game fishing  With excellent conditions for big game fishing, Denis Island attracts budding and professional fishermen who are after Blue Marlin, Yellow Fin Tuna, Bonito, Barracuda, to name but a few. While you can fish year-round, June to September will see charter prices rise. Apart from Denis, you can also try other outer islands including Alphonse, Bird, Desroches and Poivre.  Frégate: feel like a castaway  Frégate Island Private, the most easterly and isolated of the granitic islands, is home to the almost extinct magpie robin, 3,000 free-roaming Giant Aldabra Tortoises and the biggest flora nursery in Seychelles. The conservation project is funded by visitors who rent one of the 16 ultra-luxury villas or even the entire island.  La Digue: Anse Source d’Argent and L’Union  Featured in countless advertisements, Anse Source d’Argent is perhaps the most famous beach on La Digue. Just a short distance north of Anse Source d'Argent is the L'Union Estate Farm. Take a bicycle ride through the farm and check out the traditional copra mill, the old boatyard, cemetery of the first settlers, and see the giant tortoise in front of the granite boulders. A little further up north from the farm lies the Veuve Nature Reserve, home to the endangered Seychelles Paradise Flycatcher.  Mahé: natural and cultural highlights  The largest island in the Seychelles archipelago has plenty of stunning beaches which are often less crowded than the touristy islands of Praslin or La Digue. Other highlights include the vibrant Sir Selwyn Selwyn-Clarke Market, Victoria (for Creole architecture) and the Botanical Garden (which is also home to the Aldabra Giant tortoises).  Praslin: Anse Georgette and Anse Lazio  Fringed with large granite boulders, the power-white sandy Anse Lazio is another award-winning beach in the Seychelles that calls for kicking back and absorbing the panoramas. Just 7km (4 miles) away is another gorgeous beach called Anse Georgette – you need to book beach access with Constance Lemuria Resort in advance.      On Praslin, the UNESCO-listed Vallée de Mai Nature Reserve is also home to a palm forest, the habitat for endemic coco-de-mer.

Follow the humpback whales  Watch for whales in July to October, when humpback whales come to the waters around São Tomé. Dolphins are also a regular sight and can be seen at most times of the season. It's fairly simple to book yourself on a whale watching boat trip and follow the whales down the coast for about eight hours.  Have fun on the coast  The crystalline waters of São Tomé e Príncipe offer some of the best swimming, snorkelling and diving in West Africa. Beaches here have white and black sand and its seas are excellent for deep-sea fishing, particularly around Bom Bom Island.  Peer through the binoculars  If you like boobies, you'll love São Tomé (stop sniggering in the back) because the island is teeming with these seabirds. The coast is also home to flamingos and ospreys, but twitchers will fine even more colourful species in the rainforest, which is packed with plenty of endemic mammals, amphibians and plants, too.  Sleep the night on Ilheu Bom Bom island  Enjoy one of the country's few tourist resorts on the tiny island of Ilheu Bom Bom, situated off Príncipe's northern coast. The island is a popular haunt for holidaymakers looking to stay in the calming resorts of Sao Tome and Principe.  Take a stroll around São Tomé  Explore the island of São Tomé, representing 90% of the total surface of the country. The capital of the same name is a picturesque town, with colonial Portuguese architecture and attractive parks. It's worth bearing in mind that the wet season usually runs from October through to May.  Take a tour of Agostinho Neto  Visit the manyroças (cocoa plantations) on Agostinho Neto, which is the largest plantation in the country and is a clear example of São Tomé's colonial past. Other plantations include Agua Izé, where visitors can tour the estate by train, Monté Café and Ribeira Peixe.  Visit the historic town of São João dos Angolares  See the ancient fishing town of São João dos Angolares and the fortress of São Sebastião, which also houses a museum with a collection of religious and colonial art. The town takes its name from the Angolan slaves who settled in the region in the sixteenth century.",africa,,
northwest territories,"You’re more likely to spot a herd of bison or come across a grizzly bear than you are to encounter humans in the Northwest Territories. Everything is extreme here, from the isolation (it’s very remote) to the daylight (or lack of it) and the size of the wildlife (humongous).      Yellowknife, where most of the territories’ population and commercial activity is based, may not be much to write home about, but it’s the perfect launch pad for outdoor adventure.      Arrive in winter, and catch a glimpse of the Northern Lights. Watch the celestial spectacle from a luxury lodge or hunker down in a cosy teepee. Witness a 3,000-strong herd of reindeer cross the frozen Mackenzie River, and celebrate the end of winter with harpoon-throwing contests, dog sledding and skidoo races at Inuvik’s Muskrat Jamboree.      In the summer pay a visit to endangered whooping cranes at Wood Buffalo National Park and take a sightseeing flight over the park’s rare salt plains and free-roaming bison herds. Further north, the territories extend far beyond the Arctic Circle, well into polar bear territory. Don't forget to look up: the skies here contain some of the rarest bird species on the planet.      Road trips in the Northwest Territories are no Sunday afternoon drive. The Dempster Highway runs 454 miles (730km) from Dawson City, Yukon to Inuvik, and is open year-round come rain, shine, ice or snow.      The territories’ outdoor activities are many and varied. Anglers can hook lake trout that weigh more than their children. Kayakers can bounce through the Class IV Cassette Rapids on Slave River. Hikers can hit the remote Canol Heritage Trail through the Mackenzie Mountains. And the world’s leading mountaineers can tackle Nahanni National Park’s Cirque of the Unclimbables. With a name like that, how could they resist?","Northwest Territories  Attractions in Northwest Territories  Enjoy the simple life in a rural lodge  In a wooden wilderness lodge alongside a lake, accessible only by air, you may have only wildlife for company. For a real getaway experience, the Nahanni Mountain Lodge (www.simpson-air.com) sits alongside Little Doctor Lake, near Nahanni National Park Reserve.  Fall in love under the midnight sun  The landscape takes on a surreal quality during the midsummer when light lasts all night.  Glittering waterfalls  The Waterfalls Route, a 325km (203-mile) driving route, goes through several parks and past impressive waterfalls. Twin Falls Territorial Park, near Enterprise, has two waterfalls. Louise Falls and Alexandra Falls are linked by a 3km (1.9-mile) hiking trail along the spectacular Hay River Canyon.  Go fishing  Thousands of clear, unpolluted lakes are perfect for fishing. Chief catches are trout, great northern pike and grayling.  Historic waterways  You can hire a boat to take a trip on the Mackenzie River and the Great Slave and Great Bear Lakes. These tours often follow old trapping and fur-trading routes. An experienced guide is essential.  Meet caribou and moose  See thousands of caribou migrating across the territories and calving by the Beaufort Sea. Moose inhabit boreal forests, grizzly bears roam freely, Dall's sheep graze the mountains, and you might spot beluga whales and polar bears along the coastline.  Nahanni National Park Reserve  Nahanni National Park Reserve is a wonderful UNESCO World Heritage Site in the Mackenzie Mountains. Access is mainly by air from a number of locations, including Fort Simpson (NWT), Fort Liard (NWT), Fort Nelson (BC) or Watson Lake (Yukon). Boat and raft tours visit the magnificent 100m- (312ft-) high Virginia Falls, twice the height of Niagara.  National parks  One of Canada's biggest herds of free-roaming bison lives in Wood Buffalo National Park, one of the largest parks on earth. It lies on the border between Alberta and the Northwest Territories. Meanwhile, the cliffs and valleys of Tuktut Nogait, the territories' newest national park, harbour birds of prey and offer lush habitat for caribou and musk oxen.  Shoot in the wild  Visitors who take a camera with a macro lens may get beautiful photographs of the hosts of tiny wild flowers that cover the tundra area during its brief spring.  Take a dip in Canada's watersports scene  A favourite destination for canoeing and white-water rafting is the Nahanni River in the southern Mackenzie Mountains, featuring falls, rapids and torrents in a highland wilderness. Popular routes along its length take seven to 20 days to paddle. The Mackenzie River also offers good canoeing.  Visit the city of Yellowknife  The territories' capital, Yellowknife, is situated on the north shore of Great Slave Lake. The Prince of Wales Northern Heritage Centre details the area's aboriginal history. Nearby are the still largely traditional First Nations of Dettah, Behchokò, N'dilo and Wekweètì.  Walk the Northwest's hiking trails  Four national parks provide trails for hiking and other facilities. Sandy hills known as eskers offer easy hiking with good viewpoints. There's more challenging hiking on the Canol Heritage Trail, through mountains and valleys to the Yukon.  Wonder at the Arctic coastline  The Arctic coastline boasts spectacular landscapes and fascinating history. Inuvik, on the majestic Mackenzie River Delta, is accessible in season by road. Delta cruises and Dene (aboriginal) settlements such as Aklavik are prime attractions. Aulavik National Park, on Banks Island, has 3,500-year-old archaeological sites.",north america,canada,
montana,"Two stellar national parks, bountiful wildlife and super-friendly locals: make sure you book a return ticket to Montana, or you might be tempted to stay.      Straddling the US-Canadian border, Glacier National Park is the jewel in Montana’s crown. A land of mammoth mountains and ice-hewn valleys splashed with turquoise lakes, visitors can drive over the Continental Divide via the hair-raising Going-to-the-Sun Road, or choose from more than 1,100km (700 miles) of hiking trails, which crisscross the park. A classic route is the Highline Trail, where epic vistas and sightings of bighorn sheep, marmots and grizzly bears compensate for the vertigo.      Southwestern Montana is a gateway to another beauty: Yellowstone, the world’s first national park. The earth is alive here, with spewing geysers and bubbling hot springs simmering between mountains, rivers and canyons. Bison, elk, wolves and grizzlies roam this mesmerising landscape, which is worth visiting anytime of the year, particularly winter – hop on a snowmobile to see steaming thermal pools, snow ghosts and frost-mottled bison.      While you’re at it, bring your skis to one of Montana’s brilliant downhill resorts. Big Sky and Whitefish are up there with the best, but befriend the locals and they will reveal a clutch of smaller, low-key hills that most visitors miss.      There’s more to Montana than mountains, though. Head east to Montana’s High Plains, a region of buttes, prairies and meandering waterways. Follow the canoes of legendary explorers, Lewis and Clark, on a paddle through the Upper Missouri River Breaks National Monument or spot antelope, elk and 200 varieties of birds in the CM Russell National Wildlife Refuge. No wonder they call it the ‘Treasure State’.","Montana  Attractions in Montana  Great outdoors  Join canoeing classes and other outdoor activities offered by Montana State University in Billings, Montana's largest city. Great opportunities abound in the region for fishing, hiking and western adventures, such as guest ranches and cattle drives. Catch the Big SkyFest hot air balloon festival in late July/early August.  Helena  Tour Helena, the state capital, with its fine 19th-century architecture, museums and the gothic-style St Helena Cathedral (www.sthelenas.org), modelled on the cathedral in Cologne, Germany.  Historic tour  Retrace the path of Lewis and Clark's historic expedition (http://lewisandclark.state.mt.us) in the early 1800s that opened up the wealth of the western US.  Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument  Head for Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument, an hour southeast of Billings and site of General George Armstrong Custer's last stand against the Sioux and Cheyenne warriors on 25 June 1876. A tour takes visitors through the battle movements of both sides and the visitors' centre displays weapons used in the battle.  Montana Museum of the Rockies  Visit the Montana Museum of the Rockies (www.museumoftherockies.org) and sign the kids up for a week-long camp to learn about paleontology and go on a mock dinosaur dig.  National Bison Range  See bison, elk, deer, bighorn sheep and black bear roam free in the National Bison Range, just north of Missoula. This high plains refuge was established in 1908 to protect it from extinction. Today, the park is home to around 450.  Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park  Hike, bike, horse-ride, boat or drive through alpine landscapes in Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park, home to many endangered bears, big horn sheep, mountain goats, moose and grey wolves. The 84km (52-mile) Going-to-the-Sun Road is one of America's most scenic drives.  Yellowstone National Park  Watch spouting geysers, bubbling mud cauldrons, hot springs and fumaroles in Yellowstone National Park (www.nps.gov/yell), the oldest national park in the world, dating back to 1872, also shared with Idaho and Wyoming. Yellowstone is also home to rich wildlife and features the world famous Old Faithful geyser.",north america,united states of america,
mauritius,"A hypnotic blend of Indian, African and European influences, Mauritius might be synonymous with luxury beach breaks, but this destination will dazzle even the most discerning traveller, with its superb hiking, excellent mountain climbing and world-class diving.      The beaches are, indeed, noteworthy of praise. Encircling the island, they are exactly what the holiday brochures promise. But beyond its celebrated sands, native forests grow over the cooler central plateau, providing a home to rare plants and animals such as the Mauritius flying fox, which can be found nowhere else on Earth.      Back on the coast, a massive coral reef surrounds almost the entire island and has become a Mecca for divers thanks to its bountiful marine life. Hop out of the water and into local culture along the east coast, which is home to fine beaches and sleepy fishing communities. Village such as Petite Julie and Queen Victoria demonstrate the mixed Anglo-French heritage of the country, and it is in these sleepy outposts that you can hear sega music played in its most traditional form.      The northern regions offer the best combination of beaches, cuisine and nightlife. Further west, the capital, Port Louis, is famed for its Caudan Waterfront complex of restaurants, shops and casinos, as well as the colonial-era central market and Places D’Armes.      Dolphin safaris, rum distilleries and sand dunes add to the west’s appeal, though for many visitors the star attraction here is Le Morne mountain, which was used as a hideout by runaway slaves. A UNESCO World Heritage Site, this rugged outcrop has become synonymous with the struggle for freedom.      Friendly, welcoming and unremittingly beautiful, Mauritius offers not only fantastic weather and exquisite beaches, but also a distinct cultural identity that is well worth exploring.","Mauritius  Attractions in Mauritius  Bask on beautiful beaches  It's no exaggeration to say beaches are everywhere on Mauritius. Some of our favourite spots are on the northern beaches such as Trou aux Biches, shaded by tall casuarinas trees. Mont Choisy, a 2km (1.2 mile) stretch of white sand curves north from here, while between Grand Baie and Cap Malheureux lies the small cove of Péreybère.  Explore the marvellous Moka Range  Tour the Moka Range by quad bike, horse or a 4-wheel drive. For spectacular 360-degree views of Port Louis make the easy two-hour climb of Le Pouce, Mauritius' third highest mountain, which reaches a height of 812m (2,664ft). The village of La Laura is the best place to start the hike.  Follow the pilgrimage route to Grand Bassin  Grand Bassin's pilgrimage route leads pilgrims to a natural crater lake and sacred Hindu site on the Plaine Champagne. A towering statue of Shiva 33m (108ft) high heralds the entrance to the colourfully-decorated temples, busy with people and heavy with the scent of burning incense come festival time.  Get your adrenaline fix on Grand Baie  A seaside village with a beautiful beach and emerald waters, Grand Baie has become the centre of the island's watersports industry, with parasailing, underwater walks, submarine excursions and semi-submersible scooters all available. At La Cuvette, a long silky beach with clear water between Grand Baie and Cap Malheureux, sailors, windsurfers and waterskiers are welcomed.  Hike in Black River Gorges National Park  Black River Gorges National Park, a 6,800-hectare (17,000 acre) forest, provides a habitat for indigenous plants, birds and wildlife. It's also home to Little Black River Peak, Mauritius' highest mountain, which reaches for the sky at 830m (2,700ft). Hike to the summit or take the Maccabee Trail, which slopes down to the leafy banks of the Black River.  Learn to dive in pristine waters  Diving centres exist all along Mauritius' coast, to the west around Flic-en-Flac, in the north at Trou aux Biches, and on the Northern Islands to name just a handful of locations. The good underwater visibility, warm seas, and bountiful sea life make this one of the world's top diving destinations.  Let your imagination run riot at Le Souffleur  Unusually for reef-protected Mauritius, the full force of the ocean strikes its southern coast, leading to otherworldly rock formations. A cave in cliffs around Souillac at Le Souffleur helps funnel waves into a geyser 20m (65ft) high. A natural rock bridge exists at Pont Naturel, and at the clifftops of Gris Gris sits a rock shaped like a witch.  Peer through you binoculars on Ile aux Aigrettes  This Ile aux Aigrettes nature reserve lies off the coast of Mauritius and is home to several species that you will struggle to find anywhere else in the world, including the pink pigeon, giant Aldabra tortoises and Telfair's skink. 90 minute visits to the island leave daily from near Mahébourg.  Photograph the coloured earth of Chamarel  An extraordinary natural phenomenon, the famous coloured earths of Chamarel are believed to have been formed by various rock strata cooling at different speeds following volcanic activity here millions of years ago. They're certainly a beautiful sight, and the picture-perfect waterfall nearby is another reason to make the trip.  Relax on Rodrigues Island  Tiny, rugged, volcanic Rodrigues Island lies 560km (350 miles) east of Mauritius and is known as the 'anti-stress' island. Its capital, Port Mathurin, is only seven streets wide, with a friendly Creole population. Rodrigues offers walking, diving, kitesurfing, deep sea fishing and fabulously empty white sand beaches.  Set sail for the Northern Islands  Take a speedboat from Trou d'eau Douce to the popular island playground of Ile aux Cerfs for clean solitary beaches, golf and watersports. For a quieter day, take a catamaran through the crystal clear lagoons to the Northern Islands – Gabriel and Flat Island and Gunner's Quoin.  Spend the day at The Crocodile Park  The family friendly, La Vanille Réserve des Mascareignes nature park is commonly referred to as The Crocodile Park, for its thousands of Nile crocodiles. It is the only place worldwide to breed Radiata and Aldabra giant tortoises and also has deer, monkeys, boar, an insectarium, aquarium and small museum.  Stroll around Pamplemousses Garden  Pamplemousses Botanical Garden is the third oldest botanical gardens in the world and oldest in the southern hemisphere, having been created in 1770. Its international collection of plants includes a long pond of giant Amazon lilies and the talipot palm, which flowers once every 60 years, then dies.  Take a walking tour of Port Louis  A walk around the capital, Port Louis, offers the chance of encountering interesting attractions inside and out. It's worth exploring the fine colonial architecture of buildings such as Government House, which sits atop the palm-lined Place d'Armes, before popping into the Blue Penny Museum to gaze at one of the world's rarest stamps, or gawk at dodo skeletons in the Natural History Museum.  Take to the water at Blue Bay  Swim, snorkel or take a glass-bottomed boat out to see the fish and more than 50 species of coral in Blue Bay, Mauritius' only marine park. Better still, take a luxury excursion to the private island, Iles des Deux Cocos, just off the coast to explore the park from there.  Tour Mahébourg’s colonial past  The most characterful town on the island, Mahébourg, has a lively market, slowly mouldering colonial buildings and stalls on the new waterfront offering spicy gajaks (snacks) and a view across the bay of Grand Port, the site of the 1810 naval skirmish between the British and victorious French, and Lion Mountain.  Visit Mauritius Aquarium  Mauritius Aquarium, in the island's northwest in the village of Pointe Aux Piments, provides artificial habitats for 200 species of fish, invertebrates, coral and sponges originating from the waters around the island in five main buildings surrounded by tropical gardens. It also has a touch pool for children.  Wander around the National History Museum in Mahébourg  The colonial mansion now containing the National History Museum in Mahébourg contains a number of important island artefacts including the bell from the San Géran shipwreck that inspired Mauritius' most famous romantic legend, Paul et Virginie. There are also rooms dedicated to the Dutch, French and British periods of colonial rule.",africa,,
bolivia,"With its ice-capped Andean peaks, crystalline lagoons, rugged lowlands, Amazonian rainforest, terraced valleys and windswept altiplano, landlocked Bolivia is a virtual showcase of South America’s most dramatic landscapes.       Its iconic sights include Lake Titicaca, spiritual home of the Inca creation myth and highest navigable lake in the world; the Salar de Uyuni, highest and largest salt lake on earth; and La Paz, the world’s highest de facto capital. The panorama of the city’s ramshackle roofs sprawled across the basin beneath the mighty Mt Illampú is surely one of the most awesome views in the Americas.      The country’s greatest treasures are the Bolivians themselves. Nearly two thirds of the people are of indigenous origin, preserving the continent’s purest cultural roots, which, for visitors, means a dazzling array of colourful festivals, mysterious rituals, haunting folklore music, magical markets and dazzling costumed dances.      While bespoke tourism is emerging, there are also plenty of long bus journeys over precipitous mountain passes, rough-and-tumble jeep trips across empty landscapes and chilly nights at high altitude in budget hostels under llama wool blankets.      Bolivia’s cities encapsulate the country’s staggering contrasts. La Paz mixes both traditional and modern culture in a frenzy of collisions. Weave your way through the backstreets where cosmopolitan restaurants and lively bars compete with witch markets and speeding minibuses. By contrast, Santa Cruz has a younger vibe: famous for its spirited Carnival, it’s the booming hub of the tropical eastern lowlands. Colonial Sucre and Potosí are chronicles of Bolivia’s past – whitewashed mansions, gilt-lined churches, monumental plazas, and steep cobbled streets. While Tupiza and Uyuni offer something different altogether: the isolated culture of Altiplano towns.      From jungle greenery to vast white salt plains and wildlife-filled wetlands, the sweep of landscapes can be overwhelming: one day you can find yourself walking through a canyon of rock formations, the next volcanic geysers and endless stretches of white salt. It is this smorgasbord of remarkable features which keeps trips to Bolivia varied, alive and unforgettable.","Bolivia  Attractions in Bolivia  Be dazzled by the Salar de Uyuni  Travel around the Salar de Uyuni, a high-altitude salt lake, and marvel at its multi-coloured wonders. There's Laguna Colorado, whose fiery red waters harbour pink flamingos, and the stunning Laguna Verde, whose turquoise waters reflect the silhouette of ashen volcanoes. Explore the shimmering lunar landscape on a 4x4 safari and stay overnight in a gleaming salt hotel.  Climb the Cordillera Real  With its ice-capped peaks, condors and hawks, the Cordillera Real is an Andean highlight. You might even catch a glimpse of the spectacled bear; South America's only bear species. The mountain range has six peaks above 6,000m (20,000ft) and many more over 5000m (16,000ft). Climbing excursions (complete with mules, porters and guides) can be booked in Sorata, an Alpine-style village.  Cruise over Lake Titicaca  The largest high-altitude body of water in the world, Lake Titicaca straddles the Bolivia-Peru border. The enormous freshwater lake is home to several small island communities, including the floating Uros islands made entirely from reeds, and the sacred Isla del Sol with ancient Inca ruins. You can take boat cruises from Copacabana, or stay overnight on the Isla del Sol.  Discover the garden city of Cochabamba  With its year-round spring climate, the openness of the locals and its excellent local cuisine, Cochabamba is often hailed as the most welcoming city in Bolivia. For a bird's eye view, climb the 2,000 steps, or take the cable car, up to the imposing statue of Christ on Cerro San Pedro; explore the rambling street markets and sample some local maize beer.  Float down the Amazon  The Bolivian Amazon offers safari boat trips, eco lodges and nature trails. Setting out by boat from Rurrenabaque, linked by flights from La Paz, you can choose from a range of tours available to the Parque Nacional Madidi and the Pampas del Yacuma. Typical jungle trips include motorised canoe trips where you can see pink dolphins, guided rainforest walks and rustic accommodation.  Follow in Che Guevara’s final footsteps  Vallegrande, a quiet market town, was the resting place of Che Guevara. The town's Museo Municipal Ruta del Che Guevara displays photographs of the iconic guerrilla and his comrades; you can also visit various other Che sites, including the hospital where his body was put on display. Die-hard fans take the three-hour trip to La Higuera, the hamlet where Che Guevara died.  Gasp at the wonders of lofty La Paz  Otherworldly, majestic La Paz is the world's highest capital city, sprawled across an Andean basin at 3,632m (11,910ft) above sea level. Overlooked by snow-capped Mount Illimani, the city's chaotic street life reflects its blend of European and Aymaran identities. See colonial palaces, churches and museums, wander the cobbled streets around Plaza San Francisco and listen to haunting panpipes in a folk club.  Have a hell of a time at Oruro’s Carnival  Carnival is celebrated throughout Bolivia, but the annual street party at Oruro, is one of the most faithful traditional expressions of folklore in South America, with its historic 'Devil Dance' procession. This otherwise bleak mining town comes alive once a year with a spectacularly colourful and effervescent popular festival, attracting partygoers from around the world.  Mountain bike down 'Death Road'  Hurtle down the world's most dangerous road on a mountain bike. The adrenalin-fuelled trip starts at the Cordillera Real in the mountains and descends rapidly down twisting roads into the Yungas jungle. At some points the rough track, also know as 'Death Road, is only 3m (10ft) wide with 600m (2,000ft) drops down one side.  Ponder the mysteries of ancient Tiahuanaco  Near the southern shore of Lake Titicaca, are the impressive stone walls of Tiahuanaco, believed to have once been the capital of a major pre-Inca civilisation, established some three millennia ago. The site is dominated by a series of evocative temples, carved monoliths and a compelling museum of ancient artefacts.  Take the Jesuits Missions Trail  Dotted along the Jesuit Mission Trail east of Santa Cruz in Chiquitos, are a string of historic colonial churches. In the 18th century, Jesuit priests built these magnificent churches, before being expelled by the Spanish Crown. Six out of the 10 churches still exist today and now comprise a UNESCO World Heritage Site, home to a sacred music festival every other year.  Tour a tin mine in historic Potosí  Colonial Potosí was once the most important city on the continent and currently the highest city in the world at 4,100m (13,500ft) above sea level. Situated at the foot of Cerro Rico ('Rich Mountain'), Potosi was exploited for its mineral wealth, especially silver, and today is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Take guided tours to the mines, the striking churches and the former Royal Mint.  Trek through ancient Inca trails  The Bolivian Andes are crisscrossed by Inca trails, which provide a welcome challenge to hikers. Most treks start from La Paz and Sorata, and the most popular is the three-day Choros Trail from La Paz to Coroico. Also a three-day trek, the Taquesi Trail offers a moderate hike from La Paz, while the Illampus Circuit from Sorata is a demanding six-day affair.  Wander through whitewashed Sucre  Bolivia's constitutional capital Sucre, otherwise known as 'the white city' is a delightful place in which to unwind from the rigours of the Andes. Revered for its colonial architectural, the UNESCO World Heritage Site is home to beautiful churches, mansions and whitewash buildings. Wander the tranquil squares and market centre, which is known for its traditional weaving.",south america,,

guatemala,"Guatemala humbly has it all: from colonial towns to Mayan ruins, great mountain lakes to vibrant religious festivals, sandy beaches to exotic jungles. Often visitors to the country find they leave enlightened; civilisations they believed long gone are found thriving, Tomb Raider landscapes they thought fantasy are shown to be real.      Antiquity is at the heart of Guatemala, and the country is home to many spectacular Mayan archaeological sites, most significantly the vast UNESCO World Heritage Site of Tikal, where great towers peep through the rainforest canopy and monkeys swing past the sprawling ancient plazas. The pine-forested hills of the highlands are home to many Mayan communities, whose indigenous beliefs, traditional dress, religious practices and craftsmanship, flourish. Indeed, Guatemala has around 21 different ethnic groups, speaking some 23 languages giving it a distinctive culture like nowhere else in the region.      Although Guatemala boasts some truly stunning cities – most notably Antigua, an upmarket colonial town surrounded by smouldering volcanoes – Guatemala’s real joy is its nature. The great Lake Atitlan in the highlands is a place of rare beauty and offers various adventure activities ranging from scuba diving to fishing.      On the other side of the country, the vast and remote region of Peten houses the country’s thickest jungle, home to long-abandoned Mayan ruins that few get to see. Elsewhere, gargantuan lakes, lava-oozing volcanoes, black sandy beaches, natural hot springs and roaring rivers combine to form the most geographically diverse destination in Central America.      Though consistently beautiful, Guatemala is a nation of contrasts; a place where Catholic churches exist alongside Mayan temples, where rugged highlands give way to tropical jungles, and where the legacy of its ancient civilisations is as evident as its modern, Latin American culture.      Despite stories of high crime rates and volatile politics, most visitors encounter nothing but warmth and hospitality from its people, as well as epic landscapes that make them wonder why they didn’t visit sooner.","Guatemala  Attractions in Guatemala  Careen through the jungle  Thrill-seekers can get their kicks with a canopy tour, which involves flying through the jungle via a series of cables. Guatemala's rainforests are the perfect place to try this adrenaline-inducing activity and there are various opportunities for canopy tours around Antigua and Tikal.  Climb Mayan pyramids  Guatemala's most famous archaeological site, Tikal, is hidden deep within the rainforest where 70m (230ft) high pyramids poke through the canopy. Once home to an estimated 100,000 Maya, the UNESCO World Heritage Site contains more than 3,000 structures including temples and palaces as well as many species of wildlife, among them monkeys, anteaters and tapirs.  Discover Quetzaltenango  Known more commonly as Xela, the city of Quetzaltenango (Guatemala's second biggest) is ringed by three towering volcanoes and shelters a predominantly Mayan population. Use it as a base to discover nearby Mayan hamlets as well as for hikes to sacred lakes, sulphur pools and cloud forests.  Embark on a jungle adventure  Guatemala's great outdoors are easily accessible at Ixpanpajul Nature Park. This pocket of protected subtropical rainforest is ideal for hiking, biking, horse riding and even canopy touring. You may even encounter some of the park's many feathered inhabitants or a cheeky monkey or two cavorting in the canopy alongside you.  Enjoy Caribbean costal living  Livingston is a colourful, lively town on the Caribbean coast and exudes all the charm of its Garifuna residents. It can only be reached by boat along the Río Dulce, giving it an isolated, island feel. Thatched cabins, hammocks and rustic beachside bars and restaurants serve traditional, hearty cuisine and belt out music with a hip-swaying beat.  Explore the highlands  Explore the unique highlands region of Western Guatemala (known in Spanish as El Altiplano), inhabited by the greatest number of modern-day, indigenous Mayan groups – many of whom still speak the languages and uphold the sacred rituals of their ancestors. Great mountain passes and unspoilt beauty bolster the region's appeal.  Get to know Guatemala City  Most travellers don't linger in Guatemala's sprawling, traffic-clogged capital. But if you can withstand the fumes and frenzy, there are some enticing hidden gems to uncover, including Parque Central (bordered by the National Palace and the Cathedral), the enormous relief map in Minerva Park, and the city's wonderful art and archaeology museums, specifically the National Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology.  Hike an active volcano  Despite a series of recent eruptions, the highly active Volcan Pacaya is still one of the most hiked volcanoes in the country. Red hot molten lava slowly pours down the summit and huge dust and lava fields create an impressive landscape. The volcano can be hiked in an afternoon with an organised tour from nearby Antigua.  Lounge on black sands at Monterrico  Escape to the Pacific Coast's Monterrico, which offers remote black sand beaches and a laidback atmosphere. Spot sea turtles nesting on the volcanic sand and arrange to get involved with release programmes arranged by conservation organisations. Horse riding along the beach, visiting the mangrove swamps and learning Spanish are other popular activities in this region.  Purchase local handicrafts  Survey superb craftsmanship throughout Guatemala at towns like Jocotenango (renowned for its ceramics) and San Antonio Aguascalientes (feted for textiles). Salamá is a good place to buy silver, clay and leather handicrafts, while Momostenango (City of Altars) is the place to go for traditional handwoven ponchos.  See the shimmering Lake Atitlán  One of the world's most ancient lakes, the glistening surface of Lake Atitlán is framed by three volcanoes: Tolimán, Atitlán and San Pedro. Go waterskiing, swimming, boating or scuba-diving and visit some of the small towns and villages that dot the shore, such as the bohemian San Pedro de la Laguna and the Mayan Panajachel.  Shop for souvenirs at Chichicastenango Market  This mountaintop Mayan town is most famous for its colourful market. On Thursdays and Sundays, indigenous vendors pile into the main plaza and adjacent streets to sell handicrafts, textiles, food, flowers, pottery, medicinal plants, animals and household and farming items. It provides a wonderful insight into the local culture.  Swim in the turquoise pools of Semuc Champey  Semuc Champey Natural Park is one of Guatemala's most pristine beauty spots. Turquoise pools and waterfalls cascade down to a 300m (984 ft) limestone bridge, under which passes the Cahabón River, and activities include caving, tubing and hiking amidst the unspoilt jungle in the heart of Lanquín.  Take to the water  Guatemala's waterways are ideal for adventurers: Río Dulce and Lakes Izabal and Atitlán are a windsurfer's paradise, with the latter also popular for altitude diving. Fast-moving rivers, such as El Cahabón, El Chiquibul, El Motagua, La Pasión and El Usamacinta, are ideal for boating and shooting rapids, while the Cahabón River near Semuc Champey is prime tubing territory.  Travel the Río Dulce by boat  Take a boat trip from Livingston along the Río Dulce, which wends its way through steep cliffs, dense vegetation and lakes to Amatique Bay. Its waterways pass through mangroves, lagoons and the natural hot springs of the Chocón Machacas Biosphere. Keep an eye out for manatees splashing about as you float along.  Walk the cobblestone streets of Flores  Flores, situated on an island in the middle of Lake Peten Itza, is used as the main gateway to Tikal, but the tiny town is well worth visiting in its own right. A jumble of red-roofed buildings, which houses bountiful craft shops and cafés, it is the perfect place to enjoy sunset over the lake.  Wander colonial Antigua  Take a trip to the former capital, Antigua, with its colonial buildings, huge central square and lively festivals. Despite the damage wrought by countless earthquakes, floods and fires, Antigua remains one of the country's most beautiful cities where multi-coloured, single-storey buildings, tropical gardens, plazas, fountains and cobbled streets create a postcard-perfect image.",north america,,
iceland,"A country of extreme geological contrasts, Iceland has built up an impressive tourism sector with over 2 million visitors a year flocking to see its moss-covered lava fields, glacier-fed ice caves, rock-ribbed coast and ash-spouting volcanos.      Widely known as ""the land of fire and ice"", Iceland is crammed with magnificent scenery that delights and awes at every turn. The word fire in the phrase refers to Iceland's abundant volcanoes, which burst into life periodically. Elemental forces bubble just below the surface across the country, and clever Icelanders have long been accessing geothermal energy to generate electricity, heat tap water and warm up tomato greenhouses.      Volcanic tourism is also lucrative, with tourists taking trips to see bubbling fumaroles and soak in thermal springs. The two famous examples of the latter are the Blue Lagoon and Sky Lagoon near Reykjavík; both are geothermal spas that aim to soothe your aches and pains.      Ice is Iceland's other big draw (the clue is in the name) – more specifically, the dramatic glaciers that slice down towards the coast, calving icebergs into serene lagoons. About 11% of the country is covered in glaciers, with Vatnajökull being the largest and extending some 8,400km² (3,243mi²) in the southeast with thick layers of snow blanketing many high, majestic mountain ridges. Iceland's highest peak, Hvannadalshnjúkur (2,119m or 6,592ft) can also be found here. Guided tours to glaciers, ice caves and frozen waterfalls are widely available.      Reykjavík, Iceland's capital city, is where most travellers start their journey. This fun and vibrant city, with its many museums, marine excursions, and colourful nightlife, is certainly a worthy diversion.      So come to experience walking in a lava cave, climb a glacier, spot a whale, or catch the colourful northern lights in their full glory, undimmed by light pollution in the least densely populated nation in Europe. No matter what you do, a holiday in Iceland is an experience you'll remember for a lifetime.","Iceland  Attractions in Iceland  Geothermal spas  Iceland has many geothermal spas and the most famous ones are the Blue Lagoon and Sky Lagoon near Reykjavík. The former is covered in silica mud which is said to have skin-healing properties. The latter, launched in 2021 and is closer to Reykjavík than the Blue Lagoon, has an infinity pool and sauna that offer breathtaking views of the Atlantic Ocean.  Gullfoss  The Hvitá River forces its way through the basalt lava layers and thunders down in two stages before dropping into a narrow canyon below. Visitors can walk the one-mile trail and see the cascades from the overlook.  Jökulsárlón  At the edge of Vatnajökull National Park lies Jökulsárlón, a glacial lagoon formed in 1934 when Breiðamerkurjökull glacier started retreating. With floating icebergs and seals swimming in the lagoon, its surreal landscape makes it a favourite with photographers and film crews. Hollywood movies such as Die Another Day and Lara Croft: Tomb Raider were shot here.  National Parks  Iceland has three national parks: Þingvellir (Thingvellir), Vatnajökull, and Snæfellsjökull. Þingvellir, arguably the most famous national park in Iceland, is a powerful visual representation of continental drift as the American and Eurasian tectonic plates below the surface are pulling apart at a rate of a few centimetres a year. On the other hand, Vatnajökull and Snaefellsjokull are famed for snow-capped volcanoes.  Northern Lights  One of nature's most awesome spectacles, the Northern Lights are visible from late September to mid-April across the Icelandic sky. The ever-shifting, glowing patterns of light are caused by the electrically charged particles colliding with the atmosphere. Sightings are weather dependent and not guaranteed.  The Diamond Circle  This 250km (155mi) sightseeing route starts from Akureyri and connects five major attractions: the picturesque Goðafoss Waterfall, the blue/green landscapes of Lake Mývatn, the powerful Dettifoss Waterfall, the horseshoe-shaped Ásbyrgi Canyon, and the whale-watching hub of Húsavík.  The Golden Circle  Arguably the most famous sightseeing route among tourists, the 300km (186mi) Golden Circle connects Þingvellir (Thingvellir National Park), Gullfoss and Geysir – the three must-see attractions for any tourist to south Iceland. Many companies offer this full-day tour from Reykjavík.  The Great Geysir  The word ""geyser"" that we use to define a spouting hot spring comes from the Great Geysir in Hauka Valley, an area with many hot water blowholes. Within the geothermal park, the most active geyser is Strokkur, which erupts every 10-15 minutes or so.",europe,,
botswana,"Easily one of best safari destinations in Africa, Botswana is a wild and dramatic land characterised not only by its bountiful wildlife, but also by its extraordinary scenery: from shimmering salt pans and diamond-rich deserts to raging rivers and fertile flood plains, the landscapes here come in many guises.      Nearly half of the country is given over to national parks, reserves and private concessions, which makes for an excellent safari experience. Botswana’s policy of favouring low-impact luxury tourism ensures that even the most famous game-viewing areas rarely feel crowded, while its population of just two million adds to the sense of wilderness.      The north of Botswana in particular offers superb wildlife-watching opportunities. It is home to the wondrous Okavango Delta – the largest inland delta in the world – where shimmering lagoons and fertile waterways are crammed with more than 400 species of bird. Away from the water zebras and giraffes amble across grass flats and flood plains, keeping an eye out for the numerous big predators that also reside here.      Northeast of Okavango is another jewel in Botswana’s crown: Chobe National Park, which has one of the largest concentrations of game anywhere in Africa. The reserve is particularly well known for its vast elephant herds, some 400-strong, which share this wild land with the likes of lions, cheetahs, hippos and many more.      It’s not only in conservation that Botswana is an African success story. Since gaining independence in 1966, it has achieved steady economic growth through good use of its agricultural potential and enviable diamond reserves.      It has not entirely escaped controversy – the HIV/AIDS pandemic and alleged maltreatment of the Kalahari Bushmen have caused international concern – but it remains a peaceful and stable nation of remarkable natural beauty and its developed infrastructure makes it much more accessible than some of its neighbours.","Botswana  Attractions in Botswana  Cruise along the Chobe River  The languid and life-giving Chobe River is both exceptionally beautiful and bursting with wildlife. Probably the best place in Africa to see elephants swimming, you'd also be hard pushed to find a better spot for an evening boat cruise and a sundowner or three with hippos belly laughing all about you. To take the experience to another level, book a Chobe houseboat holiday.  Experience the beauty of Moremi Wildlife Reserve  Botswana's Moremi Wildlife Reserve lies in the centre of the Okavango Delta. The reserve encompasses a wide range of habitats – from wetlands, floodplains and reed beds to forests and savannah woodlands. The fauna inhabiting this pristine park is abundant and equally diverse, ranging from exotic birds, zebras, buffalo, wildebeest and giraffes to hippos and lions.  Get lost in Kgalagadi Transfrontier National Park  Encompassing ancient animal migration routes between Botswana and South Africa, this enormous desert park is bigger than the Netherlands and famed for its big cat population, particularly lion and cheetah. Other attributes include incredible night skies and overpowering stillness. It's still a relatively underexplored park, and a special place for wild camping.  Go on a game drive in Chobe National Park  Chobe National Park is Botswana's flagship park and easily combined with a visit to Victoria Falls just across the border into Zimbabwe or Zambia. The park itself is vast, wild and home to more than 100,000 elephants, sometimes seen in herds of up to 500. There are also plenty of predators, including leopard, lion and the critically-endangered African wild dog.  Paddle around the Okavango Delta  The oasis of the Okavango Delta is one of Africa's most iconic destinations and not without good cause. Positively teeming with wildlife and birdlife, this region of vast grass flats, low tree-covered ridges and narrow and intricate waterways is best explored in a mokoro, a traditional dugout canoe. This rustic means of transport takes you closer to the delta's staggering biodiversity.  Roar across the Makgadikgadi Pans  Traverse one of the world's largest salt pans on a quad bike to make the most of the awe-inspiring vistas and sense of isolation. Come at the right time of year and you'll also see southern Africa's most spectacular zebra and wildebeest migrations. The barren landscape is occasionally punctuated by strange and picturesque islands of baobab trees. You might spot the rare brown hyena here.  Sleep with the rhinos at Khama Rhino Sanctuary  Established in 1992, this community-based wildlife project is a shining example of Botswana's sterling conservation work and its emphasis on sustainable tourism. The peaceful sanctuary provides a safe haven for both white and black rhino, previously wiped out across most of the country, and there are onsite chalets and camping facilities.  Trek in the sacred Tsodilo Hills  Tsodilo Hills is a UNESCO World Heritage Site held sacred by Botswana's San Bushmen. Known to have been inhabited for at least 100,000 years, these dramatic, isolated hills are decorated with thousands of fascinating ancient rock paintings. A number of different hiking trails showcase both the stunning natural beauty and rich cultural heritage of these ancient landscapes.  Venture into Central Kalahari Game Reserve  Remote, enormous and virtually unexplored, the Central Kalahari Game Reserve is a refuge both for iconic wildlife and the country's few remaining Bushmen, nomadic hunter gatherers indigenous to southern Africa. Often referred to as one of Africa's last true wildernesses, roaring lions may be the only sound to puncture the overpowering desert stillness here.",africa,,
indiana,"Indiana accelerates to the max during its annual motor-racing extravaganza, but beyond the speedway, this is a gentle state of sprawling fields, pretty countryside and all-American small towns.      Adjoining Lake Michigan to the north, Indiana features deep valleys, cornfields that extend from horizon to horizon, foothills and vast farmlands. The state is home to peaceful Amish communities, covered bridges, Indian mounds and the famous Indy 500 motor-racing legend.      The Indianapolis 500 is more than a car race however. It’s a gigantic festival, with camping, glamping and two weeks of qualifying races before the main event. Pick-up trucks pull up at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, pop open their boots, and unload beer and barbecues for pre-race tailgating. Scantily clad fans party hard with live DJs and performers in the Snake Pit. And a massive parade of kaleidoscopic floats, giant balloons and marching bands takes place downtown on the eve of the final race.      At the opposite end of the speed spectrum, Amish horse-drawn buggies rattle along rural lanes in Northern Indiana, where life takes a distinctly slower pace. A Heritage Trail weaves through thriving historic towns crammed with antiques stores, flea markets and turn-of-the-century buildings.      For two weeks in August, half the state seems to land in Indianapolis once again for the Indiana State Fair, a massive agricultural spectacle blending animal shows with live concerts and fairground rides (no, that doesn't mean cows on the teacups).      Thrill-seekers are also well catered for in Indiana’s great outdoors. Hikers, bikers and mountain climbers make a beeline for the forested hills of Brown County State Park, which lay claim to some of the most exquisite autumn scenery in North America.","Indiana  Attractions in Indiana  Amish country  Visit northern Indiana's Amish country (www.amishcountry.org) to discover the region's rich heritage and friendly Amish communities, who still travel by horse and buggy.

marshall islands,"The Marshall Islands form a nation of scattered atolls and remote islands, which are known for their marine life and diving opportunities. Many of the atolls are dotted with Flame of the Forest, hibiscus and different-coloured plumeria flowers. There are also at least 160 species of coral surrounding the islands. The atolls are noted for their coconut and papaya plantations and for pandanus and breadfruit trees.  The Marshallese are an interesting bunch. Apart from being a skilled seafaring people who know fishing and navigating as well as anyone, they're a thoroughly multicultural bunch. After two millennia of being isolated, the islands began to be settled and colonised from the 18th century by a wave of successive visitors and occupiers, from British and Russians, to Germans, Japanese and Americans.  The most modern atolls bear the marks of all the above, with diverse restaurants and cuisine on offer. The capital of Majuro Atoll leans towards the Western, being relatively developed though still pretty laid-back. The real tropical wonders are the outer islands, which for the most part are immaculate freckles of paradise, though some have witnessed the horrors of nuclear testing.  The Marshall Islands are undoubtedly a diving hotspot, with many enthusiasts skipping the capital altogether and heading for a spot of nature diving at Rongelap. Diving among wrecks from World War II is also popular, though perhaps the main diving attraction is Bikini Island. You may have heard of Bikini. From or near here, some 23 nuclear devices were detonated in tests by the US in the reef, inside the atoll, by air and even underwater. Divers can go on guided tours to explore the history of nuclear testing, while UNESCO has declared Bikini a World Heritage Site for the fact the remaining, direct tangible evidence of nuclear testing. Leased to the US military, Kwajalein Atoll remains in use for missile testing.","Marshall Islands  Attractions in Marshall Islands  Be aware of the atomic legacy  Inevitably, most people will associate the Marshall Islands with the destructive US nuclear weapon testing of the Cold War such as Bikini Atoll. To this day, a large US military presence continues in the region with the Kwajalein Missile Range that incorporates Kwajalein Island, Roi-Namur Island and many smaller islands.  Drop in on the Alele Museum  The Alele Museum has preserved the history and local traditions of the Marshallese culture. Though not the biggest of museums, it provides a concise and compact introduction to the various stages of Marshallese history.  Experience life in Majuro  The capital of the Marshall Islands, Majuro is spread over 64 tiny islands and is the entry point for most visitors. The city has a bustling port, an international airport and plenty of hotels, which spill out onto golden beaches. To escape the crowds head to one of the many secluded lagoons.  Explore the marine life  Opportunities for diving include drop-offs, coral heads, black coral and WWII wrecks. Fishing expeditions can be arranged by local hotels or the Marshalls Billfish Club. The club also organises monthly fishing tournaments. For further information, consult the Marshall Islands Journal or the Visitors Authority.  Get to know Laura  The island community of Laura is the perfect place to kick back and relax. An evolving residential community with a popular beach that's proving to be a hit with those looking to escape the ""fast pace"" of Marshall Island life. With quiet white-sand beaches and shallow reefs that are perfect for snorkeling.  Go island hopping in Maloelap  There are regular day trips to the Maloelap and Mili atolls where there are opportunities to snorkel over WWII wrecks, eat local food and watch traditional dancing. There are also many historic sites and buildings.  Pack your snorkel gear and head for Jaluit  Okay, so this 91-island atoll might not have the most extensive tourist infrastructure, but this remoteness is all part of its appeal. As well as a modest hotel and a handful of food stores, the archipelago boasts some of the best scuba diving in the Marshall Islands. Don't fancy slipping beneath the waves? Then don your snorkelling gear – the atoll's marine life looks just as impressive from the surface.  Take a day trip to Eneko Island  Situated close to the Majuro Lagoon and accessed by a short 40-minute boat ride from Majuro, Eneko Island is run by a private residential company and features small bungalows ensconced in a gloriously remote location. Eneko remains a popular day trip for locals and tourists with its stunning beach.",oceania,pacific islands of micronesia,
uzbekistan,"Most people would struggle to find Uzbekistan on a map, let alone get around to visiting. But while this Central Asian nation remains a mystery to the masses, its obscurity makes it all the more appealing for more adventurous travellers.      Those who do make the trip are following in famous footprints: from Alexander the Great to Genghis Khan, some of the world’s most famous pioneers and conquerors have blazed a trail through this land.      Granted, Uzbekistan has its fair share of problems. It would be remiss not to mention the hard-line government, corrupt officials and Islamic militants that besmirch the reputation of the country. But they are the exception rather than the rule: most people in Uzbekistan extend legendary hospitality to visitors.      While the country is young, having gained independence in 1991 after the break-up of the Soviet Union, the roots of Uzbekistan are ancient.      The historic town of Samarkand, once a crossroads on the Silk Road, has long been known as the ‘Jewel of Islam’. One of the so-called Big Three (a term used to describe Uzbekistan’s three main Silk Road cities) its cityscape is dominated by sparkling turquoise domes and towering minarets adorned with intricate mosaics.      Stunning examples of this architecture can be found across Uzbekistan, most notably in Khiva, the best-preserved and most remote of the Big Three. It’s a living museum, home as it is to a vast collection of Islamic architecture, which remains frozen in time within the city walls. And then there’s Bukhara. The last one of the Big Three, it is also known as the ‘Pillar of Religion’ and is surely one of the most exquisite cities in the Islamic world.      It’s not all about manmade attractions, though. The Ferghana Valley is a place of unremitting natural beauty where fertile valleys give out to the snow-capped Tien Shan and Pamir mountains.      This also happens to be the country's most fertile region, its breadbasket, where visitors can enjoy stunning landscapes, local produce and friendly bazaars rarely seen by Western eyes.","Uzbekistan  Attractions in Uzbekistan  Boi-Bulok Caves  Explore the deepest caves in Asia at Boi-Bulok where the depths reach 1,415m (4,641ft) in depth, and Kievskaya whose depths hit 990m (3,247ft). These are suitable for experienced cavers only. Beautiful gypsum formations can be seen at the Kugitang cave, while the caves of Baisuntau contain mummified bears and those in western Tian Shan feature underground rivers and lakes.  Bukhara  Noted by many as one of the most interesting cities in the world, Bukhara, offers the visitor more than 350 mosques and 100 religious colleges to admire. At the centre of it all, is the Shakristan (the old town), where the Ark, or palace complex of the Emirs, can be found. Close by is the 47m-high (145ft) Kalyan Minaret. Other sites of interest in Bukhara include the covered bazaars, and the Kalyan Mosque which is open to non-Muslims. This is the place to do your shopping as everything from ikat fabric to silk road spices to Soviet memorabilia can be bought.  Chatkalsky Reserve  Keep an eye out for snow tigers, the rare Tian-Shan grey bear and the Berkut eagle in the Chatkalsky Reserve, a narrow unspoilt gorge in the western Tian-Shan. In the winter months trekking, skiing and snowboarding are popular and there are chairlifts, a marked sledge route, skiing equipment rental and training sessions for beginners.  Chorsu Bazaar, Tashkent  Tashkent's Chorsu ('four ways') Bazaar is a typical, but especially lively, bustling Central Asian bazaar. Covered stalls protect the piles of fruit and vegetables from the hot sun, and it is possible to barter for souvenir-friendly slippers, shawls, carpets, gowns and skull-caps just as traders and merchants have done over hundreds of years.  Cycle the Silk Road   Cycle from Tashkent via Lake Aidarkul to Khiva. Easier rides can be done in the Ferghana Valley and around Tashkent, where lake and mountain scenery can be enjoyed. Organised tours are available.  Ice climbing  If climbing an ice waterfall appeals, Uzbekistan offers plenty of opportunity with its many mountains, ice climbing is possible on the Gissar, Matcha and Turkestan ridges. Also, vertical rock faces for rock climbing can be found in the Fan mountains (at Bodkhana, Chapdara, Maria-Mirali and Zamok) and on the Matchi Ridge (at Aksu, Asan-Usan and Sabakh).  Khiva  Khiva, northeast of Bukhara, is near to the modern and disappointingly uninteresting city of Urgench. Khiva, though, is fascinating. Completely and painstakingly preserved, the city still lies within its original walls, and has changed little since the 18th century. As a museum town it is hardly inhabited, which many visitors notice immediately, although it is possible to imagine what it was like in its prime – a place of plumed turbans and pomegranates.  Kokand  Built in the early 19th century, the Juma Mosque complex is centred around a 22m- (72 ft-) minaret and includes 98 red-wood columns brought from India. The entire compound has reverted to its former Soviet guise as a museum, with one room housing a collection of suzani (textiles) and ceramics from the region. Admission includes a free tour, but only in Russian.  Nukus Museum (Karakalpak Museum of the Arts)  View the best collection of Russian avant-garde art outside St Petersburg in Nukus, the capital of Karakalpakstan, in the west of the country. It is also home to one of the largest collections of archeological objects and folk, applied and contemporary art originating from Central Asia.  Observatory of Ulug Beg  Other sites of interest in Samarkand include the Observatory of Ulug Beg, Timur's grandson, which was the most advanced astronomical observatory of its day. There is also the Afrasiab Museum, not far from the observatory, containing a frieze dating from the sixth century, which shows a train of gifts for the Sogdian ruler of the day.  Samarkand  See the site of Alexander the Great's slaying of his friend Cleitos at Samarkand, the pivot of the Silk Road and the city transformed by Timur in the 14th century into one of the world's greatest capitals. Much of its past glory survives or has been restored. The centre of the historical town is the Registan Square, where three huge madrassas (Islamic seminaries) - including Shir-Dor and Tillya-Kari - built between the 15th and 17th centuries, dominate the area. Decorated with blue tiles and intricate mosaics, they give some idea of the grandeur that marked Samarkand in its heyday. The Bibi Khanym Mosque, not far from the Registan, is testimony to Timur's love for his wife. Now it is a pale shadow of its former self, having been partly destroyed in the 1897 earthquake, and seems permanently under repair. Timur himself is buried in the Gur Emir. On the ground floor, under the massive cupola, lie the ceremonial graves of Timur and his descendants. The stone that commemorates Timur is reputed to be the largest chunk of Nephrite (jade) in the world. The actual bodies are situated in the basement, which unfortunately is not open to the public.  Shah-i-Zinda  The Shah-i-Zinda is a collection of the graves of some of Samarkand's dignitaries. The oldest date from the 14th century as Samarkand was starting to recover from the depredations of the Mongol hordes of the 13th century. Its shiny restoration in 2005, remains controversial.  Skiing  The mountain resort of Beldersay, covered with snow in the winter months, and juniper and apple forests in the spring and summer, is located 80km to the southeast of Tashkent. The Beldersay route, divided into three skiing zones, is registered in the FIS (Federation of International Skiing) and has a length of 3020m (9900 ft).  Tashkent  Compare old and new in Tashkent. The capital preserves only a small proportion of its architectural past. A massive earthquake in 1966 flattened much of the old city and it was rebuilt with broad, tree-lined streets. The new buildings are of little architectural interest but earlier buildings lie in the old town to the west. A myriad of narrow winding alleys, it stands in stark contrast to the more modern Tashkent. Of interest among the older buildings are the 16th-century Kukeldash Madrasa and the Kaffali-Shash Mausoleum. Many of the Islamic sites in Tashkent are not open to non-Muslims, and visitors should always ask permission before entering a mosque or any other religious building. Tashkent Museums  Tashkent has many museums to explore. The eccentric State Fine Arts Museum of Uzbekistan is one of the most popular and aside from the Soviet masterpieces and the Uzbek art that dominates the ground and first floors, out the back is the wonderful Fidoliyar garden which is full of the graves of Bolsheviks who died in revolutionary street fighting. Elsewhere in the city there is the Museum of Applied Arts, a Literary Museum (Alisher Navoi Literary Museum) and the Art Gallery of Uzbekistan.  Trekking  Trek in the mountains in the south of the country. There are high peaks for those wanting a challenge, while easier treks can be done in the foothills and on the plateaux. The best time to go is between March and November. There is superb hiking along the spurs and gorges of the Chatkal Range to the ancient silver mine in the Chatkal Natiore Preserve.",asia,,
norway,"From precipitous glaciers to steep-sided gorges and crystalline fjords, Norway’s natural beauty is impossible to overstate. The unspoilt wilderness of the Arctic north is one of the few places where the sun shines at midnight during the summer and where the magnificent Northern Lights brighten the skies during the long winter nights.      Further to the south, the picturesque cities of Oslo, Trondheim and Bergen are brim-full of buildings showing off Scandinavia’s age-old flair for design in cosmopolitan surroundings. Oslo is the present-day capital and financial centre, while the country’s second city, Bergen, is a picturesque former Hanseatic trading port and gateway to the fjords of Norway. Stavanger is the focal point of the Norwegian oil industry and former capital, Trondheim, is a long-established centre of Christian pilgrimage, and more recently, technical research.      Though the weather can be a tad grim in Bergen, the UNESCO-listed waterfront adds a flash of colour with its wooden warehouses and shimmering harbour. Oslo’s waterfront is no less beautiful and has an ice-white Opera House that could give Sydney’s version a run for its money.      Stunning though the cities are, the real wonders of Norway are to be found outdoors. In the far north, the glacier-covered sub-polar peninsular of Svalbard is one of the few areas where polar bears can be seen in the wild and Norway’s miles of Arctic tundra double up as a destination for skiing and spotting the Northern Lights.      Elsewhere, a ferry trip along Geirangerfjord must rank among the world’s prettiest voyages with pine-topped cliffs giving way to icy green water, regularly topped up by the waterfalls that cascade down the fissured sides of the ravine. Indeed, you’d be hard pushed to find a part of Norway’s northern fjord area that isn’t strikingly beautiful, with snow-capped peaks and looming forests almost everywhere you look.","Norway  Attractions in Norway  Bergen funicular  Take a ride to the summit of one of the seven mountains surrounding the former Hanseatic port of Bergen (www.visitbergen.com), for panoramic views of the country's longest fjord - Sognefjord – to the north and the beautiful Hardangerfjord in the south.  Bergen harbourside  Stroll around the picturesque wooden warehouses in Bergen's historic Bryggen harbourside area – a UNESCO World Heritage site since 1979. Explore the fish market nearby (www.visitbergen.com), or take a trip out to Troldhaugen, former home of composer Edvard Grieg (griegmuseum.no).  Coastal voyage  Experience the midnight sun at the North Cape in the far Arctic and make the most of the extra daylight by enjoying the coastline from the deck of one of the Hurtigruten ships (www.hurtigruten.co.uk), which call at 35 different ports on the voyage north.  Folk culture  Experience traditional Norwegian folk culture, music, dance and food at one of the regular summer events at the Norske Folkemuseum (www.norskfolke.museum.no): an open-air collection of historic buildings on Bygdøy Island outside Oslo. The programme changes daily, so check the website before you go.  Fredrikstad  Check out Gamlebyen in Fredrikstad, one of Scandinavia's best-preserved fortress towns. Also of interest is the nearby Hvaler archipelago, a summer paradise made up of hundreds of tiny islands - and home to Norway's first marine national park, opened in 2009 (www.opplevfredrikstad.com).  Glacier hike  Take a hike on Jostedalsbreen, mainland Europe's largest glacier, and centrepiece of a large national park (www.jostedal.com). A mecca for outdoor adventure lovers, the park offers plenty of adrenaline sports such as mountain kayaking as well as the more sedate Glacier Bus.  Hardanger Fjord  Hardanger Fjord, which is located 75km (47 miles) east of Bergen, is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Norway. This scenic area offers virtually every kind of natural landscape available in the country, from scenic waterways, apple and cherry orchards, and hiking trails, to mountain plateaux. The area also contains Hardangervidda, Norway's largest national park, two of Norway's largest glaciers, Folgefonna and Hardangerjøkulen, and some of Norway's most popular waterfalls, including Vøringfossen, Steinsdalsfossen and Låtefossen. There are also various museums in the area, including Hardanger folkemuseum (Hardanger Folk Museum) and Hardanger Fartøyvernsenter (Hardanger Ships Preservation Centre) treeboat museum.  Historic Oslo  Go royal-spotting at the Kongelige Slott (Royal Palace), which is open to visitors from late June to mid-August (www.kongehuset.no), or delve into the city's military past at Åkershus Castle (www.forsvarsbygg.no), which stands within walking distance of the city centre.  Ibsen's birthplace  For those in search of a literary treat, Skien, the birthplace of playwright Hendrik Ibsen (http://www.telemarkmuseum.no/en/henrik-ibsen-museum/), is a must visit. His childhood home provides a compelling insight into the life of this distinguished Norwegian and includes a comprehensive multimedia exhibition.  Lakeside cabin  Get away from it all and spend a few days in a lakeside mountain hytte, or cabin, enjoying fishing and nature walks. But beware of elk and other large wildlife (www.norgesbooking.com).  Maelstrom and Bodø  See the Saltstraumen - the world's most powerful whirlpool. A strong tidal current located some 30km (19 miles) east of the northern city of Bodø; careful timing is required as the action only happens four times a day. A multimedia visitor centre is nearby.      The port city of Bodø, north of the Arctic Circle on the west coast of Norway, will be the European Capital of Culture in 2024. More than 600 events will fill Bodø's cultural calendar in the event year. The program has many highlights, including music and arts festivals, an exhibition about Nobel Prize winner Knut Hamsun, a concert in a cave and a Sámi theatre trilogy. The grand opening ceremony will take place on February 3, 2024 in Bodø's inner harbour.             In addition to dance, theater and concerts as well as a few museums, Bodø also has a diverse gastronomic scene with numerous gourmet restaurants, cafés and bars. Fish dishes are naturally particularly delicious here, right by the sea. There is also a shopping center and a water park with a wellness area, which will reopen in late 2023, freshly renovated. Bodø has its special charm simply because of its location on a peninsula directly by the sea. The city feels like a lively cultural center surrounded by untouched wild nature - a contrast that many appreciate.             Bodø is in the Salten region, which is in Nordland county. With its many charms typical of Norway, this area fulfills all the wishes that its visitors usually bring with them. There are caves, glaciers, national parks, high mountains, beautiful hiking landscapes, breathtaking coastal landscapes with picturesque fjords and natural phenomena such as the Saltstraumen tidal current, the popular sky spectacles of the northern lights and the midnight sun.      Bodø is easily accessible, even though it is in the far north. The coastal city has road connections, a small airport, to which Scandinavian Airlines flights from Oslo go several times a day, a long-distance train station and a ferry terminal for Hurtigruten cruise and passenger ships as well as for ferries on their way to and from the offshore islands like the Lofoten.  Medieval wooden churches  Be sure to see one of Norway's 28 surviving wooden medieval stave churches (www.stavechurch.org), dotted around the southern half of the country. The oldest is the UNESCO World Heritage-listed Urnes Stave Church, by Sognefjord, dating from 1130 (www.sognefjord.no).  Northern Lights  Few sights are more hauntingly beautiful than that of the aurora borealis or Northern Lights – a natural phenomenon caused by magnetised particles emitted by the sun. You'll have to brave the winter cold of Norway's Arctic region (October to March) to see them but it's well worth it.  Norway in a nutshell  Take a 'Norway in a Nutshell' tour from Bergen (www.norwaynutshell.com). You can choose to spend between one and three days on the trip, which takes in scenic rail and bus journeys as well as cruises along Norway's best fjords.  Oslo museums  Don't miss the capital's excellent collection of museums, including the Thor Heyerdahl Kon-tiki Museum (www.kon-tiki.no), the Munch Museum (http://munchmuseet.no/en/) and the Viking Ship Museum (www.khm.uio.no).  Preikestolen (Pulpit Rock)  Perched on top of a jutting 600m-tall (1969 ft) cliff overlooking the cerulean blue waters of Lysefjord, Pulpit Rock is worth the hike for the stunning views alone. Just outside of Stavanger, the rock can also be reached via a cruise along Lysefjord from the city centre.  Røros  This small but picturesque mountain town near the Swedish border is a UNESCO World Heritage site. It was a copper mining and smelting settlement from the 17th century until the 1977 (www.verdensarvenroros.no). Discover the Old Town, the wooden church and the Mining Museum.  Saint Olav Festival  Enjoy the annual festival celebrating Christianity's arrival in Norway in 1024 at Stiklestad, a little over two hours' drive northwest from Trondheim. Centrepiece of the July event is the St Olav Drama, an open-air recreation of that occurred just prior to the Battle of Stiklestad (www.stiklestad.no).  Sami culture  Learn about the culture of the semi-nomadic Sami people of Norway's northern Lapland at the Várjjat Sámi Musea (www.varjjat.org) at Varangerbotn in eastern Finnmark. Or stay in a Sami tepee on an organised tour of Lapland (www.sami-siida.no, Norwegian only).  Skiing and snowboarding  Norway has thousands of kilometres of marked trails of varying difficulty for enthusiastic skiers and snowboarders, all of which take in stunningly pretty terrain. The 1994 Winter Olympics complex at Lillehammer (www.lillehammer.com) is just a couple of hours north of Oslo by road.  Svalbard  Made famous by Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials Trilogy, Norway's most northerly landmass, Svalbard, is the only place in Europe where the polar bear can still be seen. Although glaciers cover 60% of it, Svalbard's soaring mountains and dramatic crags make it worth seeing whether you want wildlife or not.  Tromsø brewery  Enjoy a beer or two at the world's most northerly brewery in Tromsø – which claims to be Europe’s most northerly city. Once you’ve had your fill of the local brew, head over to visit the picturesque university and cathedral, and revel in the scenic surroundings. (https://www.visittromso.no/en).  Trondheim  Relive Norway's former capital city Trondheim's past glories at the magnificent Nidarosdomen (Nidaros Cathedral) (www.nidarosdomen.no), and visit the city's Ringve Museum (www.ringve.com), which is home to an extensive collection of historic musical instruments.  Vøringsfossen waterfall  Take in the stunning views at Norway's most famous waterfall, situated close to the main road between Oslo and Bergen. Another nearby waterfall, Mardalsfossen, boasts the longest drop in northern Europe clocking up almost 300m (984ft) from top to bottom. (www.fjordnorway.com).  Ålesund  Often overlooked in favour of the bigger municipal centres, Ålesund is home to an unparalleled collection of picturesque Art Nouveau buildings, built a century ago after its wooden edifices were razed by a fire. The city is also becoming increasingly accessible with a number of airlines serving it directly.",europe,,
benin,"In many ways Benin is the perfect introduction to Africa. A land of pristine beaches, bountiful wildlife and hospitable inhabitants, travelling around the country is a doddle thanks to its small size and advanced infrastructure.      The birthplace of voodoo and one of the major departure points for the more than eight million people forced to leave the continent as slaves, the country also has a complex and compelling history that filters down into everyday life to create a jumble of the familiar and the strange.      Stay in the south to experience Benin’s major cities, the slightly chaotic yet vibrant commercial hub of Cotonou and the laidback capital Porto Novo. Take some time out from the capital’s lagoon-side location and palm-fringed Atlantic beaches to request an audience with the tribal princes of Ajase, Porto Novo’s ancestral name, while visiting the palace museum.      Head along the coast to experience the unique lives of the Tofinu people at Ganvié, a bamboo stilt village often referred to as the “Venice of Africa.” Or take advantage of Benin’s small size and good roads to explore the country’s spectacular countryside, which harbours remote towns and exquisite national parks. Home to lions, hippos and elephants, not to mention myriad bird species, Benin’s flagship national park is Pendjari, which serves up spectacular fauna without the crowds.      A thriving arts scene across the country has given rise to stunning public sculptures and fantastic architecture, which complement the elegance of the wooden Afro-Brazilian mansions of Porto Novo and Ouidah. The latter is the beating heart of Benin’s voodoo practitioners and an important stop for those interested in the history of the Atlantic slave trade.      Small in size but not in stature, Benin has something to suit every interest, be it the wild landscapes of the north, the bustling metropolises of the south, or the shared religion and history that bind this country and its people together.","Benin  Attractions in Benin  Brush up on your history in Porto Novo  The gateway to Benin for most visitors, Porto Novo, Benin's laidback capital, is home to some exquisite examples of colonial and pre-colonial architecture, not least the Brazilian-style Big Mosque. Other attractions of note include the eclectic Musée da Silva, which offers a brief history of Benin, and the Porto Novo Museum of Ethnography. Royalists might want to head to King Toffa's Palace, where the Musée Honmé reveals the secrets of local royalty.  Discover Somba culture in Natitingou  Natitingou's regional museum provides an impression of life for Benin's Somba communities that primarily inhabit the northeast of the country. Located within an elegant colonial structure previously used by local government, exhibits relate to archaeology, history and art. The habitat room has examples of traditional Somba homes.  Explore Cotonou’s bustling streets  Set between the Atlantic Ocean and Lac Nokoué, Cotonou is Benin's largest and most important city. Its market, the sprawling Dantokpa, covers a whopping 20 hectares (49 acres) and sells everything from toothbrushes to fresh fruit – a great way to experience the city. The nearby Foundation Zinsou, which promotes modern African art, is also well worth a visit.  Feed your brain in Abomey  The dusty city of Abomey is home to the eponymous Abomey Historical Museum, which offers an insight into the history of the Abomey Kingdom and contains a throne made of human skulls. Whilst you're in town, pay a visit to the opulent royal palaces, swing by the Fetish Temple and peruse the local wares at the Centre Artisanal.  Follow the Route of Slaves in Ouidah  Ouidah was once a major centre for the slave trade, a place where slaves were led from the Portuguese Fort (now a museum) along a 4km (2.5 mile) sandy track to waiting ships that would take them across the Atlantic. Today the track is lined with poignant memorials such as the Tree of Forgetfulness. The path ends at the Door of No Return memorial arch.  Indulge your inner artist at Villa Karo  A cultural centre and artists' residence, Villa Karo in Grand Popo is a Finnish-African project that aims to improve understanding between cultures. The centre puts on a range of events including art exhibitions, film screenings and concerts and is a great way to get involved with the local community, which relies largely on its modest fishing industry.  Journey north for wildlife watching  See a wide range of wildlife including cheetahs, hippos and crocodiles at Benin's two national parks. Though celebrated for its diverse landscapes and big game, Pendjari National Park is mostly vaunted for its varied birdlife. The UNESCO-listed W National Park provides a home for some of West Africa's last wild elephants and straddles the frontier between Benin, Niger and Burkina Faso.  Relax by the water  Although beaches are strung all along Benin's 120km (75 mile) Atlantic coastline, the best quality sands are found at Grand Popo and Ouidah. Facilities for water sports on the coast are limited, though it's possible to sail at the Yacht Club in Cotonou, or hire a dug-out canoe or motorboat on Lac Nakoué.  Take a dip at Kota Falls  The isolated 20m-high (65ft) waterfalls at Kota provide a relaxed and secluded pool to take a refreshing dip, and an idyllic setting to while away an afternoon with a picnic. Accommodation makes it possible to stay overnight, and enjoy the solitude and romanticism even longer.  Visit the ‘Venice of Africa’  Floating in Lac Nokoué, and only accessible by boat, the stilt village of Ganvie is home to a staggering 20,000 people. A fully-fledged and atmospheric town, it was constructed sometime between the 16th and 17th centuries as a safe haven for the Tofino people against local slave traders.",africa,,
reunion,"One of the last vestiges of the French colonial empire, you can hardly blame Paris for keeping hold of this slice of paradise. Floating in the Indian Ocean, east of Madagascar, Réunion serves up an enticing mix of Creole culture, exotic fauna and natural wonders.      Administered directly from Paris (it also flies the tricolore and is part of the Eurozone), the island has a distinct cultural identity, which has resulted from 400 years as a remote outpost of empire.      Its history is best absorbed wandering through the old heart of Saint-Denis, the island’s de facto capital. Edifices that would not look out of place in the French capital line streets and public spaces buzz with the sound of French, Creole, Cantonese and Tamil, among myriad other languages. English is almost never one of them.      The beaches are a big draw, but Réunion’s flora and fauna is equally enticing. The island’s fresh water lakes, rivers and waterfalls support some 90 species of bird, while its coral reefs harbour an abundance of marine life. Whales are also regularly observed from the beaches between May and September.      Away from the coast, much of the island’s forested and mountainous interior is protected and designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. A variety of activities are available, from paragliding to rock climbing and hiking. Trekking paths lead to natural wonders such the 3,000m (10,000ft) extinct volcano Piton des Neiges (the highest point anywhere in the Indian Ocean), or the lunar landscapes around Piton de la Fournaise, one of the most active volcanoes in the world.      With centuries of influence from Europe, Asia and Africa, Réunion offers Gallic charm with a tropical twist, an island where history and natural beauty abound.","Reunion  Attractions in Reunion  Delve into the warm turquoise waters  Good swimming and diving are to be found along the Sous le Vent coast, especially at Saint-Gilles-des-Bains, which has a lagoon shielded from the open ocean by a reef. Though the reefs are protected habitats, scuba-diving and snorkelling are permitted. Surfing can be practised in Saint-Gilles, Saint-Paul and Saint-Pierre.  Explore the island’s flora  Inhale the scent of Réunion's exquisite tropical flowers, trees and fruit across the island; tours aim to show the visitor some of the many endemic species. Alternatively, head to the well-kept Jardin de l'Etat botanical gardens in the capital Saint-Denis, or the Jardin L'Eden tropical gardens at Saint-Gilles-des-Bains.  Hike through volcanic valleys  A special feature of Réunion is its so-called cirques – large volcanic valleys surrounded by mountains, creating natural amphitheatres of about 10km (6 miles) in diameter. The most beautiful is probably Salazie, with its magnificent waterfalls, especially those known as Le Voile de la Mariée (The Bride's Veil) near Hell-Bourg.  Relax on Réunion’s beaches  Réunion does not have extensive beaches, but those on the west coast are beautiful with yellow, black or white sands. Some of the best beaches are to be found at Saint-Gilles, Saint-Leu (where the Coral Turtle Farm is worth a visit) and Étang-Sale. These are mostly shallow coral, running out to a reef.  Take a tour of Saint-Denis  Saint-Denis, the capital, is surrounded by mountains on three sides and has several places of interest, including the Natural History Museum and the Léon Dierx Art Gallery with its collection of French Impressionist paintings. There are various temples, a mosque and a cathedral, a sign of the cultural and religious variety of the island population.  Take in the mountain air  Réunion has over 600km (370 miles) of marked footpaths, and good climbing can be had among its volcanic peaks. Cilaos, once infamous as a refuge for escaped slaves, with impressive views of Le Bras Sec and Îlet à Cordres, rises approximately 1,220m (4,000ft). Piton des Neiges is the island's highest point, while Mafate is its most secluded valley, still inaccessible by road.  Tour the market at Saint-Paul  The island's many communities gather together in Saint-Paul for the lively street market that occurs every Friday afternoon and Saturday morning. Situated along the seafront of the island's first capital, stalls selling local produce and handicrafts abound, as do pop-up kitchens selling traditional Creole fare.  Trek across an active volcano  Réunion has some fantastic trekking opportunities, none more so than the path to Nez-de-Boeuf (Ox's Nose) mountain, which affords a splendid view over the Rivière des Remparts, 1,000m (3,300ft) below. Both the 8km-wide (5 miles) Enclos Fouque crater and the 2,632m (8,632ft) summit of the active volcano Piton de la Fournaise can be explored on foot.  Wander through the magical Bébour forest  Tamarind trees and large prehistoric-looking ferns dominate the Forêt de Bébour-Bélouve, in the centre of the island. Mosses hang from the tree branches in the humid air, while rare endemic birds dart among them. Best accessed from the town of Plaine-des-Palmistes, the forest is almost deserted on weekdays despite being a popular weekend retreat.  Witness the Hindu festival of Cavadee  Réunion's mixed heritage has left an island bursting with cultural spectacles. The island's Tamil community, for instance, perform the cavadee (burden dance) during the colourful Hindu festival of Thaipusam in January or February. Taking place in Saint-André, it requires devotees to carry heavy burdens while performing additional acts of devotion such as skin piercing.",caribbean,french overseas possessions,
poland,"Underrated but increasingly popular, Poland offers a huge amount for travellers of all stripes – from the stunning old towns of Krakow, Zamość, Gdańsk and Wroclaw to the wilderness of the Białowieża National Park with its ubiquitous buffalos and epic vistas.      Home to Europe’s most infamous ghetto, Warsaw was almost totally destroyed during WWII, but the Polish capital is modernising fast. Today the city blends Soviet architecture and contemporary styles, with a painstakingly recreated old town and an upbeat, progressive population.      Perhaps the country's biggest draw, though, is Krakow. The country's former royal capital is a wonderfully preserved architectural marvel that has somehow managed to survive Poland’s many wars. Even the Nazis thought it was too beautiful to bomb. Jam-packed with churches, monasteries and abbeys in Gothic and Renaissance styles, the city became the first ever UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1978 (an honour it shared with Quito, Ecuador).      Beyond Krakow are numerous signs of Poland’s proud cultural heritage: Łódź and its famous film school, from which Roman Polański and Krzysztof Kieślowski graduated; Toruń, the hometown of astronomer Nicholas Copernicus; and Warsaw, which lays claim to Marie Curie and Frederick Chopin. The country's biggest port and northern boomtown, Gdańsk, is best known as the birthplace of Lech Wałęsa's Solidarity movement, which led the country into democracy in 1989.      Poland's scenic beauty is as varied as it is extraordinary. The Baltic coast is pretty, while Słowiński National Park is all ethereal forests, bogs and sand dunes. The Great Masurian Lakes in the northeast are popular for kayakers, with hundreds of pristine lakes broken up by dense forest. The Krakow-Wielun Upland with its limestone caves and medieval castles is another highlight, while the Carpathian Mountains in the far south are unremittingly beautiful.      And the food? Polish cuisine is hearty and filling, rich in meat and game. Thick soups such as Zurek are delicious, as are pierogi, or Polish dumplings. And as for the Polish vodka, one of the finest types in the world, what better way to wash all that rich food down?","Poland  Attractions in Poland  Climb the Tatras Mountains  For alpine diversions there's nowhere better than the Tatras. Zakopane is a centre for climbing and winter sports where a fairy-tale atmosphere pervades with its ""gingerbread"" wooden cottages – some inhabitants still wear traditional goralski (highlander) dress. Visit the beautiful Kościeliska Valley, Mount Kasprowy Wierch and the emerald-green glacial lake Morskie Oko.  Delve into the Wieliczka Salt Mine  The spectacular Wieliczka Salt Mine, located just outside Cracow, is one of Poland's premier tourist attractions. Built in the 13th century, the UNESCO-listed site boasts 300km (186 miles) of shafts and tunnels, which are festooned with statues and chapels hewn out of salt by miners. Just 2km (1.2 miles) of the mine is accessible to visitors and the tourist route takes visitors 135m (445ft) underground as it passes through impressive chambers, with bas-reliefs, chandeliers and a chapel sculpted.  Enter Lublin through the Cracow Gate  The primary entrance into the Old Town, the Cracow Gate is considered to be the landmark symbol of Lublin. Built in the late 14th century and remodelled in 1782, its tower of red brick was part of the original city fortifications. It also houses a historical museum.  Explore the old port city of Gdańsk  Gdańsk is home to the largest Gothic church in Poland, St Mary's Basilica, while the beach resort at nearby Sopot has the Molo, Europe's longest pier at 515m (1700ft). Within easy reach are the forested Hel Peninsula and beach, the Kashubian Lakeland, and the Teutonic castles at Malbork and Gniew.  Go hiking in Poland's nature reserves  There are few things more inspiring than a march through Poland's national parks and nature reserves. Hikers should visit Kampinos National Park near Warsaw, while the Bieszczady National Park, part of the Carpathian Mountain, contains the surviving fragments of the Great Bieszczady Forest, home to lynx, wolf, wildcat and up to 120 brown bears.  Go mushroom picking  Going for a long meandering walk in the woods to pick mushrooms in the early autumn is a great way to spend a day in Poland. In fact, mushroom picking has been a Polish tradition for centuries, and many delicious varieties exist in the country. Just be sure to go with an experienced mushrooms expert.  Hit the beaches of the Pomeranian coast  Poland boasts some of the very best beaches in northern Europe, especially the resorts along the Pomeranian coast, such as large and fashionable Kołobrzeg or Łeba, whose beach is of fabulous white sand. The beach connects to the Słowiński National Park, known for its giant ""wandering sand dunes"" which can shift several metres each year.  Learn about the Holocaust at Auschwitz  The victims of the Holocaust are remembered at Oświęcim-Birkenau (Auschwitz-Birkenau) concentration camp, now a state museum 66km (41 miles) from Cracow. Visiting is a sobering experience, but helps give you perspective on one of history's darkest periods.  Learn about the resistance in the Warsaw Rising Museum  A walk through the Warsaw Rising Museum is an educational and interactive experience that anyone interested in Poland's World War II history should not miss. The museum features films, testimonials, slides and artefacts from the war when Warsaw residents were active in the resistance.  Sail your way through the Masurian Lake District  The Masurian Lake District, consisting of over 1,000 lakes, is a favourite angling and boating destination. A popular trail can take you past several lakes and canals. Local towns such as Mikołajki and Giżycko host sea-shanty festivals and other lively events.  See the bison in Białowieża National Park  Białowieża National Park is the last major refuge of the European bison as well as being home to many other rare forest-dwelling species, and trees up to 500 years old. Nature trails, cycling and exploring with a ranger are on offer.  Soak up the medieval vibes of Cracow  You'll immediately feel the charming medieval atmosphere of UNESCO-listed Cracow, one of Europe's most significant historical sites. In the middle of the main market square (the largest in Europe) is the Cloth Hall, which dates back to 14th-century. There's also the fascinating former Jewish quarter and its 16th-century Remuh synagogue, Wawel Castle and the Gothic cathedral. Great bars and restaurants abound.  Travel by horse-drawn sleigh  A horse-drawn sleigh ride is a magical experience, though be sure to have either warmed beer or heated honey vodka afterwards. Snow falls throughout Poland during the winter months so these types of rides are on offer all over the country, but principally in the Tatras at Zakopane.  Visit Warsaw's reconstructed Old Town  Although much of it was destroyed during World War II, the Polish capital of Warsaw still deserves your attention. The Old Town was so masterfully reconstructed from original plans and paintings from the 17th and 18th centuries that it's hard to believe it's just a half a century old when you stroll its quaint cobbled streets. For an unforgettable view of the city, take a lift to the observation deck atop the Palace of Culture and Science, one of Warsaw's architectural icons.  Visit the Icon of the Black Madonna  The Icon of the Black Madonna, also known as the miraculous painting of Our Lady, can be seen in the huge Jasna Góra monastery complex at Czestochowa, 100km (60 miles) north of Cracow. It is reputed to have been painted by St Luke.  Visit the Old City of Zamość  The Renaissance-style market square in Zamość with its almost perfectly preserved 16th-century town centre is just one of the many designated UNESCO World Heritage sites in Poland. The stunning Old City was built by architect Bernando Morando, who followed Italian models of the 'ideal city'.  Visit the house of Poland's greatest composer Chopin  The manor house where the famous Polish composer Frederic Chopin was born in Żelazowa Wola, 53km (33 miles) west of Warsaw, makes for a great day trip. Attractions include attractive gardens, summertime recitals and 19th-century instruments and furniture used by the great man.  Wander the medieval town of Toruń  The medieval walled town of Toruń is one of Poland's best sights. The well-preserved Gothic treasure straddling the mighty Vistula river is made up of quaint cobbled streets, redbrick houses and old fortifications. Also Copernicus was born here, as was the special pierniki gingerbread loved throughout Poland.  Wander the pretty town of Wrocław  Known as Breslau in German and long a part of the German Empire, Wrocław is a diverse city. Visually, it's unique, with some 100 bridges crossing canals or connecting the city's many islands. Important sights include the 15th-century town hall, now the City Historical Museum, the giant Racławice Panorama, and the cathedral on Ostrów Tumski (Cathedral Island).",europe,,
indonesia,"Spread across the equator, Indonesia is a series of emerald jewels scattered across a broad expanse of tropical sea. This is one of the world's great adventures in waiting - hidden away in dense jungles on secret islands are tribes still living in isolation from the modern world and animals hardly known to science.      Indonesia is the fourth most populous nation on Earth with an incredible legacy of people, culture and geography just waiting to be explored. This archipelago boasts more than 18,000 islands, from tiny islets not much bigger than a palm tree to rugged expanses of land like Borneo, shared with the Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak.      Many visitors come specifically to seek out their own island paradise, complete with white-sand beaches, swaying palms and emerald waters. Below the waters, there are some of the world's best dive sites, swarming with huge sunfish, giant rays, sharks, porpoises, turtles and a blindingly colourful array of tropical fish.      For others, the attraction is cultural. A fascinating range of civilisations has developed across these tropical islands, from animist tribes in remote jungle villages to the elaborate Hindu kingdoms of Bali and Java. In Indonesia, timeless temples jostle for space with golden-domed mosques and beach resorts crowded with sun-seekers and surfers. The surf resort of Kuta in Bali has become one of the world's favourite tropical escapes, and the beach parties rave through till dawn every day of the week.      Those in search of a real escape can venture to the volcanic islands that drift eastwards towards Australia. There are towering volcanoes to be climbed, national parks to be explored and tropical rainforests to be trekked. You might even get lucky and meet a babirusa endemic to Sulawesi or the world's largest living reptile on the island of Komodo, home to the eponymous Komodo dragon.      Best of all, flights and ferries link all of the major islands, so you can island-hop right across the archipelago, stopping only when you find your own perfect piece of Southeast Asia.","Indonesia  Attractions in Indonesia  Bali: see Indonesia's Hindu side  Despite decades of tourist development, Bali remains a vision of tropical beauty. Take your pick from stunning beaches, jungle-covered volcanoes, surf spots in Kuta or Hindu temples harking back to the earliest civilisations on the Indonesia archipelago. The Balinese people are famously warm and friendly, perhaps the best part of a visit here. Fascinating Hindu temples include Pura Besakih and Pula Tanah Lot.  Bali: watch the waves break over Tanah Lot  Travel to the Tanah Lot, meaning 'Land in the Sea', on the west coast of Bali (a short drive from Kediri), for one of the most photogenic sights in Indonesia. Perched high on the rock formation is a Balinese temple (pura), which was built to worship the Sea God (Bhatara Segara). Sea snakes are believed to be living at the base of the rock, guarding the temple from evil intruders.  Banda Islands: from spices to marine life  Banda Islands were once the beating heart of the lucrative spice trade. Today the plantations are gone, but Banda and the neighbouring pristine Lucipara Atoll remain fantastic diving hotspots. Seeing large schools of dolphins and whales frolicking in the water while sailing along is almost guaranteed.  Borobudur: be bowled over  Indonesia is studded with the ruins of ancient civilisations, but perhaps the grandest of all is mighty Borobudur, a 9th-century Buddhist temple rising above the plains of central Java. Topped by hundreds of perforated stupas, the temple is a representation of the Buddhist universe, and its walls are covered in intricately carved 1,460 narrative relief panels.  Bunaken and Lembeh: experience a beautiful underwater world  Indonesia's coastline contains a vast array of teeming coral reefs, providing spectacular opportunities for scuba diving and snorkelling. In North Sulawesi, the best diving spots include Bunaken National Marine Park and Lembeh Island, where a mindboggling 300 types of coral and 3,000 species of fish can be discovered beneath crystal-clear waters.  Climb volcanos in Indonesia  Dozens of volcanoes soar above the landscape of Indonesia, and many can be climbed on jungle treks. Popular volcanoes include:    • Bali: Guning Agung, Gunung Batur    • Java: Gunung Bromo, Guning Ijen, Gunung Merbabu, Gunung Merapi, Gunung Semeru    • West Nusa Tenggara: Guning Rinjani (Lombok), Gunung Kelimutu, Gunung Tambora  Derawan Islands: meet stingless jellyfish   An exotic array of 31 stunning islands on the eastern coast of Kalimantan, Derawan is part of the Coral Triangle, an area known for containing some of the most extensive marine biodiversity in the world. Kakaban Island is probably the most famous as its large lake (makes up almost two-thirds of the island) is filled with stingless jellyfish. Due to being confined to the lake with no predators to worry about, these jellyfish have lost their natural defences.  Flores: see the three coloured lakes  The most famous tourist attraction in Flores is the Kelimutu volcano and its lakes. The colour of each lake changes daily, varying from blue, green, red to dark brown. This phenomenon is caused by volcanic vents interacting with minerals in the water and pushing the denser water to the surfaces.  Gili Islands: unwind in paradise   Just off the northwestern tip of Lombok Island, these three alluring islands (Gili Trawangan, Gili Meno and Gili Air) boast deep-water coral reefs, beachfront bungalows and miles of white sand. It is easy to find a quiet spot to unwind, but if you need more action, all-night dance parties are available on Gili Trawangan.  Istiqlal Mosque: the largest mosque in Southeast Asia  The modern Istiqlal Mosque in Jakarta is the largest mosque in Southeast Asia with room to accommodate up to 120,000 worshippers. It is the national mosque for the entire archipelago and a monumental piece of modern architecture. Non-Muslim visitors are welcome and guides will show you around the complex.  Java: see a traditional puppet show  Puppetry is a rich tradition in Indonesia, and marionette shows are still a vibrant part of the culture. You can see shows throughout Java, where intricately carved wayang golak and wayang kulit puppets act out stories based on well-known legends from Indonesia history; performances can sometimes last all night.  Kalimantan: meet the old men of the forest  Kalimantan, the Indonesian portion of the island of Borneo, is one of the last few refuges of the endangered orang-utan, whose name literally means 'man of the forest'. Visit any of the four national parks in Kalimantan for a near guarantee to see free-roaming orang-utans. The national parks are Betung Kerihun, Gunung Palung, Kutai and Tanjung Puting.  Karimunjawa (Karimun Jawa) Islands  A scattering of 27 coral-fringed islands in the calm Java Sea, Karimunjawa (Karimun Jawa) is a designated marine national park protecting five different ecosystems: coral reef, seagrass, seaweed, mangrove forest and low-land tropical forest. It is one of the best places to swim and snorkel in Indonesia.  Komodo island: see the world's largest lizards   Komodo and the Rinca islands are home to a living legend – the Komodo dragon, the world's largest lizard and a close relative of the dinosaurs. Komodo Dragons can grow up to 3m (10ft) in length and weigh up to 70kg, and you can see them close up at Komodo National Park. But don't get too close – humans have been injured and worse by dragons in the past.  Mahakam River: paddle through tropical scenery  The great Mahakam River in Kalimantan, Borneo, is feed by a network of jungle rivers running from the mountainous interior to the coast. Starting from the port city of Samarinda, tours follow the river deep into the jungle, where tribal communities live in villages of traditional longhouses and have largely preserved their traditions.  Prambanan: admire the spires  In the Special Region of Yogyakarta in Central Java, the Prambanan Temples form the largest Hindu temple site in Indonesia, constructed around the 9th century AD. The compound was deserted soon after it was completed, possibly due to the eruption of nearby Mount Merapi, but the temples have been impressively restored. This UNESCO World Heritage Site is dominated by the imposing spires of the Brahma Temple, the Vishnu Temple and the Shiva Temple.  Samosir: seek the Toba Batak culture  Samosir is an inhabited island in the middle of Lake Toba, located on the island of Sumatra. The island is the heart of the Toba Batak culture - learn to dance the Tor Tor, check out handwoven Ulos textile and enjoy a bowl of Mie Gomak (curry noodles) are some of the must-dos in Samosir.  Sulawesi: roam the rainforest  Gorgeous Sulawesi is a land of high mountains, misty valleys, hidden lakes, tribal villages and fascinating national parks. On land, top sights include Bantimurung Nature Park, home to thousands of exotic butterflies, and the hot springs at Lahendong and Leilem. Offshore, diving on Sulawesi's coral reefs is the main attraction.  Surfing in Indonesia  Spectacular waves break all around the islands of Indonesia, providing a watery playground for surfers. The best surf spots are:    • Aceh: Simeulue    • Bali: Uluwatu, Nusa Lembongan    • Java: Banyuwangi and Pacitan (East Java), as well as Panaitan and Sukabumi (West Java)    • Papua: Tanjung Saruri    • Sumatera: Nias (North Sumatera), Mentawai (West Sumatera)    • West Nusa Tenggara: Bang-Bangko (Desert Point) in Lombok and Sumbawa Island    • Yogyakarta: Wediombo  The Tropical Rainforest Heritage of Sumatra  Made of up three national parks (Gunung Leuser, Kerinci Seblat and Barisan Selatan), the Tropical Rainforest Heritage of Sumatra is one of the biggest conservation areas in Southeast Asia. Covering 2.5 million hectares (6.5 million acres), the area is home to an estimated 10,000 plant species, 200 mammal species and some 580 bird species. Spend a few weeks trekking through the lush rainforest is an essential Indonesia experience.  Torajaland: meet the tribal people  Torajaland, known as the 'Land of the Heavenly Kings', on Sulawesi, is one of the best places to encounter Indonesia's fascinating tribal culture. Toraja villagers live in dramatic buffalo horn-shaped wooden stilt houses and still practice the custom of burying their dead in vertical cliffside tombs, with rituals that include feasts for the mummified remains.  Ujong Kulon National Park: spot a rare rhino  The elusive and highly endangered Javan rhino still survives in the remote swamps of isolated Ujung Kulon National Park at the extreme westernmost tip of Java. The best way to explore is by a dugout canoe, and hopefully you can spot a rare rhino.  Yogyakarta: see how the sultan lives  Yogyakarta in Central Java was home to the Mataram Kingdom that produced the stunning temples of Borobudur and Prambanan. Today, it is the only Indonesian royal city still ruled by a Sultan, who and his family still live in the Kraton (Sultan's Palace) or the Palace of Yogyakarta, a masterpiece of understated Javanese architecture.",asia,,
luxembourg,"As the wealthiest nation in Europe and one of the founding fathers of the EU, it’s safe to say little Luxembourg is punching well above its weight.      But as well as the highest per capita income on the continent, this diminutive country also has more than its fair share of natural beauty with rolling hills, verdant valleys and meandering rivers painting picture of rural idyll.      Proud of its role as a founding member of the EU, Luxembourg plays a prominent position in European affairs and is home to a number of European Union institutions.      Most of the action takes place in the capital, Luxembourg City, which has something of a split personality: while it’s all antiquated charm in the Old Town, with its elegant squares, imposing churches, independent shops and cobblestone streets, the Kirchberg district has a modern, flashier feel thanks to its ubiquitous offices, shopping malls and entertainment complexes.      The most popular destination outside the capital is medieval Vianden in the northeast, with its cobbled streets and hilltop castle, which is the envy of many European cities. Vianden also hosts a range of festivals and events throughout the year, many of which celebrate its historical past.      Echternach, founded in the 7th century, is the oldest city in the country, with a picturesque centre dominated by an abbey. It is also a convenient base for exploring ‘Little Switzerland’, a tiny region of rocky outcrops, cliffs, cascades, and forests, crisscrossed by walking trails that are a haven for hikers and mountain-bikers.      On the southeastern border with Germany, the Moselle Valley enjoys a unique microclimate that has given rise to one of Europe’s smallest wine-growing districts, producing award-winning whites and sparkling wines. Meanwhile, northern Luxembourg is dominated by the Ardennes, an area of high plateau where wooded valleys, shimmering rivers and lofty peaks make for stunning trekking.       All in all, not bad for a country the size of Dorset.","Luxembourg  Attractions in Luxembourg  Ardennes  Explore the scenic beauty and quiet of the Ardennes region, referred to locally as Eisléck. The area consists of forested plateaux, wooded hills and lush valleys. Head for the small town of Esch-sur-Sûre, a well-known resort surrounded by the River Sûre (Sauer).  Breweries  Visit breweries and sample more of the region's alcoholic produce in the towns of Bascharage and Wiltz, or arrange an overnight stay in the Béierhaascht brewery hotel, also in Bascharage.  Clervaux  In the medieval market town of Clervaux, visit the 12th-century castle - now home to government offices, the tourist office, a small war museum on the 1944-1945 Ardennes offensive (the famous 'Battle of the Bulge'), and a renowned collection of documentary art photography, the Family of Man, by Edward Steichen (note: the latter is closed until 2013 for essential renovation work).  Echternach  Further east, in the town of Echternach, see a colourful religious dancing procession, which takes place annually on Whit Tuesday, attracting pilgrims from the world over. The town's seventh century Benedictine Abbey (now housing a museum) and St Willibrord's Basilica are well worth visiting, as is the distinctive 15th-century town hall.  Galleries and museums  Get cultural in the capital's numerous galleries and museums. Highlights include the National Museum of Natural History, the National Museum of History and Art and the Museum of the City of Luxembourg.  Luxembourg City  Wine and dine al fresco in Luxembourg City's charming main square, the Place d'Armes. The area known as the Grund, near the River Alzette, also has many lively cafes and restaurants; it can be reached via a lift down through the ancient rock.  Luxembourg City old town  Discover the delightful old centre of the capital, Luxembourg City. See the grand squares and winding, cobblestone streets. Visit the underground tunnels, known as casemates, and hop on the special open-air tourist train through the Pétrusse Valley. See the changing of the guard at the Palais Grand Ducal, the Grand Duke's official residence, which can also be toured in July and August. Other attractions in the city include the Place Guillaume II (also called Knuedler), its twice-weekly market (Wednesday and Saturday); and the 17th-century Notre Dame Cathedral.  Müllerthal  Tramp around the Müllerthal region (www.mullerthal.lu/en), Luxembourg's 'Little Switzerland'. Dense forests, crystal-clear brooks and spectacular rock formations combine to make this one of the country's most popular areas for walking and hiking. The main resorts are Berdorf, Beaufort and Larochette. The latter two both have medieval castles.  Plateau du Kirchberg  Head for the modern district on the Plateau du Kirchberg (reached via the Pont Grand Duchesse Charlotte - the capital's most impressive bridge); it's home to a thriving international finance centre, many European institutions and Luxembourg's biggest cinema complex and shopping mall.  Rock climbing  Harness up and go rock climbing; there are some good ascents and facilities available near Berdorf in the Müllerthal region.  Schengen  Visit the small village of Schengen, where the Moselle marks the meeting of three countries (Luxembourg, France and Germany), which has become internationally known after the 'Schengen Agreement' was signed here in 1995.  Thermal health treatments  Pamper yourself with thermal health treatments, and enjoy the sports and leisure facilities in the spa town of Mondorf-les-Bains.  Upper Sûre National Park  Splash out on some water sports: located within the Upper Sûre National Park (an area of outstanding beauty) is the country's drinking water reservoir, where a barrage dam (the Staudamm) has created a beautiful lake.  Vianden  In Vianden, be impressed by a magnificent castle, built between the 11th and 14th centuries and restored in the 20th century. The castle overlooks the town from a rocky perch. For a bird's-eye view, ride the chairlift to the viewing platform on the hillside, 450m (1,476ft) above both castle and town. Another equally impressive castle can be visited at Bourscheid, around 10km (7 miles) from Vianden.  Wine-tasting tour  Indulge yourself in a wine-tasting tour in the southeast. The River Moselle flows through Luxembourg's main wine-producing region (referred to as 'the Moselle' or d'Musel), and a number of the larger wineries offer tours of their cellars (caves), usually for a small fee, with tasting included. Smaller wineries welcome visitors, but require advance appointments for practical purposes. Boat-cruises on the river are also available (www.visitmoselle.lu).",europe,,
angola,"Its name may be synonymous with strife, but since the civil war ended in 2002 Angola has been enjoying something of a renaissance. Safe and welcoming, this friendly nation transports the laidback, community-orientated lifestyle of southern Portugal to continental Africa – and travellers are once again discovering its charms.      Most enter the country via the capital, Luanda, which has the dubious and surprising distinction of being the most expensive city in the world. With its gleaming skyscrapers, grand government buildings and palm-lined promenades, downtown Luanda’s prosperity probably comes as a revelation to many visitors. But the spoils of Angola’s considerable oil wealth soon give way to unofficial shantytowns, proving that not everyone is benefitting from the black gold rush.      It is along Angola’s stunning 1,700 km (1,000 mile) coastline, in cities like Luanda, where Portugal’s colonial influences are most striking. The faded, art deco splendour of cities like Benguela and Namibe provide a welcome distraction from the country’s sandy shores.      Further inland, the landscape becomes one of almost endless plains. Here remote national parks are slowly being restocked with wildlife, while the newly renovated Benguela railway wends through the seemingly endless countryside. One of the world’s most evocative rail journeys, riding through the landscape with its people is a great way to delve into the psyche of laughter loving Angolans.      To the north – and separated from the rest of Angola by a 40 km (25 mile) arm of the Democratic Republic of Congo – the exclave of Cabinda is Angola in miniature, with empty beaches once popular with expats, elegant towns and virgin rainforest full of wildlife.      Youthful and energetic, Angola, like its people, has its own way of doing things. Fun-loving and eager to impress, it is a country still shaking off its troubled past while looking firmly at the future.","Angola  Attractions in Angola  Be enraptured by Kalandula falls  Witness the impressive spectacle of the Kalandula Waterfalls, one of the largest by volume anywhere in Africa. Located in the country's north, the falls are spread along 400m (1,312ft) and fall over 100m (328ft) from forested clifftops. The views are particularly mighty at the end of the rainy season when the Lucala River that feeds them is in full flood.  Echo the actions of the early explorers  It was at Soyo that the Portuguese explorer Diogo Cao was the first European to set foot on land in what is now Angola and placed a stone padrao (or standard). Five centuries on, the padrao still stands on the tip of a beautiful peninsula which is also home to sea turtles.  Explore the coastal forts  The many forts that dot Angola's coastline give a real sense of the country's history as a Portuguese colony. The largest and most famous is Luanda's Fort Sao Miguel, built in 1576 to protect the fledgling city and serve as a slave depot. It now contains the Museum of the Armed Forces.  Grab a towel and head for the beach  Palmeirinhas beach offers magnificent scenery and a long, deserted beach approximately 45 km (28 miles) south of Luanda, while in the opposite direction Santiago beach is known for its fishing. To swim, the beaches of Luanda's Ilha peninsula are a better bet, and just five minutes from the capital's heart.  Head out on safari  Kissama (or Quiçama) National Park is currently the only functioning national park in the whole country, and is within easy reach of Luanda. Thanks to a reintroduction programme, the park is home to an increasing variety of wild animals, including elephants and the rare black palanca antelope, which can only be found in Angola.  Relax in Benguela  Less frenetic than the capital, Benguela maintains its cool colonial charm, making the most of its bay side location. The Governor's Palace, facing the long sandy beach, is one of the best examples of colonial architecture in the country, while plenty of public spaces provide shade for taking in the sights and sounds.  Ride the rails  The newly refurbished Benguela railway follows an old trade route inland to the Democratic Republic of Congo. Comprising 67 stations and 42 bridges, it is one of the longest rail journeys in Africa, and a great way to see Angola's hinterland while interacting with its people.  Take in the view at Tundavala Gap  To the south of Angola, close to the city of Lubango, lies Tundavala Gap. Views extend for miles from among the rim of cliffs known as the Serra da Leba escarpment, which marks the end of the Bié plateau that divides Angola into high and lowland.  Take the capital to heart  Ever improving Luanda deserves more than just a quick rest stop on arrival from the international airport. It's the city's atmosphere that draws you in, with a pleasant Atlantic Ocean location and historic churches and architectural gems lining almost every street of the lower city. One of the more curious attractions is the towering Mausoleum of Agostinho Neto, the country's first president: love it or hate it, you can't ignore it.  Understand Angola’s tragic slave past  Gain a historical understanding into Angola's role in the Atlantic Slave Trade at the Museum of Slavery, 25 km (16 miles) along the coast from Luanda. The museum is located near a 17th-century chapel in which slaves were baptised before boarding ships for the New World.",africa,,
north korea,"Perhaps the world's most insular, provocative and challenging country, North Korea is hardly the archetype of an alluring holiday destination. Yet more and more foreigners are signing up for tours of the socialist state. The reason? There's simply nowhere else on Earth quite like it.  North Korea – or the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) – is a totalitarian socialist state with an elaborate cult of personality built around the Kim dynasty.  Its isolation and ideology means that independent travel is impossible. Instead, there are a number foreign agencies that offer tours of the country with government-approved guides, regaling sightseers with propaganda-skewed tales of local history, while steering them clear of interaction with the general public.  All approved tours begin and end in the country's capital, Pyongyang. A city of more than 2.5 million inhabitants, the long working hours and strict curfew can often make it appear empty – yet there's an abundance of socialist sites for the foreign visitor to enjoy.  Highlights include the flame-topped Juche Tower (a monument to the state's socialist ideology), the Mansudae Grand Monument (bronze statues of former leaders Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il) and USS Pueblo (an American ship captured in 1968 and now on permanent display).  Beyond the capital most excursions include visits to Myohyang-san (a mountain with a palace carved into it), Panmunjom (the tense military border between North and South Korea) and Mangyongdae (a North Korean village said to be the birthplace of Kim Il-sung).  And then there's the food. Sharing a culinary heritage with South Korea, the North boasts a similar smorgasbord of delicacies, offering visitors an authentic taste of this most inauthentic of countries.  North Korea might not be the most easygoing destination, but if you can accept its tyrannical leadership and take everything you are told with a pinch of salt, there are plenty of incredible experiences to be had in the world's most mysterious country.","North Korea  Attractions in North Korea  Climb the Tower of the Juche Idea  Rising high across the Taedong River from the Kim Il-Sung Square, this flame-topped tower represents the national socialist ideology of Juche, often translated as 'Self-Reliance'. The tower is made of over 25,000 granite blocks and stretches 170m (557ft) into the Pyongyang sky. A trip to the top by lift (ideally early in the morning) offers a fine view over the capital.  Drop in on embalmed dictators at Kumsusan Palace  A decadent mausoleum for two communist leaders, Kumsusan Palace of the Sun displays the embalmed bodies of both Kim Il-sung, founder and 'Eternal President' of North Korea, and his son and successor Kim Jong-il. Built in 1976, this gigantic grey palace is surrounded by a large square and a moat. Foreign visitors are only permitted twice a week, but most tours include a visit.  Enjoy a rare slice of ancient history at Taedongmun  A rare historic monument in an overwhelmingly-20th century city, Taedongmun is the eastern gate of what was once an inner defensive wall of Pyongyang castle. The construction dates from 1635, though it sits on the site of an original 6th century gate. It is one of North Korea's few protected historical structures.  Escape to the country in Kumgangsan  Kumgangsan, or Diamond Mountain, is perhaps the most famous mountain in North Korea, rising over 1,630m (5,347m). It is part of the country's largest national park, consisting of a range of mountains along the east coast of the country. Its unspoilt, diverse environment is popular with birdwatchers, photographers and botanists.  Explore Pyongyang Film Studios  These film studios, in the suburbs of Pyongyang, produce multiple films per year. While most focus on North Korean victories over the Japanese and the Americans, there's also been the occasional Western (a popular genre with Kim Jong-il). Any visit here includes exploring the sets used for historic films, including a Japanese street and some European-style buildings.  Have a look inside Myohyangsan Mountain  Myohyangsan, which means 'exotic fragrant mountain', offers pleasant walks and climbs through a contrasting scenery of waterfalls, woods and Buddhist pagodas. But it's what is underneath the mountain that's most impressive. Miles of corridors and rooms carved into the mountain display thousands of gifts presented by foreigners to Kim Il-sung and his son.  Hit the slopes at Masikryong Ski Resort  North Korea's only ski resort, Masikryong sits at the summit of the 1,360m (4,462ft) Taehwa Peak and offers a quiet and peaceful skiing experience during winter. That's because the vast complex, consisting of nine runs spread over an area 940 square miles (plus a luxury hotel, an ice rink, a swimming pool and multiple restaurants) struggles to pull in the locals.  Keep an open mind at Mangyongdae  Located just outside the capital, and a popular destination with tour groups, Mangyongdae is the supposed birthplace of Kim Il-sung. Visitors will find rows of humble huts and barns that are said to have played host to the Great Leader's early years (although most appear to have been built far more recently). There is also a museum and – rather unexpectedly – a funfair.  Learn about Korean mythology at Chollima Statue  Located just north of the Mansudae Grand Monument, this bronze sculpture is a fascinating mix of Communist ideology and traditional Korean mythology. It depicts a noble, socialist man and woman gloriously riding a Chollima – a mythical Korean steed (akin to Pegasus) that could cover hundreds of miles per day and was considered untameable.  Listen to propaganda aboard USS Pueblo  One of the regime's most treasured possessions, this captured US warship (or intelligence ship, depending on who you believe) is moored on Pyongyang's Potong River as a museum ship. Visitors will undertake a guided tour of the ship and watch a propaganda video of the ship's capture, the 'humane' release of its crew and the significance of North Korea's victory.  Peer across the border at Panmunjom  This heavily-guarded post on the border between the two Koreas is on the agenda of even the most whistle-stop tours. Visitors will learn (one side of) the story of the Korean War and will be taken into the Armistice Talks Hall where peace was brokered between North and South Korea. Expect to be watched at all times by the wary American troops across the border.  Roam the foothills of Paekdusan  Paekdu, on the Chinese-North Korean border, is the peninsula's highest mountain, at 2,744m (9,002ft). It also has great geological significance (as an extinct volcano with one of the world's deepest crater lakes) and mythical status (it is, according to local mythology, the birthplace of the first Korean kingdom). As a visitor, the surrounding natural beauty – forest, waterfalls, streams and abundant wildlife – is also rather special.  Take in the vastness of Kim Il-sung Square  Pyongyang's main square periodically plays host to North Korea's huge military parades. But even when it isn't, it's a worth visiting for the imposing concrete buildings surrounding the square. Take a trip inside the Grand People's Study House (home to an extensive local library collection) and the Korean National Art Gallery (home to the country's best socialist realist art).  Visit old town Kaesong  Many ancient buildings in Kaesong, capital of the peninsula during the Koryo Dynasty, bear witness to Korea's long imperial history. Highlights include; Sonjuk Bridge, a small stone structure dating back to 1216; the 14th century tombs of King Kongmin and his Mongolian queen; and the traditional Korean old town with original Joseon-period buildings.  Walk under the Arch of Triumph  Marking the precise spot where Kim Il-sung first addressed the Korean people after the end of the Japanese occupation in 1945, Pyongyang's giant triumphal arch is, quite deliberately, ever-so-slightly taller than its famous cousin in Paris.  Witness the vanity of Mansudae Grand Monument  Unveiled in 1972 to celebrate the 60th birthday of president Kim Il-sung, this gigantic bronze statue on a hill in Pyongyang is venerated by North Koreans. Foreign tour groups are routinely requested to bow in front of statue and present flowers at its feet. Since 2012, Kim Il-sung has been accompanied by an equally-enormous statue of Kim Jong-il.",asia,,
victoria,"Victoria is Australia in miniature: the state crams snow-capped mountain country, epic seascapes, wineries, rainforests and the country's largest inland waterway into its modest borders. Not to mention, of course, the eminently lovable metropolis that is Melbourne. The state capital famously has an intense rivalry with Sydney, but even a few New South Welshmen would concede Melbourne’s claim to being Australia's cultural capital.      The city – chock-full of galleries, heritage architecture, museums, sporting events and festivals – has a distinct set of passions, from Aussie Rules football (known universally as “footie”) to top-tier gastronomy. It’s no exaggeration, in fact, to state that Melbourne now stands as a world-class food destination, a status stoked by its vivid multiculturalism.      But you won’t need to travel far from the city to experience what else Victoria has to share. Natural features come big and bold down here, from the Great Ocean Road (considered to be one of the best scenic drives in Australia) to the Grampians. The wildlife roster, meanwhile, makes space for wombats, wallabies, emus and everything in between.      Referred to as the Garden State, Victoria ripples with rolling hills and meandering valleys – its mountains offer some of the best winter sports in the country – but the state as a whole is also somewhere rich in human history. From the age-old beliefs of the original landowners and the derring-do tales of Ned Kelly to the stirring legacy of the Gold Rush era and the pioneering winemakers of Milawa, the destination holds real rewards for those who travel beyond Melbourne and its surrounds.","Victoria  Attractions in Victoria  Aussie Rules  Learn to kick the leather off an Australian Rules or 'Aussie Rules' football.

cameroon,"While referring to Cameroon as “Africa in miniature” has become a bit of a cliché, this statement certainly rings true: everything you would expect from the African continent seems to be consolidated here, in this enticing and eclectic land.      The beautiful south is characterised by tropical rainforests and deserted golden beaches, which would be chock full of bathers in a more developed destination. There’s a hearty appetite for independence in the English-speaking south, but, despite the best efforts of local pressure groups, it has yet to break free from the rest of the country.      In contrast to the south, the dramatic landscapes of northern Cameroon are dominated by great expanses of desert, lakes and savannah. Traditional villages still cling on in this unforgiving land, which is perhaps the most culturally diverse region in Cameroon, home as it is to some 50 ethnic groups. Though largely peaceful, the region has been rocked by attacks from extremists in recent years. Keep abreast of the latest news.      Pack your hiking gear if you’re heading to western Cameroon, which is dominated by volcanic mountains. Looking out across these rugged ranges you could be forgiven for thinking you were on Mars, such is their otherworldly appearance. It’s not all about the landscapes, though. Scattered across the country are a handful of game reserves, which offer ample opportunity to observe impressive wildlife, including elephants and lions.      Cameroon really should be one of Africa’s leading destinations, but poverty blights much of its infrastructure, meaning transport and accommodation are chronically underdeveloped. Outstanding border disputes haven’t helped, either – travellers are advised to steer clear of the frontiers with Nigeria, Chad and the Central African Republic, which are considered unstable.        Aside from certain no-go areas, Cameroon has much to offer adventurous travellers. From its verdant rainforests to its iconic wildlife, the country is bursting with life. Go and you shall be handsomely rewarded.","Cameroon  Attractions in Cameroon  Drive through the central highlands  Hop in a 4-wheel drive and explore the splendid scenery of the central highlands. Starting in Douala, the drive to Nkongsamba rises to reveal vibrant, verdant valleys and breath-taking waterfalls. As dusk falls, ready the camera to capture the striking orange and purple skylines.  Find colonial architecture in Foumban  In this culture-rich town, discover many traditional buildings dating from Cameroon's period of German colonisation. Completed in 1917, a beautiful Sultan's Palace contains a museum on King Ibrahim Njoya, whilst nearby the Musée du Palais, the Musée des Arts et des Traditions Bamoun and the market are all well worth a visit.  Go on a gorilla safari in Lobéké National Park  Lobéké National Park is home to elusive families of western lowland gorillas. For the best chance of viewing these graceful giants, visitors can spend the night in a specially built watchtower. Equally exciting but easier to spot are elephants, buffalo and the giant forest hog, though visitors should keep their eyes peeled for red river hogs and bongo antelope.  Learn about the local fauna at Limbé  This pleasant port town (formerly Victoria) boasts a beautiful botanical garden. Founded in 1892 by Cameroon's German colonisers, the gardens were originally set up to trial exotic crops such as coffee, cocoa and rubber. Today, conservation is at the heart of the scent-filled gardens, which offer trails and insights into Cameroonian botanic culture.  Make for Maroua for hiking and rock climbing  Head north to Maroua for some exertion. Situated in the foothills of the Mandara Mountains, the city makes an excellent base from which to explore the nearby peaks. Lower reaches offer moderate hiking trails and fine views whilst Le Dent de Mindif, south of the city, is a highly regarded rock climbing spot.  Reserve some time for nature spotting  Head to Cameroon's northern reaches to see monkeys, snuffling warthogs and an abundance of antelope in the Kalamaloué Reserve. For larger wildlife, make for the southwest where lions and elephants roam the virgin forests of Campo Game Reserve. Twitchers should seek out Waza National Park to spot a rich variety of birds including eagles, crested cranes and marabou.  Scale an active volcano  At 4,095m (13,435ft) Mount Cameroon is the highest mountain in West Africa and Africa's highest active volcano, making it a popular destination for mountaineers. Make your base Buea, a pretty colonial town complete with Cameroon's first post office. From here, the climb takes three to four days.  Spot the rare black rhino in Bouba Ndjidah National Park  Situated on the banks of Mayo Lidi River, in the far north of the country, this park is a popular location to see lions, elephants, élan and buffalo. Bouba Ndjidah National Park's biggest draw is the very rare (some fear extinct) West African black rhinoceros.  Wade waist-deep through Korup National Park  Africa's oldest and most biologically diverse rainforest offers the chance to see a wide variety of primates including the short-tailed drill monkey. Ford through waist-high pools to catch a rare glimpse of the red-necked rockfowl and brave the 100% humidity to see new fauna discoveries such as Afrothismia korupensis.   Wander the hills of Yaoundé  Straddling seven hills, Cameroon's bustling capital is pleasantly green. On top of Mont Fébé sits the Benedictine Monastery's Musée d'Art Cameroonais, which houses traditional arts and crafts including an enviable collection of masks. The newer National Museum of Yaoundé is also worthy of a visit. Make the most of the exhibitions with a guided tour.  Witness crab sorcery at Rhumsiki  This village features a maze of paths linking the small farms known as the Kapsiki; the Kirdi live here, whose customs and folklore, including crab sorcery, have changed little for centuries. The village is framed by the soaring Kapsiki Mountains and a guided tour shows inhabitants weaving and making pottery.",africa,,
libya,"Travel to Libya is ill-advised at the moment due to the ongoing civil war. And that’s a shame, because this beautiful land has much to offer the intrepid traveller.      One of the largest countries in African, Libya boasts a stunning Mediterranean coastline, gorgeous desert landscapes and no fewer than seven UNESCO World Heritage Sites. These ancient sites are a reminder that Libya’s history has always been tumultuous: before Gaddafi’s regime and the ensuing civil war, the country endured Greek, Roman and Italian rule.      But Libya has more to offer than war stories. From the mystical desert town of Ghadames to the stunning Sahara Desert, this is a land of empty beaches, ancient mountain trails and shimmering oases. It is a land where sand dunes stretch to the heavens, palm trees reflect in desert lakes and prehistoric rock carvings decorate the dramatic Akakus Mountains.      Rural Libya is characterised by neatly cultivated olive groves, fat lemons dangling from trees and remote Berber settlements. In the cities, merchants sell wares in rose-scented souks, flogging silver, spices, henna, hijabs and Tuareg scarves. The smell of spicy lentil soup and Benghazi seafood hangs deliciously in the air.      The population of Libya is mostly of Arab and Berber descent. Berbers make up about 10% of inhabitants and live in more remote areas. The rest of the population lives largely in coastal cities like Tripoli and Benghazi, although recent fighting has forced many to flee.      Libyan hospitality is legendary and its people love showing travellers around. But tourism faltered after the Arab Spring and has been paralyzed by the ensuing Civil War. At the time of writing, tourist visas were not being issued and most tour companies have closed their doors – many guides now work as fixers for war reporters instead.      It’s impossible to say how current events will pan out, but, like many travellers, we hope the doors to Libya will swing open again soon.","Libya  Attractions in Libya  Akakus Mountains  The mountain scenery on the border with Algeria is spectacular but, as if that wasn't enough, these rock cliffs hide some of the Sahara's finest prehistoric rock art, particularly at Wadi Metkandoush and Wadi Tashwinat.  Ancient cities  Libya's coastline is dotted with some of the most spectacular ancient ruins in all of the Mediterranean. In most cases, the sites are well-preserved and best of all, you'll encounter very few tourists - that was the case even before the revolution. Leptis Magna, a short drive from Tripoli, is the most magnificent of all; its cobbled streets, Severan Arch (erected in honour of Emperor Septimus Severus), marble- and granite-lined Hadrianic Baths, detailed basilica and large amphitheatre are easily worth a day of your time. Cyrene, three hours from Benghazi, spills across the hilltop; check out its ancient fertility temples, beautiful Temple of Zeus and Roman stadium. Sabratha, between Tripoli and the Tunisia border, is also stunning. All three sites - and four more along the coast near Benghazi - closed their doors during the revolution, but you may be able to talk tour guides hanging around nearby into allowing you a visit.  Assai al-Hamra (Red Castle)  Tripoli's spectacular fortress houses a maze of courtyards and buildings, situated on a promontory above the city. The Jamahiriya Museum, which houses ancient artefacts, closed during the revolution, but there are plans for it to re-open.  Beaches  There isn't much of a beach culture in Libya; many local people prefer to go out for picnics in the countryside instead. This means you'll sometimes have the coastline's gorgeous golden sands to yourselves. With 2,000km (1,243 miles) of Mediterranean coastline, there is plenty of choice when it comes to splendid beaches, including Neqezzah (112km east of Tripoli), Ras al-Hammamah, Sabratha and the splendid beaches from Zuara to Ras al-Jadir.  Berber architecture  Berber villages are scattered throughout the more remote mountain area of the Jebel Nafousa, but the unusual mud-brick architecture of the Berber grain storage houses in Nalut, Kabaou and Kasr Elhaj is particularly interesting.  Camel riding  Several tour operators organise camel treks through the Akakus mountains or other parts of the Sahara. This is the true way to discover the quiet solitude, slowness and unique beauty of the desert.  Desert driving  There's nothing quite like riding in a 4WD across miles and miles of seemingly endless desert, climbing the ridges of enormous sand dunes and tumbling down them bare-footed. The best place for this kind of adventure is the amazing Great Sand Sea, about four hours drive from Benghazi. You can sleep overnight in a desert villa in the dusty town of Al Jaghbub, then visit nearby desert lakes before swanning off into the desert. The Great Sand Sea was once an ocean; you can still see the evidence of that, in the fossilised starfish, seashells and rock formations shaped by the waves and sand. Also worth looking out for are the ancient tombs (complete with bones), sun-dried palm groves and a collection of WWII-era British cars, left to rust between the dunes.  Dune-surfing  The dunes near the Ubari lakes are seriously high and a few snowboards are available nearby to surf down them. Beware it can be dangerous.  Freedom Square (Green Square)  Once a symbol of Gaddafi's regime, Tripoli's main square became famous during the 2011 revolution. It was here that Gaddafi vowed to fight against the uprising; it was here, too, that thousands gathered to usher in a new era after Tripoli finally fell. These days, most of the square is used as a car park for the nearby souk, but it's worth wandering around and absorbing the square's remarkable history.  Ghadames  Most travellers to Libya come back with rave reviews of Ghadames, saying it's like nowhere else on earth. The unique desert oasis town, known as the 'Pearl of the Desert', is in the western region, 800km (500 miles) southwest of Tripoli. The UNESCO-protected old town's unique architecture consists of whitewashed mud-brick walls, covered labyrinthine walkways and elaborate orchard gardens with date palms, pomegranate and orange trees and vegetables. Under the Gaddafi regime, people living in the ancient houses were offered new homes nearby, but the old buildings remain and are often frequented by the people of the town.  Leptis Magna  The incredible well-preserved ancient remains of a Roman settlement, highlights of which are the Severan Arch (erected in honour of Emperor Septimus Severus), the marble- and granite-lined Hadrianic Baths, the detailed basilica and the large amphitheatre.  Qasr Libya  About two and a half hours from Benghazi, Qasr Libya (Castle Libya) is often overlooked by travellers. But this dusty site houses an incredible collection of Byzantine mosaics that date back centuries. Colourful and well-kept, some are humorous, others poignant; together they illustrate the rich Byzantine culture.  Roman Libya  Roman cities are well-preserved in Libya but nowhere can you imagine just how good the Romans had it as in Villa Sileen. Come to the house late afternoon, after visiting Leptis Magna, and feel the sea breeze on the wonderful terrace.  Snorkelling  On the bay beneath Cyrene, the sun-dappled ruins of the port city of Apollonia are worth visiting in their own right. Crumbling roman theatres tumble down to the water and there's even the remnants of an ancient library and olive press. You can snorkel in the turquoise ocean, but you'll have to bring your own equipment and you may have to talk the guards of the nearby museum into turning a blind eye. There are shipwrecks off the coast that you may be able to explore as long as you are careful and respectful. Women may want to cover up in a t-shirt or wetsuit.  Souk shopping  The old souks and winding lanes of the capital, Tripoli, with its traditional mosques and khans (inns/warehouses), have particular streets given to spices, gold, bridal fabrics made from a desert plant and animal skins.  The Pentapolis  Of the five ancient and powerful Greek city states in Libya Cyrene, Sussa (Apollonia) and Tolmitha (Ptolemaeis) have the most atmospheric remains. The setting of Cyrenaica is particularly impressive in the Jebel al Akhdar overlooking the sea, and its museum is spectacular.  Trekking and caves  The pretty hills, rock formations and cooler climate of the Jebel al-Akhdar (Green Mountains) or the Jebel Nafusa in the west are ideal for trekking but you will have to work out your own routes as few tour companies organise walking trips. There are caves, ancient churches, olive groves and even some prehistoric caves to explore. Haua Fteah cave is a large shallow site a few kilometres from the town of Marsa Sousa, in the Jebel al-Akhdar. Archaeologists estimate that it dates back to about 100,000 years.  Ubari sand dunes & lakes  In Ubari, majestic sand dunes run down to picturesque salt lakes that are surrounded by palm trees. Locals, not that there are many around here, come to these lakes for salt-lake bathing, where a microscopic shrimp is believed to clean the skin, and rejuvenating mighty hot sand baths in an exotic setting.",africa,,
france,"You could spend a lifetime's worth of holidays in France and still feel as if you hadn't done the country justice. It remains one the planet's most visited tourist destination, meriting its standing with an almost overwhelming mass of historical treasures, storybook landscapes, and cultural idiosyncrasies.      The teeming glam of Paris makes for one hell of a centrepiece, matching any city on the planet for ambiance, individuality, and set-piece sights. But the real beauty of France, in many ways, lies elsewhere. The country's natural gifts are striking with white sandy beaches, hulking mountains and swathes of rolling countryside. It's a land that has inspired dreamers and drinkers, revolutionaries and artists.       You can soak up the A-list beaches of the Cote d’Azur, drowse in the timeless greenery of the Loire Valley or gaze up at the monumental peaks of the Alps. Wander the lavender fields of Provence, eat your way around the legendary bistros of Lyon or sample the rugged charm of Corsica. France's cities, coastline, and countryside all have their own endearing rewards, and when taken as a whole, they present a near-perfect visitor package.      That's not to say that France is somewhere easily bracketed. When you're walking the moody portside backstreets of Marseille or delving among the sprawling flea markets of Paris, it can be a job to remember that they're all part of the same country as the vineyards of Alsace and the sand dunes of the Atlantic coast.      This diversity, in many ways, is the magic of France. It's why countless magazines, books, and texts have dedicated their works to the joys of the French lifestyle. It's why the national spirit is well-known for its boldness and radiance. And it's one reason why, in a world full of historical wonder and natural beauty, France still draws more tourist attention than anywhere else.      ""How can one describe a country which has 246 kinds of cheese?"" once asked former French president Charles De Gaulle. Even today, it's a very good question.","France  Attractions in France  Alsace: drive along the superb Alsace wine route  There's no shortage of enjoyable French wine trails to explore, but the Route des Vins d’Alsace - a gloriously scenic 170km (106 miles) drive through the hushed, hilly countryside - is arguably the most atmospheric of the lot. Wine can be bought and tasted at roadside cellars. Alsace wines are predominantly white – the area's dry Rieslings are world-class.  Brittany: explore past and present  A region with a deeply individual character, Brittany blends a proud Celtic heritage with a trove of vibrant travel attractions, from prehistoric megaliths and lively port cities to dense forests and dramatic coastlines. Its still-keen sense of independence only adds to the overall ambience. The Breton language, while not widely spoken, is still very much in evidence.  Cannes: experience the film festival  The Côte d'Azur resort of Cannes bursts to life each spring when its iconic film festival comes to town. La Croisette, the town's seafront promenade, becomes an A-list parade of directors, producers and Hollywood actors, while yachts file along the harbour-side. Even if you don't bag a ticket for a screening, it's a spectacle.  Carcassonne: explore the charming town   Almost too picture-perfect to be true, the fortified town of Carcassonne is home to a wealth of monuments from different eras. Rising above the plains of the lower valley like some far-fetched storybook citadel, it's a favourite of history buffs. And with its current spread of restaurants, Carcassonne is an ideal destination for gastronomes too.  Chamonix: take to the peaks  A magnet for winter sports fans, summer hikers and serious climbers, Chamonix is France's mountain resort par excellence. In addition to the range of opportunities for physical activity, there are plenty of options for those more interested in enjoying the views. As backdrops go, the Mont Blanc Massif takes some beating.  Château de Versailles: revel in the opulence  The Palace of Versailles is a magnificent royal chateau that served as the centre of political power in pre-revolutionary France. Today, the super-sized and beautiful structure remains delicately preserved and represents a fascinating insight into the grand flavours and follies of its day. You'll find priceless artwork, regal luxury and flamboyant design at every turn.  Corsica: explore the rugged island   The island of Corsica is a wonder once visited, never forgotten. Ruffled with mountain ranges and edged by vertiginous cliffs, it's a place of rugged beauty and age-old heritage. Its hiking trails are among the most celebrated in Europe – particularly the world-famous GR20, a challenging long-distance trek through the hills.  French Alps: ski in a snowy wonderland   The French Alps play host to some of the most famed ski resorts in Europe, among them Courchevel, Val-d'Isère, Méribel and L'Alpe d'Huez. The region as a whole covers a colossal area and offers superb choices for skiers of all levels. At most resorts, the season runs from mid-December to April.  Gorges du Verdon: kayak across a vast river gorge   Considered by many to be the most impressive river gorge in Europe (others have it as France's answer to the Grand Canyon), the Gorges du Verdon reaches depths of up to 700m (2,297ft), with steep banks blanketed in greenery. Join a kayak tour to get onto the water.  Lascaux: see the caves art   Discovered by chance in 1940 by a group of teenagers, the cave paintings of Lascaux are considered to be among the world's best examples of prehistoric art. The 15,000-year-old images of bulls, horses and reindeer caused a visiting Pablo Picasso to proclaim, 'we have invented nothing'.  Loire Valley: cycle through the countryside   Is there a better way to take in the medieval chateaux and sparkling wine caves of the Loire region than on two wheels? The gentle pace of life here has drawn countless artists and writers over the years, and plenty of cyclists as well. Bike hire is easily arranged.  Lyon: lose yourself in this idyllic city   There's a great deal more to France's third-largest city than its fabled restaurant scene - although miss that at your peril, foodies.  When you aren't savouring the cuisine,  you'll discover the art museums, vibrant clubbing scene, riverside walks, and historic old town that make this city an alluring destination. Eurostar can whisk you there from London in five hours.  Marseille: feel the energy  Simmering with the colourful urban rhythms of the south, Marseille is a coastal city with a multi-layered history and a character that's part Provence, part North Africa. From the lively buzz of the daily portside fish market to the clamorous throng of its football crowds, it's a city with a boisterous, confident identity that remains very much its own.  Millau Viaduct: traverse the world's tallest bridge  Designed by British architect Norman Foster, the astonishing Millau Viaduct is today the tallest bridge in the world. Its modernist structure is made all the more impressive by its rural setting, spanning the valley of the River Tarn in the south. You'll need to pay a toll to cross by vehicle.  Normandy: cross to Mont Saint-Michel  Normandy's most iconic sight draws countless visitors yearly with its impossibly photogenic setting: Mont Saint-Michel (Saint Michael's Mount) is a rocky island surrounded by tidal waters 1km (0.6 miles) off the coast of Normandy. It was founded in 708 by the Bishop of Avranches, who built a chapel there after the Archangel Michael appeared to him in a dream.  Paris: sightsee to your heart’s content   Anywhere that boasts the Louvre, Eiffel Tower, the Arc de Triomphe, Sacré-Cœur, and Notre Dame Cathedral is more than just another city. Equal parts chic, edgy and drop-dead beautiful, Paris is always cosmopolitan, ever-changing, and unmissable.  Provence: discover the natural beauty  This long-eulogised region of southeast France is famed for its breathtaking countryside and its sense of romance, which combine to create one of the most magical corners of the nation. From medieval hilltop villages to purple fields of lavender, Provence is one of the country's most seductive destinations.  St Tropez: live the high life  Synonymous with glamour, glitz, and the various other trappings of the jet set, St Tropez was 'discovered' by Brigitte Bardot in the 1950s and has been a trendy holiday destination ever since. Over the summer months, shiny mega-yachts pack the town's marina, which sits on the gleaming Côte d'Azur.",europe,,
aruba,"Lean back and take it easy on Aruba, which combines the best that Caribbean sea, sand and sunshine have to offer. Aruba's balmy breezes and relaxed pace are just the tonic for any frazzled visitor; just like the soothing aloe vera plant that is found everywhere on the island.  The surrounding waters are populated by colourful creatures such as parrotfish splashed with teal and gold, while bright pink flamingos populate the national park. Aruba's capital, Oranjestad, also dazzles – it's great for shopping. Orange facades brightly array the architecture, indicating the island's historical ties with The Netherlands – Aruba's head of state is still the Dutch ruling monarch.  Favoured by Americans keen to escape extreme weather in winter, Aruba is one of the most popular touristic islands in the southern Caribbean. Sometimes the mob has it right. This island's beautiful beaches, pristine resorts and charming city of Oranjestad are difficult to knock. You'll also find a lively nighttime scene, with glittering casinos, gourmet restaurants and beach-side diners.  Many come on day-trips as part of a cruise, but it's really worth spending a bit more time in Aruba, soaking up its nature, all rugged coasts and gorgeous beaches. In the interior you'll find rocky deserts, expanses filled with cactuses and the iconic divi-divi tree. It's a good idea to hire a car to really make the most of it. Many tourists don't stray far from Oranjestad, but a drive to the northern and eastern shores comes highly recommended. Look out for the California Lighthouse and Seroe Colorado. Modern road signs are still being developed here, so try not to get lost.  As for history, Aruba's first inhabitants are thought to be Amerindians from the Arawak tribe. The island was later colonised by the Spanish, before being taken over by the Dutch in the 17th century. Today's Arubans are for the most part an interesting mix of Amerindian and European heritage, with the island boasting the strongest Arawak heritage in the region. There is also a considerable black population, as well as more recent Venezuelan immigrants. Altogether this makes for a lively local scene that's both welcoming and distinct.","Aruba  Attractions in Aruba  Climb Hooiberg  Shaped like a giant haystack, (hooiberg actually means ""haystack"" in Dutch), this volcano rises dramatically from Aruba's flat interior to the northwest of Santa Cruz. The 165m (541ft) summit is accessed via a series of steps and offers views across to Venezuela on clear days.  Enjoy the sights of Bubali Bird Sanctuary  You don't have to be a twitcher to appreciate Bubali Bird Sanctuary, which is home to herons, egrets, gulls, cormorants and many other species. Viewing platform have been erected throughout the park and provide excellent opportunities for birdwatching.  Explore the underwater world  A mecca for divers and snorkelers, Aruba has 40 dive sites where visitors can meet the local marine life or explore WWII wrecks. As well as stunning coral formations, bountiful marine life and sunken ships, visitors can enjoy excellent visibility in Aruba's crystalline waters.  Go wild at Arikok National Park  This enormous park covers one-fifth of the island's landmass and contains a multitude of plants and animals, including flamingos. The park as it's known today was only fully realised in 2000 and is striving to increase the work of conservation and education on Aruba.  Hit the beach  The question is: which one? Hadicurari Beach is renowned for its snorkelling, Baby Beach is ideal for children and Palm Beach is well located for a post bathing beer. Feeling more active? Aruba's trade winds offer ideal conditions for windsurfing and kite surfing at Arashi beach.  Lounge under the Divi-Divi trees  Aruba's unofficial trademark, the distinctive Divi-Divi tree (also known as watapana) stretches out at weird and wonderful angles. Locals use the iconic tree as a natural compass, as they always point in a southwesterly direction due to the trade winds that blow across the island from the northeast.  Make a pilgrimage to the Chapel of Alto Vista  You can't fail to miss the Chapel of Alto Vista with its bright yellow exterior acting as a beacon to worshippers. Also known by locals as the ""Pilgrim's Church"", it is located on the north coast and boasts a 100-year-old hand-carved oak altar.  Marvel at the cave art  The three best-known caves in Aruba are located in Arikok National Park and contain some fantastic examples of early cave drawings. Arawak Indians, the original inhabitants of Aruba, used to reside in Fontein and their primitive art remains on the walls. The caves at Guadirikiri are a haven for bats, while Huliba Cave is the place for romance, apparently (it's nicknamed the ""tunnel of love"").  Party hard at the Bonbini Festival  Hedonists are well catered for in Aruba's colourful capital, Oranjestad, which hosts the Bonbini Festival every Tuesday. This weekly shindig takes place in the courtyard of the Historical Museum and offers an insight into local customs, music and cuisine, as well as a chance to get to know the islanders.  Saddle up and go horse riding  Exploring Aruba on horseback is a highlight for many visitors. There are riding trails throughout the countryside and along the coast. Choose one of the many ranches or horse-riding tours and you'll soon see why it's one of the most popular things to do Aruba.  Shop till you drop  Duty-free shopping entices many to part with their cash in Aruba. There are shopping malls across the island, specialising in everything from jewellery and homeware to leather goods and designer fashion. The most popular place to melt the credit card is Caya GF Betico Croes in Oranjestad.  Strut your stuff at Carnival  Aruba's annual Carnival kicks off in January and the party keeps rolling until the Tuesday before Ash Wednesday. During these hedonistic weeks visitors can shake their meat to the local beat, admire dazzling costumes and watch colourful processions. The question is: can you keep up?  Tee off for a round of golf  Golfers can enjoy three courses in Aruba of varying size. Aruba Golf Club and The Links at Divi Aruba both offer 9-hole courses that are fine for a swift round. However, if you have, time tee off at Aruba Tierra del Sol's beautiful 18-hole course, which is easily the pick of the bunch.  Unearth artefacts at the Archaeological Museum of Aruba  The Archaeological Museum of Aruba has reopened in the restored historic Ecury complex in central Oranjestad. A former family home, the building has been transformed to a state-of-the-art museum that preserves Aruba's Amerindian cultural heritage. This is the perfect place to get up to speed on the rich culture and history of the island.  Unwind in colourful Oranjestad  Aruba's Dutch colonial history is most evident in the capital, Oranjestad, which abounds with pretty gabled buildings. Also here is Fort Zoutman, the oldest building on Aruba (1796), and home to the Aruba Historical Museum. Fresh fish can be bought straight from the boat at Oranjestad's daily market in the Paardenbaai (Schooner Harbour).",caribbean,,
ireland,"Ireland is one of the globe’s most singular travel destinations, a feisty, twinkling country far more famous for the sum of its parts than for any specific sight or attraction. Its landscapes are raw, its cities are animated and its history holds endless tales of adversity. Tying all this together is the Irish character, a fabled combination of bright-eyed bonhomie and bar-room banter: there’s good reason why the planet’s full of Irish pubs.      Lovable Dublin falls naturally as the most popular option for first-time visitors, although for all the capital city’s stately architecture and riverside charm, it only partly hints at what the wider country has to offer. The real spirit of today’s nation might be up for debate – it’s as likely to be found in a Connemara village as a Cork street scene – but searching for it is hugely enjoyable.      It’s often said that there are two Irelands. Despite its economic woes, 21st-century Ireland is a modern destination, full of fresh creativity. At the same time, of course, it’s somewhere rooted in the strongest of traditions, a country marked by humour, hospitality and more than the occasional late night. The craic of legend isn’t generally hard to find.        With all this in mind, it’s perhaps no surprise that Ireland caters for such a broad range of interests. Those in search of windswept hikes, Celtic relics and fiddle-and-song pubs will be well sated, but so too will those looking for on-trend gastronomy, family-friendly attractions or slick hotels. The country may be small but its cultural impact worldwide continues to be enormous, and this is due to far more than just a romantic notion of how it used to be.      Various icons and images enjoy close associations with Ireland (see everything from craggy peninsulas to pints of Guinness) but the real beauty of the country is the fact that it transcends every cliché that people throw at it. Its potential for adventure – for real, blood-pumping adventure – is all too often overlooked, while for those who just want to take it easy, the options are copious.","Ireland  Attractions in Ireland  Circle the Ring of Kerry  Explore the iconic Ring of Kerry, a stunning, 180km (112-mile) scenic drive around the Iveragh Peninsula. Visitors can travel in either direction (although tour buses should travel anti-clockwise) on the circular route which passes through Kenamare, Sneem, Waterville, Cahersiveen, Kells, Glenbeigh and Killorglin, with specific sights of interest in each location.  Dilly-dally on the Dingle  Located on the western tip of County Kerry, the dramatic Dingle Peninsula is a popular diversion off the Ring of Kerry tourist trail. It is made up of the Macgillicuddy's Reeks mountain range, a series of granite peaks that rise out of the Atlantic. Walking, cycling and dolphin-spotting are among its most popular draws.  Drive the Wild Atlantic Way  Looking for a road trip worth the name? Start the ignition in County Donegal, point the car south and keep going. The Wild Atlantic Way hugs the coastline for some 2,500 km (1,550 miles), snaking past nine counties and taking in all manner of wild bays and time-burnished villages en route.  Explore Kilkenny  The medieval, alley-threaded city of Kilkenny is renowned for its theatres, galleries and history-steeped buildings, most notably its bulky castle and its atmospheric Gothic cathedral. The city's pubs and nightlife are best enjoyed during one of its yearly festivals, which include the superb Cat Laughs comedy festival and the Kilkenny Arts Festival.  Gaze up at the Rock of Cashel  Sitting high on a limestone base, County Tipperary's Rock of Cashel (also known as the Cashel of the Kings) is one of Ireland's most spectacular castle complexes. Its origins date back to the 4th century, and King Aengus was baptised here by St Patrick, Ireland's patron saint, in the 5th century.  Head out to the islands  Ireland's islands range from the genteel, garden-patterned Garinish in County Cork to the wild and wonderful Tory off the shores of County Donegal. The Aran Islands – reachable from Galway – are the most popular, known for their geological formation and historic monuments. Many islands are also rich in old-time culture, with a lot of locals speaking Irish as their first language.  Kiss the Blarney Stone  Set in the Cork countryside, Blarney Castle is home to the famous Blarney Stone. Situated high in the battlements of the castle, the stone is thought to be half of the Stone of Scone. Those that kiss it are said to inherit the gift of eloquent speech – although you'll need to contort yourself upside-down to plant it with a smacker.  Look out from the Cliffs of Moher  The majestic Cliffs of Moher are one of Ireland's most awe-inspiring natural attractions, towering 213m (700ft) above the Atlantic Ocean. They've featured in everything from Harry Potter films to Westlife videos. The cliffs host a rich array of birdlife, including puffins, shags, kittiwakes and razorbills.  Lose yourself in Killarney National Park  Killarney National Park covers over 10,000 hectares (25,000 acres) of oak woodland, lakes, mountains, parks and gardens in the far southwest of Ireland. It was Ireland's first national park when it was founded in 1932, and its population of red deer, cormorants, salmon and trout helped it to be designated a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in 1982.  Pay your respects to Our Lady of Knock (Ireland’s National Marian Shrine)  Located in County Mayo, the National Shrine of Our Lady of Knock marks the site where, on 21 August 1879, it's said the Virgin Mary, Joseph and St. John the Evangelist all appeared to two dumbstruck young women at the church's south gable. It still attracts hordes of pilgrims.  Raise a glass at the Guinness Storehouse  Dublin's Guinness Storehouse is a brewery-turned-museum dedicated to Ireland's most famous export. Arthur Guinness first began brewing the 'black gold' on the site in 1759, with the present-day building used for fermenting and storing Guinness until the 1980s. Tours explain the brewing process and conclude with a free pint in the Gravity Bar, which offers lofty views across the city.  Slow down at Glendalough  Glendalough is a beautiful glacially sculpted valley in County Wicklow. During Ireland's 'Golden Age' (AD 500-900), a reclusive monk, St Kevin, established a monastic settlement here; the ruins and the forest views make for a memorable sight on a sunny day. The area's name translates, accurately enough, as 'Valley of the Two Lakes'.  Spend time in Cork  Grand Georgian parades, craic-filled pubs and a laidback vibe make the southern city of Cork a viable rival to Dublin for the title of Ireland's most immersive metropolis. Some locals smilingly refer to it as 'The People's Republic of Cork' and the place unquestionably has a spirit of its own, not to mention a bucket load of cultural attractions.  Step into the past at Bunratty Castle  County Clare's Bunratty Castle is the most complete medieval fortress in Ireland, featuring 15th- and 16th-century furnishings, tapestries, and artwork. A Folk Park lies in the grounds, recreating buildings including a school and post office. Regular 'medieval banquets' are held to give guests a taste of what it was like to be entertained in the castle's heyday.  Visit Kilmainham Gaol  Get to grips with the hard edge of Irish history with a visit to Dublin's Kilmainham Gaol, where rebels against British rule were incarcerated from the late 1700s until the 1920s. Chillingly, it's also where the leaders of the 1916 Easter Rising were executed – the tour takes in the bleak yard where they were put to death.  Walk the Wicklow Way  Explore Ireland on foot by walking one of the country's 31 designated long-distance paths. One of the best known is the Wicklow Way, which runs from the Dublin suburbs to County Carlow in the southeast. Other notable options include the Connemara Way – full of sweeping, silent hill scenery – and the historic Kerry Way, which makes use of old driving paths.  Wander St Stephen’s Green  Take a stroll around Dublin's most popular city square, where landscaped parklands hold everything from the WB Yeats Memorial Garden to a bust of James Joyce. Some of the city's finest hotels overlook the square, and it remains an integral part of Dublin's fabric.  Watch traditional Gaelic sports  The thrill of a game of Gaelic football – a mix between rugby, football and American football (without pads) – is an unmissable experience.  So too is the ancient game of hurling, where players use a hurley (wooden stick) to hit a sliotar (small ball) into the opponents' goalposts. Both sports are vociferously followed at the top level.",europe,,
kiribati,"White sandy beaches and crystal-clear lagoon waters characterise the Republic of Kiribati, which is made up of over 30 coral islands scattered across the Pacific. Kiribati is remote, and the tourism industry remains very much in its infancy – all the more reason to visit sooner rather than later.  They may be relatively unknown, but the isles are peppered with swaying coconut palms, swathed in balmy breezes, and waters glistening in every direction. And so it's hard to feel anything other than intense holiday escapism. While lazing on desolate beaches is a huge draw, Kiribati does have an interesting population of both human and wildlife.  Capital Tarawa is fast becoming one of the most densely populated areas in the Pacific, while Christmas Island, stretching for almost half the land mass of Kiribati, is carpeted with lakes and ponds great for game fishing, and boasts some of the largest colonies of birds.  Other islands include Phoenix, Line and Gilbert – during British rule in the 19th and 20th centuries, Kiribati was known as the Gilbert Islands. In World War II, the islands were occupied by Japan, while in the post-war era the US and UK used Christmas island for nuclear weapons tests. The islands finally became independent in 1979.  Despite Kiribati's colonial history, many of its islands have remained much the same as they've ever been. Locals live off breadfruit, fish and coconuts to this day. The inhabitants of the main island Tarawa also continue to live in raised thatched huts like their ancestors.  You needn't fear a total separation from civilisation, however, as bars, cinemas, cars and the internet are increasingly a part of life in Kiribati. The people aren't unwelcoming, but you're more likely to be greeted by the children than adults, who tend to eye visitors cautiously. Once you break the ice, you'll find a fascinating culture, and plenty of glorious nature to explore.  The tiny nation is only 800 km sq, but if you include the many atolls, this rises to a 3.5 million km square-swathe of the Pacific. Better get the swimming costume on.","Kiribati  Attractions in Kiribati  Embrace the bustle of South Tarawa  Most visitors to Kiribati skip the capital and head straight to the archipelago's sandy shores. It's easy to see why: bustling South Tarawa is not the prettiest town and its tourist infrastructure is somewhat limited. But if you want to get a true slice of local life – explore local markets and meet the locals – this is the place to be.  Explore Kiribati’s underwater treasures  Kiribati has the distinction of being the world's largest coral atoll, and is a dream destination for divers. The archipelago's beautiful white sandy beaches and crystal-clear lagoons give way to wonderful coral gardens, much of which fall into the Phoenix Island Protected Area, one of the world's largest marine reserves.  Get a bird’s-eye view of Kiribati  A fine way to get the whole picture of Kiribati is to take a ""flight-seeing"" trip on one of the many light aircraft that serve the region. Tours take in the islands of Abaiang, Abemama, Maiana and Tarawa, and other islands can be visited on request.  Go birdwatching  Birdwatching is popular, especially on Christmas Island where millions of birds swarm everywhere. The archipelago is a major breeding ground and sanctuary for birds in the Pacific and even has its own endemic species: the Christmas Island Warbler. The best time for birdwatching is between June and December.  Imbibe local culture  Every village in Kiribati has a maneaba, or community centre. Made of coconut wood and pandanus leaves, maneabas are the administrative headquarters of the islands villages, but they are also a place where visitors can enjoy traditional dancing, singing and storytelling.  Learn about Kiribati’s wartime history  Some of the bloodiest fighting between US and Japanese forces took place in Kiribati and the surrounding islands during WWII. A number of war relics can be seen on Tarawa and Butaritari Island, including defence guns, rusting tanks and concrete bunkers. Tours of battlegrounds can also be arranged.  Make a seasonal trip to Christmas Island  Actually, you don't have to wait till the festive season to visit this stunning atoll. Occupying almost half the landmass of Kiribati, Christmas Island is covered in lakes and ponds and boasts some of the largest bird colonies in the archipelago. The atoll is also a gateway to Kiribati's world-renowned coral reefs.  Try your hand at game fishing  Game fishing is particularly popular on the island and in particular Christmas Island. It's of a world-class standard and has been the site of many international game fishing world records. Another big lure to Kiribati is the prevalence of the magnificent bonefish.",oceania,,
maine,"Moose the size of mammoths, lobster so fresh you could revive them, sweeping sandy beaches, rugged cliffs, verdant pine forests, and mountains as far as the eye can see: welcome to Maine.      Suffice to say natural wonders abound, but the jewel in Maine’s crown has to be Acadia National Park on Mount Desert Island, where cyclists and horses pootle along historic carriage roads, climbers tackle lofty sea cliffs and hikers follow forest trails tramped by American Indians.      Between October and March, you can snap the sunrise before anyone else in the country from Cadillac Mountain, the highest peak on the US Atlantic coast. After dark, gaze at the star-speckled sky above Bar Harbor, which resembles an out-of-reception TV set. Extraordinary.      Further south, Maine’s coast delivers the quintessential New England seaside experience, complete with historic lighthouses, hidden coves, lobster shacks and giant sweeps of sand.      Inland, hardcore hikers complete the 3,510km (2,181 miles) Appalachian Trail at Katahdin. Maine’s section is no walk in the park: the toughest stretch of the entire trail covers 452km (281 miles) of gnarly tree roots, squelchy bogs, treacherous stream crossings and precipitous climbs.      The activities don’t stop there. Leaf peepers scale the lookout tower on Bald Mountain to gaze at a Jackson Pollock-esque splatter of autumnal colours. Canoeists paddle the Northern Forest Canoe Trail, connecting the waterways of New York, Vermont, Quebec, New Hampshire and Maine. Rafters bounce through class 4 rapids in the Kennebec Gorge. And golfers tee off at Sugarloaf Mountain, then trade places with skiers in winter.      If you’re craving city life, head to Portland, a neat coastal metropolis buzzing with refreshing microbreweries, alfresco eateries and terrific arts performances. ‘Life’s good here,’ reads the city slogan. It’s hard to disagree.","Maine  Attractions in Maine  Art galleries and antique shops  Browse the bookshops, art galleries and antique shops of Kennebunk, Camden and Rockland.

delaware,"Tiny Delaware is a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it state for drivers heading down the East Coast, but turn off the highway and this pocket-sized region packs in glorious beaches, rambling historic estates and enticing tax-free shopping.      Fronting a broad sweep of sand peppered with parasols, Rehoboth Beach Boardwalk is a classic Atlantic seaside spot, humming with whirring arcades, pizzerias chock-full of chattering families, and confectioners spooning out caramel popcorn and a rainbow assortment of salt water taffy.      A little to the south, Bethany Beach welcomes more than 100 artisans to its boardwalk each September for an arts festival showcasing everything from jewellery to watercolours. And right by the Maryland border, Fenwick Island’s waves lure windsurfers, while kayakers paddle the still waters of Little Assawoman Bay before filling up on all-you-can-eat steamed crabs.      Delaware was the first state to ratify the United States Constitution, back in 1787, and Lewes became the first town in the first state. You can cruise along the canal front by bike or explore Cape Henlopen State Park’s swimming beaches, nature trails and WWII observation tower.      Away from the coast, the sprawling homes and elaborate gardens of the du Pont family have more than a whiff of French châteaux about them. The family originally emigrated from France in 1800, establishing a gunpowder works along the Brandywine Creek in Wilmington and thus making their fortune.      You can save a fortune too in Delaware: tax-free shopping is as big a draw as the beach, and outlet malls and upmarket shopping centres tempt you to spend big on clothes, computers and, well, anything that’s going to persuade you to part with your cash.","Delaware  Attractions in Delaware  Brandywine Valley  Head to Brandywine Valley, home to the Du Pont mansions and the the Hagley Museum (www.hagley.org), which explains how this powerful family's fortune was made.  Delaware Art Museum  View the permanent collection of 19th- and 20th-century American art and Pre-Raphaelite English art of the 19th century at the Delaware Art Museum (www.delart.org), including works by Edward Hopper, Howard Pyle and Andrew Wyeth.

morocco,"Known for its incredible cultural riches, Morocco has fascinated travellers for centuries. The name usually conjures up images of sprawling souks, walled medinas and towering minarets calling Muslims to prayer.      Morocco's biggest drawing card is Marrakech (also spelt Marrakesh), a vibrant city that Winston Churchill once described as ""simply the nicest place on Earth to spend an afternoon."" This sentiment still rings true for many travellers today.      But Morocco is more than just Marrakech. Tangier, in the north, sits just 13km (8mi) away from Gibraltar and is characterised by its whitewashed buildings and sandy beaches. Further down the Atlantic coast, you will soon come across Morocco's capital city Rabat, cosmopolitan Casablanca, atmospheric Essaouira, and the lively beach resort of Agadir, the latter is a firm favourite among sun-seekers and surfers. Inland, Fes (also spelt Fez) is a well-preserved medieval city famed for its high-walled medina. Talking about medinas, which essentially mean old walled towns, it is worth mentioning that the medinas of Essaouira, Fes, Marrakech and Tétouan are all on UNESCO's World Heritage list.      Beyond the cities, awesome landscapes await. Like an elongated spine, the Atlas Mountains run from the southwest to the centre of Morocco, before extending eastward to Algeria and Tunisia. These rugged landscapes offer spectacular scenery from deep gorges, verdant valleys to snow-capped peaks. People come here to trek, bike, or scale Mount Toubkal, the highest peak in the Atlas Mountains. The areas are also home to the Berber people, whose unique culture, crafts and costumes make for a fascinating visit.      While Morocco is generally a safe country to visit, travellers interested in the disputed territory of Western Sahara should seek the latest travel advice from their own government before departing. This sparsely-populated territory, which sits in the south of Morocco and northwest of Mauritania, is partly controlled by Morocco, a claim that the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR), whose government is in exile in Algeria, disagrees. The sovereignty issue remains a sensitive subject.","Morocco  Attractions in Morocco  Casablanca  The economic hub of Morocco, Casablanca is a bustling metropolis filled to the brim with modern high-rises amid colonial art-deco buildings. Everywhere you turn, you can't miss the minaret of the stunning Hassan II Mosque. It is worth joining a tour to see the mosque interior, taking in the frescoes with geometrical motifs, intricate stuccoes, and arabesques with drawn or calligraphic motifs.  Chefchaouen  With pastel-blue painted houses scattering down a slope of the Rif Mountains, Chefchaouen is a pretty town. Chaouen, as it is otherwise known, is also a paradise for walkers keen to explore Morocco's most northerly mountain chains. Some tourists also come to seek out cannabis plantations in this mountainous region.  Fes (Fez)  Often called Morocco's cultural capital, Fes (or Fez) was once an imperial city of Morocco in the 13th century. Today, it is known for its vibrant Fes El Bali medina and souks, including the Chouara Tannery (one of the three in Fes with hundreds of containers filled with dye or white liquids).  Marrakech (Marrakesh)  Marrakech, also spelt Marrakesh, is known for its colourful souks which cover many winding alleyways in the northside of Jemaa El-Fna Square. Other popular activities include taking a breather in Jardin Majorelle, visiting the atmospheric El Badii Palace and getting an intimate glance into the lives of 19th-century royalty at Bahia Palace.  Medinas  A medina is an old walled town crisscrossed with narrow alleyways. It usually has a few mosques (known as jemaas), palaces, and a main square where commercial activities occur. The medinas of Essaouira, Fes, Marrakech and Tétouan are all on UNESCO's World Heritage list and well worth a visit.  National Parks and biospheres  Morocco has 11 national parks and several biospheres and reserves. Toubkal National Park, home to the highest peak in the Atlas Mountains, is most popular for trekking, while Souss-Massa National Park, near Agadir, offers beaches, cliffs, dunes, and Argania forests. Birdwatchers, on the other hand, seek out Oued-Massa Nature Reserve thanks to its rich bird fauna, both native and migrating.  Rabat  Rabat is Morocco's capital city and has a beautiful blend of historic and modern buildings. The old town, surrounded by defensive walls, has a busy souk and a small mellah or Jewish quarter. Beyond it, wide boulevards are lined with embassies and government buildings, interspersed by attractive parks.  The Ksar of Aït Ben haddou  Chances are, you've seen the ksar (buildings made of mud bricks and fortified with high walls) of Aït Ben Haddou in some Hollywood blockbusters before, as they were featured in hits like Gladiator, The Mummy and Game of Thrones.  Todgha Gorge  About 390km (242mi) east of Marrakesh lies the Todgha Gorge, a magnet for photographers, hikers and rock climbers. The canyon floor, which is either dry or has a trickling stream at times, offers travellers a chance to walk and look up at the imposing stone walls. Beware that sunlight only reaches the canyon floor for a few hours each day; hence the temperatures can be chilly.",africa,,
chile,"A narrow slither of land wedged between the Pacific and the Andes, Chile stands as a nation apart in South America – both literally and figuratively. The mountains cut the country off from Argentina and Bolivia to the east, while the expansive Atacama Desert separates it from Peru to the north. And to the south, beyond the country’s infamous Cape Horn headland, lies nothing but ocean and Antarctica. But far from being a curse, this isolation has created a very special destination indeed.      Whether you fancy road-tripping the endless Carretera Austral, climbing the peaks of Torres del Paine National Park or surfing the brutal waves of Punta de Lobos in Pichilemu, Chile is deserving of its reputation as one of the world’s best destinations for adventure tourism. It’s not just for thrill-seekers, though. From its incredible night skies and Mapuche Indian heritage to its vibrant arts scene and vertiginous vineyards, this is a country that caters for travellers of all hues. The Chileans themselves, meanwhile, tend to be warm and open, so absorbing what the country has to offer is generally a joy.      The country hasn’t always had it easy, of course, and the tribulations of the Pinochet era can be explored in the dynamic capital, Santiago. The city’s buzzing boulevards and arty neighbourhoods feel a million miles away from Chile’s more famous attractions, and this in itself tells you how broad the country’s offering is – this is a land that not only includes vast swathes of Patagonian wilderness and the glacier-threaded waterways of Tierra del Fuego, but also incorporates the remote, statue-studded landmass of Easter Island.      Whether you’re seeking solitude as a leisurely backpacker or taking on the big sights in unbridled luxury, consider yourself warned – once you’ve experienced the myriad attractions Chile has to offer, you may find other destinations fall somewhat short.","Chile  Attractions in Chile  Discover Chile’s northern delights  Northern Chile offers a dazzling plethora of attractions: visit the fishing village of Los Choros to spot bottle-nosed dolphins and sea otters off shore. World surfing championships are held at Arica and Pichilemu, but Punta de Lobos is the best surf spot for beginners. Explore the eerie mining ghost town of Humberston; and see flamingos and rheas on the salt plains of the Parque Nacional Lauca.  Get the sand between your toes in the Atacama Desert  Let the uniquely arid landscape of the Atacama Desert sweep you away with its broad, stark vistas of volcanoes, salt flats, aquamarine lakes and the abandoned homes of the indigenous Aymara people. The world's driest desert, there are areas of Atacama that haven't seen rain for more than 400 years.  Get up close to the San Rafael Glacier  The star attraction of the superb San Rafael National Park is its eponymous glacier. Witness giant icebergs from a glacier cruise, or kayak out to accessible parts. Longer cruises follow a spectacular route through the Beagle Channel and around Cape Horn, passing glacial valleys, fjords and huge icebergs; with stop-off points en route, notably at Puerto Natales and Tierra del Fuego.  Go whale watching in Francisco Coloane Marine Park  Located in the historic 560km-long (350mile) Strait of Magellan, this is the only site in the southern hemisphere outside of Antarctica where humpback whales can be found feeding. Boat safaris are available from Punta Arenas, from December to April, during the summer months when these majestic cetaceans head north to warmer waters.  Haggle in La Vega Central Market  Raspberries, quinces, figs, peaches, persimmons, custard apples, wine, spices… if it's from Chile, you'll find it at Santiago's La Vega Central Market and Bazaar. Get there early for the best selection and to see the more than 500 enthusiastic vendors in full swing. It's loud, chaotic and crowded, which is all part of the authentic Chilean shopping scene.  Hike up fiery Volcán Villarrica  One of the world's most active volcanoes, Volcán Villarrica near Pucón is safer than it sounds – it is also one of the world's most monitored, so you should have plenty of warning of any imminent eruption. You can hike up Villarrica in a day, with local tour operators running guided walks, and shoot back down on a thrilling toboggan ride.  Kayak through the Chiloé archipelago  The Chiloé islands, which are separated from Chile by the Chacao Channel, have a quirky range of attractions, including colourful old wooden churches, precarious waterfront houses on stilts, and a notable colony of penguins on the main island of Chiloe. Perhaps the most unforgettable experience, however, is a sunrise kayak ride through a petrified forest with one of several local agencies.  Marvel at Chile's lake district  Ideal for watersports, trekking and fly-fishing, this area is heaven for lovers of the great outdoors. The Llanada Grande Valley is great for fishing, as well as many family friendly activities. See millennia-old larch trees in the lush, temperate rainforests of Patagonia at Pumalín Park, a vast nature reserve. Huilo Huilo, an incredible biological reserve, has bundles of activities as well as great accommodation options.  Mingle with the penguins in Antarctica  Voyage to the world's last undiscovered wilderness, Antarctica, from Chile's southernmost city, Punta Arenas. Where else could you find penguins, vertiginous icebergs and live out the fantasy of being Scott of the Antarctic for a few days? Local tour operators in Punta Arenas can help get you there, offering everything from skiing and mountain climbing expeditions to luxury cruises.  Quaff Chile’s fine wines  A short hop from Santiago lieChile's leading wine regions, with tasting tours available for keen oenophiles. The Rapel Valley has earned international recognition for its Carménère and Syrah wines. Concha y Toro, one of Chile's oldest winemakers, is famous for its Carménère. Further south of the capital are the Curicó and Maule valleys, also home to some of Chile's oldest and finest vineyards.  Raft down the rapids  White-water rafting down the country's many rapids is a popular way to experience nature – at high speed. Specialist operators offer up to week-long trips down the Maipo near Santiago, the Trancura near Pucón, as well as the Bio-Bio River in Region VIII. For hard-core rafters looking for an adrenaline rush, however, the impressive Futaleufu River in the south is the ultimate challenge.  Remember Robinson Crusoe on the Juan Fernández Islands  Retrace the footsteps of the real-life Robinson Crusoe in the little known Juan Fernández Islands 650km (403 miles) west of Valparaíso, accessible by plane from Santiago. Scotsman Alexander Selkirk was marooned here in the early 18th century, forming the inspiration for Daniel Defoe's novel Robinson Crusoe. Today, you can visit various sites, including Selkirk's cave and his hilltop lookout.  Search for Valparaíso’s poetic spirit  One of the most atmospheric port cities in Latin America, Valparaiso is a place of sinuous hills, a labyrinth of precipitous streets and bright clapboard houses. Its slightly offbeat charms inspired Pablo Neruda. Chile's best-known Nobel Prize-winning poet, his home, La Sebastiana, is open to visitors. Colour, culture and bohemia sum up this coastal haven located just a little more than an hour from Santiago.  Ski in the Darwin Mountain Range  World-class backcountry skiing can be found in the Darwin Mountain Range at Chile's southernmost tip, where the ski season runs from June to September. For the slightly less adventurous, the famous Portillo resort hosts many national ski teams. Portillo's powder snow is a perfect match for boarders. Other slopes in the area include Farellones-El Colorado, La Parva and Valle Nevado.  Stare at the statues of Easter Island  A lonely volcanic island in the Pacific Ocean, Easter Island is famous for its mysterious stone statues, or moais. Around 300 statues and other stonework form an almost unbroken ring around the coast, still puzzling scientists how and why they were made. Other sites to investigate include the volcano crater Rano Kau, the Orongo rock carvings and the museum in Hanga Roa.  Stargaze in Chile’s clear skies  Glimpse faraway galaxies at one of several powerful observatories situated in the northern Coquimbo region, which is famed for its remarkably clear skies. The best of the best is ALMA (Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array), the world's largest astronomical project, on the Chajnator Plateau in northern Chile. Or set your sights on the powerful Schmidt Cassegrain telescope in the Collowara Observatory, atop Cerro Churqui near La Serena.  Tackle Santiago’s lofty hills  Perched atop Cerro San Cristóbal is the giant statue of the Virgin Mary, a popular spot for city hikers to enjoy a spectacular panorama over Santiago's vast sprawl. Reward yourself for your efforts by stopping off at the foot of the hill in Barrio Bellavista, to visit the eccentric La Chascona, once the Santiago home of poet Pablo Neruda.  Trek through Torres del Paine  The jagged peaks of Torres del Paine are a defining sight of the far south. Its two trekking circuits, the Grande or the W, provide a taste of Patagonian wilderness; and catch the impressive Southern Ice Fields, a trip best made in summer. For the most southern trek in the world, take on the Dientes de Navarino, located further south on Isla Navarino.",south america,,
balearic islands,"Bathed in sunshine and skirted by platinum sands, the Balearic Islands are one of Europe’s prime island getaways. Floating off the coast of mainland Spain, this Mediterranean archipelago is awash with leafy terraces, crumbling heritage sites, secluded coves and poetic hills.      The islands of Mallorca, Menorca, Ibiza and Formentera account for the vast majority of tourism to the region. The largest island, Mallorca, has its fair share package tourists but now also caters for an upscale crowd as well. The resort of Magaluf is a byword for neon-blazed, boozed-up Brits behaving shamefully.      Recently, though, the island has been improving its image: rundown resorts are being replaced with modern facilities and stricter policing means a crackdown on drunkenness. Meanwhile, its capital, Palma, has grown into one of Spain's most beguiling small cities.      Hedonistic Ibiza has long held an illustrious club scene that’s concentrated around the charming hippy-chic capital of Ibiza Town, the high-rise canyons of San António, and across Playa d'en Bossa.      But away from the super clubs and skimpily covered ravers, Ibiza remains remarkably rural and the island’s former allure is far from absent. In its serene centre, olive groves flourish in rich red soil, almond trees bloom white and its northern beaches can be all but deserted.      Both Ibiza and Mallorca offer exceptional beaches, but it’s Menorca that holds the aces for picture-postcard coves. Visitors that follow the island’s fringe path, Cami de Cavalls, are spoilt with shallow bays, crystal seas, craggy inlets and silent sandy shores.      Charming too are Menorca’s towns. The capital, Mahon, is all steep streets and Georgian architecture, while Ciutadella’s charisma is in its old-town tranquility.      As Balearic tourism soared, the island of Formentera, like Menorca, stayed grounded, and its efforts to conserve the coast and rubberstamp only low-rise developments has resulted in a quiet the other isles cannot rival.","Balearic Islands  The Mallorca Pass (www.turbopass.com/mallorca-pass) lets you visit some attractions for free (such as Cathedral of Palma and Palma Aquarium).
